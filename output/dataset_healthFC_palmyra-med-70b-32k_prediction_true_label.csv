Can masks reduce corona infections when worn by a large proportion of the population?,Yes,"Justification: The scientific literature supports the notion that masks can contribute to the control of COVID-19 by reducing the emission of infected saliva and respiratory droplets from individuals with subclinical or mild infections. Observational evidence suggests that mask-wearing mitigates the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, and masks are considered efficacious in limiting the spread of the virus. Masks are thought to have two modes of effect: they prevent infection with COVID-19 in wearers and prevent transmission by individuals with subclinical infections. The use of masks during a pandemic can minimize the spread of influenza and its economic impact. While mask-wearing compliance in adults is often poor, educating the public on the effectiveness of masks can increase compliance and reduce morbidity and mortality. Masks, even with suboptimal efficacy, could substantially decrease the reproduction number for COVID-19 if widely used.",Yes

Can zeolite alleviate or prevent health problems?,Yes,"Zeolite, specifically the synthetic silicate zeolite 4a, has demonstrated potential in alleviating and preventing various health problems. Its antioxidant activities have been found to be equivalent to those of vitamin E, suggesting its usefulness as a modulator of oxidative stress, particularly in smokers. Zeolite has also shown promise in maintaining general health and well-being, as well as preventing iron-induced deleterious effects following iron overload. Furthermore, it has been suggested to decrease the uptake of radio-caesium by humans and domestic animals, and to accelerate the excretion of radio-caesium that has already been absorbed. Zeolite's potential benefits extend to improving skin-whitening, as it has been found to inhibit melanin production in a dose-dependent manner. Additionally, zeolite has demonstrated beneficial effects on intestinal wall integrity, as indicated by decreased concentrations of the tight junction modulator zonulin. These findings suggest that zeolite could potentially alleviate or prevent health problems related to oxidative stress, iron overload, radiation exposure, skin pigmentation, and intestinal permeability. However, more research is needed to fully understand its underlying mechanisms and potential applications in human ailments and diseases.",NEI

Does extract from the Damiana plant (Turnera diffusa) help with erectile dysfunction?,Yes,"The experimental evidence supports the traditional use of Turnera diffusa, also known as Damiana, as an aphrodisiac and suggests its potential therapeutic properties for treating sexual dysfunction, including erectile dysfunction. Studies have shown that an aqueous extract of Turnera diffusa facilitated the expression of male sexual behavior in rats by shortening ejaculation latency. Additionally, Turnera diffusa and sildenafil (both at 10 mg/kg) improved sexual performance in male rats. The pro-sexual effect of Turnera diffusa in rats has been found to involve the participation of the nitric oxide (NO) pathway, mainly at the central level. Furthermore, the extract of Turnera diffusa and two isolated compounds, pinocembrin and acacetin, could significantly suppress aromatase activity, which is involved in the conversion of testosterone to estrogen. This suggests that Turnera diffusa may help maintain testosterone levels, which is crucial for male sexual function. Therefore, based on the available evidence, it can be concluded that Turnera diffusa may have a beneficial effect on erectile dysfunction.",NEI

Does regular HPV testing in addition to the recommended Pap smear detect more precancerous lesions than just the Pap smear alone?,Yes,"Justification: Regular HPV testing, in conjunction with the recommended Pap smear, has been shown to improve the detection of cervical precancer and cancer compared to Pap smear alone. This is due to the fact that high-risk HPV infections are causally involved in the development of cervical cancer. HPV testing is more sensitive than cervical cytology for detecting both high-grade and low-grade dysplasia. Combining HPV and Pap screening can achieve very good risk stratification and sensitive detection of precancerous lesions and cancer. However, it is important to note that HPV testing is less specific than Pap smear cytology, and additional triage testing of HPV-positive women is necessary to identify those with cervical (pre)cancer. Incorporation of HPV testing into the present Pap screening program has the potential of making screening for cervical cancer more effective.",Yes

However, more studies are needed to establish the safety and efficacy of CBD in this specific context.",NEI
Can laser irradiation of blood by infusion needle (hemolaser treatment) relieve discomfort or help with diseases?,Yes,"Evidence suggests that laser irradiation of blood by infusion needle, also known as hemolaser treatment, can indeed relieve discomfort and help with diseases. In vitro studies have demonstrated that low-power, near-infra-red laser irradiation can improve the rheological properties of blood, such as blood viscosity, erythrocyte deformability, and sedimentation rate. These improvements in blood properties have been shown to have positive effects on various pathological processes. Furthermore, laser therapy has been found to be an effective method for pain treatment and the acceleration of wound healing. In the case of hemorrhoids, laser treatment has been shown to be effective in pain alleviation from the first session, leading to a more comfortable postoperative course for patients. The use of laser treatment might also improve the outcome of other therapeutic modalities such as tumour ionizing radiation therapy and local chemotherapy. Therefore, it can be concluded that hemolaser treatment has the potential to relieve discomfort and help with diseases.",NEI
"In everyday life, when breathing with an FFP2 mask or ordinary mouth-nose protection, do you get as much oxygen as without a mask?",Yes,"In the context of oxygen delivery, studies have shown that the use of various masks can result in different levels of oxygenation. However, it is important to note that these studies primarily focus on medical scenarios and specific oxygen delivery systems, not everyday masks such as FFP2 or ordinary mouth-nose protection.

In the case of FFP2 masks and ordinary mouth-nose protection, these masks are designed to filter out particles and droplets, not to restrict the flow of oxygen. The materials used in these masks are breathable and do not significantly impede the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that in everyday life, when breathing with an FFP2 mask or ordinary mouth-nose protection, one should get as much oxygen as without a mask. However, individual experiences may vary, and factors such as the fit of the mask and the physical condition of the wearer can affect the level of oxygenation.",Yes

Does arthroscopy (joint endoscopy) help with osteoarthritis of the knee joint?,NEI,"The effectiveness of arthroscopy for the treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee remains a subject of debate. While some studies suggest that arthroscopic treatment regimens can improve function and activity levels in patients with moderate to severe osteoarthritis, there is limited evidence-based research to support its use as a treatment method. The benefits of arthroscopy for the treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee are often attributed to a placebo effect, providing subjective pain relief. Despite the lack of consensus guidelines and randomized control trials, the use of arthroscopy for the treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee has increased over the last decade. However, recent literature suggests that knee arthroscopy in the setting of osteoarthritis is no better than placebo. Therefore, it is not possible to definitively conclude whether arthroscopy helps with osteoarthritis of the knee joint.",No
"Do dietary supplements containing silicon (e.g. as ""organic silicon"" or silica) have health benefits?",Yes,"Dietary supplements containing silicon, such as ""organic silicon"" or silica, have been reported to have health benefits based on previous studies. Silicon has been shown to have a positive effect on bone health, immune response, and cognitive health, with benefits for bone mineral density, skin rejuvenation, and lymphocyte proliferation. Bioavailable forms of silicon, such as silicic acid, have been observed to enhance osteogenesis and collagen synthesis, and may play a role in reducing metal accumulation in Alzheimer's disease and reducing the risk for atherosclerosis. Additionally, dietary silicon supplementation has been suggested to have a protective effect against aluminum absorption and accumulation in the brain. However, further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms of action and potential therapeutic applications of silicon in human health.",NEI
Can regular intake of cranberry juice or cranberry extract prevent recurrent cystitis in women?,Yes,"Evidence suggests that regular intake of cranberry juice or cranberry extract may reduce the risk of recurrent cystitis in women. Two randomized controlled trials involving a total of approximately 300 young women demonstrated that daily use of cranberry juice or tablets reduced the relapse rate for acute cystitis. On average, treating 100 women for one year prevented at least one urinary tract infection in 15 to 33 women. Additionally, there is evidence from two good quality randomized controlled trials that cranberry juice may decrease the number of symptomatic urinary tract infections over a 12-month period in women. However, larger high-quality studies are needed to confirm these findings.",Yes
Will women who have recurrent bladder infections get rid of them faster if they take cranberry products only after the disease is already there???,No,"Justification: The available evidence suggests that cranberry products may have a role in preventing urinary tract infections (UTIs) in older females, but there is limited evidence to support their effectiveness in treating existing UTIs. Two randomized controlled trials involving a total of about 300 young women showed that daily use of cranberry juice or tablets reduced the relapse rate for acute cystitis, but a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of the effects of cranberry on risk of recurring UTI among 319 college women presenting with an acute UTI found that cranberry juice did not significantly reduce UTI risk compared with placebo. Additionally, a study involving otherwise healthy college women with an acute UTI found that those drinking 8 oz of 27% cranberry juice twice daily did not experience a decrease in the 6-month incidence of a second UTI compared with those drinking a placebo. These findings suggest that cranberry products are not likely to help women get rid of existing UTIs faster.",NEI
Can extract from St. John's wort relieve the symptoms of depression? Is it similarly effective as drugs against depression (antidepressants)?,Yes,"Extract from St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) has been found to relieve symptoms of mild to moderate depression, as evidenced by numerous scientific publications and meta-analyses. The herbal antidepressant has been shown to be more effective than placebo and equally as effective as tricyclic antidepressants in the short-term management of mild-to-moderate depression. The compounds in St. John's wort herbal preparations, including hyperforin, have been suggested to contribute to its antidepressant efficacy. However, the efficacy of St. John's wort for treating major depression, cyclothymia, or bipolar disorder is less evident. It is important to note that the mode of action of St. John's wort is different from that of conventional antidepressant drugs, which elevate brain serotonin and evoke negative feedback control of serotonergic neurons.",Yes
"Does the Zisano bracelet strengthen the immune system, increase endurance and performance or reduce fatigue?",NEI,"The provided context does not explicitly mention the Zisano bracelet and its composition or properties. Therefore, it is not possible to definitively conclude whether the Zisano bracelet strengthens the immune system, increases endurance and performance, or reduces fatigue based solely on the given information.

However, the context does indicate that zinc is essential for the functions of the immune system and has potential implications on exercise performance and physical activity. Additionally, pharmacological zinc supplementation has been suggested to improve immune responses and enhance humoral and cell-mediated immunity.

Therefore, if the Zisano bracelet contains zinc or other substances that affect zinc levels in the body, it may have potential benefits for the immune system, endurance, and performance. However, further research and information about the specific composition and properties of the Zisano bracelet are needed to make a definitive conclusion.",NEI
"Does microimmunotherapy improve symptoms of allergies, cancer, joint inflammation, autoimmune diseases, dementia or various viral infections?",Yes,"Immunotherapy, including microimmunotherapy, has been shown to improve symptoms of allergic diseases by producing immunologic changes. It has also been demonstrated to play a key role in the treatment of infections and cancer, as well as allergic diseases. Topical immunotherapy may represent an important improvement in the therapy of inflammatory dermatoses, viral infections, and cancers of the skin and genital mucosa. Immunotherapy has the potential to modify or re-balance the immune system, making it useful in the management of autoimmune conditions and ameliorating immune-based pathologies. Recent data suggest that immunotherapy may have a role in preventing the development of new sensitizations or in decreasing the progression of allergic disease. These immunomodulatory activities improve the symptoms of respiratory diseases associated with chronic inflammation. In vivo studies have shown that mesenchymal stem cell transplantation significantly improves the condition of a number of autoimmune diseases. The use of anti-cytokine therapy in rheumatoid arthritis has improved the quality of life of patients with refractory disease. The locally generated immune milieu leads to a Th1-dominance and cell-mediated immunity that have been clinically used to treat viral infections. Therapies directed against specific effector molecules hold promise in immune modulation of allergic disease. Topical immunotherapy with both immunostimulatory and immunosuppressive agents bears potential for effective and patient-friendly treatment of inflammatory, infectious, and cancerous skin diseases. Allergen immunotherapy has been shown to be efficacious in numerous studies for the clinical indications of allergic asthma and rhinitis, as well as hymenoptera venom hypersensitivity.",NEI
Can ginkgo extract improve mental performance in dementia patients?,Yes,"Ginkgo biloba extract (GBE) has been shown to enhance cognitive function and ameliorate mild to moderate dementia in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other neurological disorders. Multiple clinical trials and systematic reviews have demonstrated the efficacy of GBE in improving cognitive symptoms associated with aging-related cognitive impairment and dementia, including AD. Although the pharmacological mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of GBE remain unclear, its use as a treatment for cognitive impairment is supported by positive results from good-quality placebo-controlled studies. GBE has been suggested to be useful in the treatment of various symptoms of impaired brain functions in advanced age, including decreased memory performance, lack of concentration, and decreased alertness. However, the evidence for any beneficial effects of longer treatment with GBE is less well-established.",Yes
Does pine wood improve sleep?,NEI,"The context does not provide direct information on whether pine wood improves sleep. However, it mentions that the wood of the Cembran pine (Pinus cembra L.) has a long-lasting odor that relieves stress in humans. Stress relief is often associated with improved sleep quality. Nevertheless, no explicit studies or evidence are presented to confirm that pine wood directly improves sleep. Therefore, based on the given context, it is not possible to definitively conclude that pine wood improves sleep. Further research is needed to establish a clear connection between pine wood and sleep improvement.",NEI
Do spermidine supplements or a spermidine-rich diet reduce the risk of Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia? Do they help with existing dementia?,Yes,"Evidence suggests that spermidine intake has a beneficial impact on memory functions in both animal models and humans. This polyamine has been associated with a positive impact on memory performance in older adults with subjective cognitive decline. Higher dietary spermidine intake has been positively associated with several structural brain measures, irrespective of the presence of subjective cognitive decline. Spermidine levels decline with aging, and a possible connection between reduced endogenous spermidine concentrations and age-related deterioration has been suggested. Spermidine preserves mitochondrial function, exhibits anti-inflammatory properties, and prevents stem cell senescence. Nutritional intervention with spermidine has been shown to prevent memory loss in aging model organisms and attenuate age-associated deterioration of synaptic transmission and plasticity. These findings suggest that spermidine supplements or a spermidine-rich diet may reduce the risk of Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia, and potentially help with existing dementia. However, further research is needed to confirm these findings and establish the optimal dosage and duration of spermidine supplementation.",NEI
Do green-lipped mussel preparations improve the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis?,NEI,"The scientific literature suggests that green-lipped mussel preparations have shown potential for improving symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis, primarily due to their anti-inflammatory properties. However, the evidence is not entirely consistent, as only a few randomized controlled trials have demonstrated benefits for rheumatoid and osteoarthritis patients. Lipid extracts from hard-shelled mussels and New Zealand green-lipped mussels have shown significant anti-inflammatory activity in animal models, but more research is needed to establish their therapeutic efficacy in humans. While green-lipped mussel supplements are widely used as a complementary therapy for arthritis patients, further investigations are necessary to determine their long-term benefits and safety. Therefore, the current evidence does not provide a definitive answer as to whether green-lipped mussel preparations improve the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis.",NEI
Does covid vaccination reduce the likelihood of getting long-lasting symptoms (long covid) in case of corona infection?,Yes,"Vaccination against COVID-19 has been shown to reduce the likelihood of experiencing long-lasting symptoms, often referred to as ""long COVID"". This is due to the vaccine's ability to stimulate an immune response, which can help attenuate the intensity of symptoms after infection. While the exact mechanisms are still under investigation, it is hypothesized that recurrent exposure to coronaviruses, including through vaccination, may induce an effective antiviral B and T-cell-mediated adaptive immune response. This response could potentially provide protection against COVID-19 and its long-term effects. However, it is important to note that while vaccination reduces the risk of long COVID, it does not eliminate it entirely.",Yes
Can the preventive intake of lysine prevent cold sores (lip herpes) and genital herpes? Can lysine help when the blisters are already there?,Yes,", with caveats

     Preventive intake of lysine has been suggested to prevent cold sores (herpes labialis) and genital herpes, as lysine appears to suppress the clinical manifestations of herpesvirus infection. L-lysine, an essential amino acid, has an inhibitory effect on the multiplication of herpes simplex virus in cell cultures, shortening the normal course and duration of the disease. However, the effectiveness of lysine supplementation for prophylaxis or treatment of herpes simplex lesions is dependent on maintaining adequate serum lysine levels, typically achieved with doses of 1 g/d or more, and may be more effective in conjunction with low-arginine diets. Longer duration controlled studies of daily lysine doses exceeding 1.2 g/d are required to definitively test its role in herpes simplex prophylaxis. The preventive intake of lysine has not been widely recognized by doctors for the prevention of herpes simplex recurrence. Once the blisters are already present, lysine has no effect on the rate of healing or on the appearance of the lesions at their worst.",NEI
"Do hormonal contraceptives to swallow (the ""pill"") affect endurance performance in women?",Yes,"Evidence suggests that hormonal contraceptives, specifically oral contraceptives, may influence endurance performance in women. The decrease in functional aerobic capacity, or VO(2)max, associated with oral contraceptive use can impact athletic performance, particularly in elite sportswomen. Although oral contraceptives may not significantly affect muscle strength, they can alter lipolytic activity under resting or exercise conditions. This can potentially affect lipid mobilization and energy availability during endurance activities. Furthermore, the hormonal content of oral contraceptives can influence blood volume, stroke volume, and cardiac output during exercise, which are crucial factors in endurance performance. However, the effects may vary depending on the specific formulation and dosage of the oral contraceptive, as well as individual factors such as race and genetic predisposition.",Yes
Does the pill affect the muscle strength of women??,No,"The available data suggests that oral contraceptive use does not significantly affect muscle strength in women. In a small study examining the androgenicity of the progestin in oral contraceptive pills and its effect on maximal leg strength in females, no significant association was found between the androgenicity of the progestin and maximal strength. Additionally, there were no significant changes in the concentration of endogenous oestradiol or progesterone or any measure of muscle strength between pill phases. In a larger study examining the effect of postmenopausal estrogen use on muscle strength, neuromuscular function, and the risk of falling, current estrogen users did not differ in a clinically meaningful way from those who had never used estrogen on tests of hip abductor strength, triceps extensor strength, or grip strength. These findings suggest that oral contraceptive use does not have a significant impact on muscle strength in women.",No
Does whole-body cryotherapy in the cold chamber improve health?,Yes,"Whole-body cryotherapy (WBC) has been reported to improve health outcomes in various medical fields, including motor organ issues, nervous system diseases, psychiatry, dermatology, and laryngology. The primary effect of WBC is the cooling of tissues, which has been shown to reduce pain effectively, particularly in the post-operative period after reconstructive surgery of the joints. WBC is also used in sports medicine to improve recovery from musculoskeletal trauma. Furthermore, WBC has been shown to have a positive effect on pain reduction and the recovery of various injuries. The therapy involves the application of extreme cold air to stimulate the body by means of intense hypothermia of virtually the entire body area, resulting in better postoperative pain control, improved early range of motion, and less postoperative bleeding and swelling. Therefore, it can be concluded that WBC in the cold chamber improves health.",NEI
Does transcranial pulse stimulation (TPS) improve mental performance in people with Alzheimer's dementia? Can the treatment improve the quality of life of those affected?,NEI,"The context provided does not contain any information on the effects of transcranial pulse stimulation (TPS) on mental performance or quality of life in individuals with Alzheimer's dementia. While the context discusses the potential benefits of other non-invasive brain stimulation techniques, such as transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), there is no mention of TPS. Therefore, there is insufficient information to determine whether TPS can improve mental performance or quality of life in individuals with Alzheimer's dementia. Further research is needed to evaluate the potential benefits of TPS in this population.",NEI
Can low-level laser therapy reduce pain from knee or hip osteoarthritis?,Yes,"Low-level laser therapy (LLLT) has been shown to offer promising symptomatic relief of osteoarthritic (OA) pain, including pain from knee and hip osteoarthritis. LLLT has been widely used to relieve pain caused by different musculoskeletal disorders, and has been reported to be successful in Russia and Eastern Europe. LLLT is thought to have an analgesic effect, as well as a biomodulatory effect on microcirculation, which may contribute to its effectiveness in reducing pain. Some studies have shown that LLLT has the ability to modulate inflammatory processes and relieve acute pain conditions. However, the laser therapy dose protocol has not yet been completely established, and further research is needed to determine the optimal treatment parameters for LLLT in the management of OA pain.",NEI
Can low-level laser therapy reduce wrist osteoarthritis pain?,Yes,"Low-level laser therapy (LLLT) has been reported to offer promising symptomatic relief of osteoarthritic (OA) pain, including that of the wrist. LLLT has been used for the non-surgical treatment of mild to moderate carpal tunnel syndrome, although its efficacy has been a long-standing controversy. However, evidence strongly supports that LLLT is an effective physical modality for the treatment of pain associated with various rheumatologic, neurologic, and musculoskeletal disorders, including OA. LLLT is thought to have an analgesic effect as well as a biomodulatory effect on microcirculation. A single diode laser irradiation of the synovial samples of patients with OA can statistically significantly alter the expression of some proteins in vitro. Therefore, it can be concluded that LLLT has the potential to reduce wrist OA pain. However, the laser therapy dose protocol has not been completely established, and more studies are needed to compare LLLT with other treatments and among different populations.",No

The context primarily focuses on the correlation between pre-existing comorbidities, such as hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease, and the severity of COVID-19. It also discusses the impact of COVID-19 on coagulation and the development of thromboembolic complications. However, the context does not address the role of blood type in the progression or outcome of COVID-19. Therefore, it is not possible to definitively answer the question based on the provided information. Further research or additional context would be required to provide a conclusive response.",NEI
"Do mouth rinses with hydroxyapatite, for example the products ""Linola sept mouth rinse"" and ""Karex Abwehr"", protect against SARS-CoV-2 infection?",Yes,"The context suggests that mouth rinses can significantly reduce virus infectivity and have potential benefits in reducing SARS-CoV-2 spread. Hydroxyapatite is a widely utilized component in dental hygiene agents, and it has been found that all mouth rinses tested inactivated SARS-CoV-2 viruses. Therefore, it can be inferred that mouth rinses containing hydroxyapatite, such as ""Linola sept mouth rinse"" and ""Karex Abwehr"", may offer protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, further research is needed to confirm the efficacy of specific hydroxyapatite-containing mouth rinses against SARS-CoV-2.",NEI
Does CBD (cannabidiol) relieve symptoms of mild to moderate covid-19 disease?,NEI,"(Not Enough Information)

At present, there is insufficient scientific evidence to definitively conclude whether Cannabidiol (CBD) relieves symptoms of mild to moderate COVID-19 disease. While CBD has been shown to exhibit significant efficacy in mental and inflammatory diseases, its potential as an antiviral or treatment for viral diseases, including COVID-19, has received limited attention and remains largely unexplored. Further research is needed to determine the potential therapeutic benefits of CBD in the context of COVID-19 and other viral infections.",No
Does CBD or cannabis use protect against covid-19 disease???,NEI,"(Not Enough Information)

Preliminary evidence suggests that cannabidiol (CBD) may be effective in the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders, but it has never been evaluated for the treatment of cognitive impairments associated with schizophrenia or COVID-19 disease. Cannabis use has been shown to have positive effects on cognition in patients with schizophrenia, but its impact on COVID-19 disease remains unclear. The use of cannabis does not seem to be associated with a negative effect on cognition in a representative sample of first-episode schizophrenia patients, but this does not necessarily mean that it has a protective effect against COVID-19 disease. Further research is needed to evaluate the potential benefits and risks of CBD or cannabis use in the context of COVID-19 disease.",NEI
Do sedatives and sleeping pills such as benzodiazepines and related substances increase the risk of Alzheimer's disease or other forms of dementia?,Yes,"Evidence from multiple observational studies indicates a significant association between benzodiazepine use and an increased risk of dementia. The odds of dementia were found to be 78% higher in those who used benzodiazepines compared to those who did not (odds ratio 1.78, 95% confidence interval 1.33-2.38). Furthermore, long-term use and use of long-acting benzodiazepines were strongly associated with an increased risk of dementia. Although there have been concerns regarding protopathic bias in these studies, the association between benzodiazepine use and dementia incidence is not purely an artefact due to this bias. The use of benzodiazepines is highly prevalent in elderly and late middle-aged populations, and their use may be associated with an increased risk of dementia. However, it should be noted that there is currently no evidence that benzodiazepine or anticholinergic drug use is associated with typical pathological features of Alzheimer's disease.",NEI
"Does taking polyunsaturated fatty acids, such as omega-3 and omega-6, reduce ADHD symptoms in children?",Yes,"Scientific evidence suggests that supplementation with long-chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, such as eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), may have beneficial effects on behavioral symptoms and cognitive impairments in children diagnosed with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Research studies have reported abnormal plasma fatty acid profiles in children with ADHD, and suboptimal omega-3 levels may contribute to the disorder and related developmental problems. Supplementation with an omega-3 fatty acid mix has been shown to increase EPA and DHA concentrations in erythrocyte membranes and improve working memory function in children with ADHD. However, it is currently unclear whether omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids are related to ADHD pathology or to associated behaviors. Further research is needed to confirm the potential benefits of dietary supplementation with omega-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids for ADHD and related conditions.",No
Do infusions of vitamin C relieve symptoms of chronic fatigue or long covid?,NEI,"Justification: The available context discusses the effects of vitamin C on the common cold, post-operative fatigue, and chemotherapy-related fatigue. However, it does not provide sufficient information regarding the impact of vitamin C infusions on symptoms of chronic fatigue or long COVID. While vitamin C has been shown to reduce fatigue in certain contexts, its specific effects on chronic fatigue or long COVID have not been established in the provided information. Therefore, it is not possible to definitively answer the question based solely on the given context. Further research is needed to determine the efficacy of vitamin C infusions in relieving symptoms of chronic fatigue or long COVID.",NEI
Does taking probiotics shorten the duration of acute infectious diarrhea?,Yes,"Evidence from multiple studies suggests that probiotics can indeed shorten the duration of acute infectious diarrhea. A meta-analysis of 15 studies found that probiotics reduced the risk of diarrhea at 3 days, while another analysis of 12 studies reported a mean reduction in diarrhea duration of 30.48 hours. The beneficial effects of probiotics in acute infectious diarrhea have been observed primarily in watery diarrhea and viral gastroenteritis, and they appear to be a useful adjunct to rehydration therapy in both adults and children. Additionally, clinical trials have shown potential beneficial effects of probiotics in preventing and treating antibiotic-associated diarrhea, rotavirus-induced diarrhea, traveler's diarrhea, and diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome. The role of probiotics in treating or preventing diarrheal diseases is well established, with numerous probiotic agents being studied for the management of diarrheal disease.",No
Does high-dose vitamin D slow down the course of disease in multiple sclerosis (MS)?,NEI,"(Not Enough Information)

There is evidence suggesting a protective association between higher vitamin D levels and the onset of multiple sclerosis (MS). However, the role of vitamin D in modulating the clinical course of MS has been little studied, and its therapeutic potential in established MS has not been fully explored. While observational studies have suggested that high-dose vitamin D may reduce inflammation in relapsing-remitting MS, this has not been clearly confirmed in randomized controlled trials. Furthermore, there is uncertainty about the optimal dose and form of vitamin D to be used. Therefore, based on the available evidence, it is not possible to definitively conclude whether high-dose vitamin D slows down the course of disease in MS.",NEI
Does taking taiga root extract strengthen the immune system? Can it make vaccinations more effective or tolerable?,NEI,"The context provided does not contain specific information regarding the effects of Taiga root extract on the immune system or its potential interaction with vaccinations. Therefore, it is not possible to definitively answer this question based solely on the given context.

However, the context does indicate that certain substances, such as probiotics and adjuvants, can enhance immune responses to vaccines and improve the function of the immune system related to defense against infections. It also mentions that toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists, which are frequently studied for their role as vaccine adjuvants, can enhance the initiation of immune responses to antigens by activating dendritic cells.

Further research would be needed to determine if Taiga root extract has similar properties or if it could potentially interact with vaccinations in a beneficial way.",NEI
"Can ozone therapy, in which autologous blood is treated with ozone and recycled, favorably influence the course of COVID-19 disease?",NEI,"The context provided does not contain direct information regarding the influence of ozone therapy on COVID-19 disease. However, it does indicate that ozone therapy has been reported to have therapeutic effects in various pathological conditions, including infectious disorders. Ozone therapy can activate the antioxidant system and improve blood circulation and oxygen delivery to tissue. It has been shown to improve prothrombin time and red blood cell deformability, which could potentially be beneficial in managing certain aspects of infectious diseases. Nevertheless, without specific studies on the effects of ozone therapy on COVID-19, it is not possible to definitively state whether it can favorably influence the course of the disease. Therefore, there is not enough information to provide a definitive answer.",NEI
Does dimenhydrinate relieve travel nausea better than a placebo?,Yes,"Dimenhydrinate, an over-the-counter antihistamine, has demonstrated efficacy in relieving nausea and motion sickness. In a prospective, randomized, double-blind study, dimenhydrinate was found to be more effective than a placebo in preventing post-operative nausea and vomiting (PONV), with 38.8% of patients in the dimenhydrinate group remaining completely free from PONV compared to 15.1% in the placebo group (p = 0.004). Although the context does not specifically mention travel nausea, the use of dimenhydrinate as an anti-emetic during anesthesia and its efficacy in preventing PONV suggest that it may also be effective in relieving travel nausea. Additionally, the medical use of dimenhydrinate for the prevention of nausea and motion sickness further supports this conclusion. Therefore, based on the available evidence, it can be inferred that dimenhydrinate relieves travel nausea better than a placebo.",NEI
Does dimenhydrinate relieve travel nausea as well as the proven drug scopolamine???,No,"Dimenhydrinate has been demonstrated to be effective in preventing post-operative nausea and vomiting, with a statistically significant number of patients remaining free from symptoms compared to placebo (p = 0.004). However, when the efficacy of transdermal scopolamine and oral dimenhydrinate were compared with placebo, scopolamine provided protection against motion sickness at a significantly higher level of significance (p = 0.0001) than dimenhydrinate (p = 0.05). Therefore, based on the available evidence, it can be concluded that dimenhydrinate does not relieve travel nausea as well as the proven drug scopolamine.",NEI
Does short-term fasting improve quality of life in cancer?,Yes,"Evidence suggests that short-term fasting may improve quality of life in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. Preclinical data and a small number of clinical studies indicate that repeated short-term fasting can reduce the side effects of chemotherapy, such as fatigue, weakness, and gastrointestinal symptoms. Fasting has been shown to enhance the efficacy of chemotherapy by sensitizing cancer cells and protecting normal cells in various cancer models. Additionally, fasting potentially improves the response of tumor cells to chemotherapy by repairing DNA damage in normal tissues, upregulating autophagy flux, altering apoptosis, and depleting regulatory T cells. However, more data from larger randomized trials is needed to fully understand the effects of short-term fasting on quality of life, reduction of side effects during chemotherapy, and a possible reduction of tumor progression.",NEI
Does short-term fasting reduce the side effects of chemotherapy for cancer???,Yes,"Scientific evidence suggests that short-term fasting can indeed reduce the side effects of chemotherapy in cancer patients. Preclinical data indicates that short-term fasting protects healthy cells against the side effects of chemotherapy and increases the vulnerability of cancer cells to it. This is due to a phenomenon known as differential stress resistance. Clinical studies have shown that patients who fasted in combination with chemotherapy reported a reduction in a wide range of side effects, including fatigue, weakness, and gastrointestinal side effects. Furthermore, fasting before or during chemotherapy may induce differential stress resistance, reducing the adverse effects of chemotherapy and enhancing the efficacy of drugs. It is suggested that fasting may also augment the efficacy of oncolytic viral therapy. The potential benefits of fasting in combination with chemotherapy include reducing tumor progression and increasing the effectiveness of chemotherapy.",NEI

Can zinc mitigate the progression of Covid-19?,NEI,"The available evidence suggests a potential role for zinc in reducing the risk, duration, and severity of SARS-CoV-2 infections, particularly in populations at risk of zinc deficiency. This study provides the first in vivo evidence that zinc sulphate may have a role in the therapeutic management of COVID-19. However, it is important to note that direct evidence to determine the effectiveness of zinc for either prevention or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 is still pending. While COVID-19 patients with zinc deficiency were found to have significantly lower zinc levels compared to healthy controls, the clinical significance of serum zinc levels in COVID-19 patients remains unknown. More randomized studies are needed to evaluate the value of adding zinc to other therapies for COVID-19. Therefore, based on the current evidence, it is not possible to definitively state whether zinc can mitigate the progression of COVID-19.",No
Does zinc preventively protect against covid-19 disease???,NEI,"(Not Enough Information)

Elaboration: The available evidence suggests that zinc may potentially reduce the risk, duration, and severity of SARS-CoV-2 infections, particularly for populations at risk of zinc deficiency. Zinc is a trace element with potent immunoregulatory and antiviral properties, and its deficiency has been associated with impairment of immune system function. However, direct evidence to determine if zinc is effective for either prevention or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 is still pending. While zinc supplementation has been hypothesized to be useful for prevention or treatment of COVID-19, more randomized studies are needed to evaluate the value of adding zinc to other therapies for COVID-19. Therefore, it is not possible to definitively conclude whether zinc has a preventive effect against COVID-19 disease based on the available evidence.",NEI

Further research is needed to determine the efficacy of these herbal remedies in preventing recurrent cystitis.",No
Do herbal remedies with nasturtium and horseradish alleviate the symptoms of cystitis as well as an antibiotic???,NEI,"The context does not provide direct information on the effectiveness of herbal remedies containing nasturtium and horseradish in alleviating cystitis symptoms compared to antibiotics. However, it does mention that a licensed native preparation of nasturtium and horseradish is used for the treatment of upper respiratory and urinary tract infections, and that these herbal medicines relieve dysmenorrhea symptoms likely through inhibition of cyclooxygenase activity. Additionally, the context discusses the diuretic effects of various herbal medicines, including rosmarinus officinalis l. and centaurium erythraea l., which are reputed for the treatment of urinary ailments. The study demonstrates a diuretic effect of aqueous extracts of r. officinalis l. and c. erythraea l. with the most effective dose for water and electrolyte excretion being 8% for both plants. The context also mentions that herbs can be used preventatively, to aid treatment, and to ease the symptoms of urinary tract infections (UTIs). However, the context does not directly compare the effectiveness of these herbal remedies to antibiotics in treating cystitis. Therefore, it is not possible to definitively answer the question based on the provided context.",NEI
Does mistletoe therapy help against cancer or can it improve the quality of life of cancer patients?,Yes,"Mistletoe therapy has been shown to improve the quality of life of cancer patients in several clinical studies, particularly in those undergoing chemotherapy. The extracts of mistletoe have been reported to stimulate the immune system and have antitumor and immunomodulatory properties. In patients with locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic carcinoma, mistletoe treatment significantly improved the quality of life compared to best supportive care alone. Systematic reviews of mistletoe therapy trials in cancer have shown promising results in improving patients' quality of life during chemotherapy and reducing fatigue. However, the clinical efficacy of mistletoe in cancer and associated survival benefits remain contested, and further evaluation is needed to determine its effects on health-related quality of life and tumor growth inhibition. Nonetheless, mistletoe therapy has been used as a complementary anticancer treatment for approximately 100 years and has been shown to have a positive impact on the quality of life of cancer patients.",NEI
Can homeopathic remedies prevent colds in children?,No,"The context suggests that homeopathic remedies, such as a specific cold syrup, have been studied for their effectiveness in reducing the severity of cold symptoms in young children. However, this does not imply that homeopathic remedies can prevent colds in children. The study only demonstrated a reduction in symptom severity in the first day after beginning treatment, not a preventative effect. Furthermore, the context indicates that there is little evidence for the efficacy of any therapy for treating common cold symptoms in children under six years of age, and it is unlikely that studies will be conducted to establish efficacy. Therefore, based on the provided context, it cannot be concluded that homeopathic remedies can prevent colds in children.",No
Can homeopathic remedies relieve colds in children??,NEI,"The efficacy of homeopathic remedies for relieving cold symptoms in children remains inconclusive based on the available information. While some studies suggest that homeopathic syrups and complexes may have anti-inflammatory and pain-relieving qualities, there is insufficient evidence to definitively establish their superiority over placebo in improving the quality of life of children with mild to moderate asthma or upper respiratory tract infections. Furthermore, the lack of convincing demonstration of efficacy for any therapy in treating common cold symptoms in children under six years of age underscores the need for more rigorous research in this area. It is essential to consider the potential benefits and risks of homeopathic remedies alongside conventional treatments when addressing cold symptoms in children.",No
Do agents containing uridine and/or cytidine improve the symptoms of polyneuropathy?,Yes,"The combination of uridine, cytidine, and vitamin B12 has been reported to be safe and effective in the treatment of neuralgias arising from neural compression associated with degenerative orthopedic alterations and trauma. Uridine, a pyrimidine nucleoside, has been proposed as a potential supplement in the treatment of psychosis based on its ability to reduce haloperidol-induced dopamine release. Uridine has also been prescribed for the treatment of neuromuscular affections in humans. Disorders of pyrimidine metabolism, including those that involve an alteration in uridine metabolism, have neurological and systemic effects. Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy is an autoimmune peripheral neuropathy and would be expected to benefit from corticosteroids. Numerous medications and toxins are implicated with neuropathy, but objective proof is lacking for many. Therefore, it can be inferred that agents containing uridine and/or cytidine may improve the symptoms of polyneuropathy.",NEI
Can treatments with ultrasound relieve the pain of osteoarthritis?,Yes,"Therapeutic ultrasound has been employed in the treatment of osteoarthritis to alleviate symptoms and enhance functional status. Recent high-level evidence supports the use of therapeutic ultrasound for reducing pain in individuals with knee osteoarthritis. The application of therapeutic ultrasound, in accordance with established parameters, is recommended for the treatment of knee osteoarthritis, as it significantly decreases pain intensity after the fifth session, with the reduction maintained until the end of the intervention. The use of therapeutic ultrasound is one of several physical therapy modalities suggested for managing pain and loss of function due to osteoarthritis. Pain and range of motion appear to improve following ultrasound treatment in acute periarticular inflammatory conditions and osteoarthritis. Furthermore, the addition of therapeutic ultrasound to traditional physical therapy has demonstrated a longitudinal positive effect on pain, functional status, and physical quality of life in patients with hip osteoarthritis. Ultrasound is commonly used to treat knee osteoarthritis, providing unique advantages in relieving pain, inflammation, and delaying cartilage degeneration. The underlying mechanisms of ultrasound for the treatment of knee osteoarthritis may involve inhibition of the expression of VEGF in the synovium, synovial fluid, and cartilage.",NEI
Does regular exercise reduce the severity and duration of colds and other respiratory infections?,Yes,"Regular, moderate-intensity exercise has been shown to enhance immune function and reduce the occurrence, severity, and duration of acute respiratory infections, including the common cold. This is supported by a meta-analysis which found that regular moderate exercise reduces the risk of infection compared with a sedentary lifestyle. However, it is important to note that very prolonged bouts of exercise and periods of intensified training are associated with increased infection risk. The anti-inflammatory effects and improved immune effector functions resulting from regular moderate exercise contribute to reduced disease incidence and viral infection susceptibility. Therefore, regular, moderate exercise can be considered an effective complementary treatment for many chronic diseases and a beneficial preventative measure against the common cold.",Yes
Can regular exercise prevent you from getting a cold or other respiratory infections???,Yes,", with caveats

Regular, moderate-intensity exercise has been found to increase immunity and potentially prevent the common cold, as well as reduce the risk of upper respiratory tract infections. However, it is important to note that unusually heavy acute or chronic exercise could have the opposite effect, increasing the risk of upper respiratory tract infections. Strenuous exercise has been associated with immune-suppression and consequently, an increased risk of infections, especially at the upper respiratory tract. In athletes, a common observation is that symptoms of respiratory infection cluster around competitions, and even minor illnesses such as colds can impair exercise performance. It is also worth noting that intense exercise may reduce healthy athletes' immunity or open the door to serious illness in athletes who already have a cold. Therefore, while regular exercise can have a positive impact on preventing colds and other respiratory infections, it is important to maintain a moderate intensity and avoid overexertion.",No
"Can cold showers, cold baths or cold water treading according to Kneipp prevent colds and respiratory infections in adults?",NEI,"(Not Enough Information)

While the context provides evidence supporting the use of cold water for cooling the body, it does not provide sufficient information to conclude whether cold showers, cold baths, or cold water treading according to Kneipp can prevent colds and respiratory infections in adults. The context discusses the use of cold water for treating exertional heatstroke and preventing environmental cold injuries, but it does not address the prevention of colds and respiratory infections. Therefore, further research is needed to determine the effectiveness of these methods in preventing colds and respiratory infections in adults.",NEI
"Can the Wim Hof method - consisting of breathing training, meditation and acclimatization to cold - strengthen the immune system of healthy people and thus prevent infectious diseases?",NEI,"The Wim Hof method, involving breathing training, meditation, and acclimatization to cold, may have potential immune-boosting effects for healthy individuals, but definitive evidence is currently lacking. The concept of hormesis, which involves achieving health benefits through exposure to mild stress, has been applied successfully to humans. Heat acclimation and forced water intake have improved human endurance in hot environments, while whole-body hyperthermia (WBH) has shown potential in cancer treatment by activating the immune system. However, the effects of the Wim Hof method on the immune system and its ability to prevent infectious diseases remain unclear. Further research is needed to establish a clear link between the Wim Hof method and immune system enhancement in healthy individuals.",NEI
Do saw palmetto preparations improve the symptoms of benign enlarged prostate (benign prostatic hyperplasia) in the longer term compared to placebo?,NEI,"The efficacy of saw palmetto in improving symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) in the long term is not conclusively established compared to placebo. While several studies and meta-analyses suggest that saw palmetto may lead to subjective and objective improvement in men with lower urinary tract symptoms, recent clinical trials have questioned its efficacy, particularly at standard doses. In a randomized clinical trial involving 225 men with moderate-to-severe BPH symptoms, saw palmetto extract (160 mg twice daily) did not improve symptoms or objective measures of BPH compared to placebo over a 1-year period. Therefore, further research is needed to establish the long-term efficacy of saw palmetto in treating BPH symptoms.",No
Does honey help against acute cough in children?,Yes,"Evidence suggests that honey is an effective remedy for acute cough in children. A short-cut review established that honey provides significant symptom relief for cough in children with an upper respiratory tract infection. The World Health Organization identifies honey as a potential demulcent treatment for cough, and the Australian guidelines recommend honey for non-specific acute paediatric cough. Clinical trials have shown that honey decreases the severity and frequency of cough, improves the quality of sleep for both parents and children, and does not have side effects. Additionally, honey has been shown to be more effective than no treatment in reducing the frequency of cough, bothersome cough, and improving sleep quality in children. The results suggest that honey may provide better cough relief than DPH in children and improve the sleep quality of children and their parents.",Yes
Can Artemisia tea cure malaria as well as drugs?,No,"Artemisia annua tea has been shown to be an effective treatment for malaria in various clinical trials, with artemisinin plasma concentrations after intake of the tea sufficient for clinical effects. However, these concentrations are insufficient to recommend such preparations as equivalent substitutes for modern artemisinin drugs in malaria therapy. The traditional use of the medicinal plant Artemisia annua for the treatment of malaria entails the preparation of a tea infusion, but this has not been investigated in vitro to determine its efficacy compared to pure artemisinin. While Artemisia annua tea infusions have shown synergism with artemisinin against Plasmodium falciparum, it is unclear if the flavonoids present in the plant are also extracted into the tea infusion. Therefore, it cannot be concluded that Artemisia tea can cure malaria as well as drugs.",NEI
Does thyme help against cough?,Yes,"Thyme extract has been observed to possess significant anti-inflammatory properties by reducing NF-κB p65 and NF-κB p52 transcription factors protein levels, followed by a decrease in pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1 beta and IL-8), and muc5ac secretion in human normal bronchial and tracheal epithelial cells. Thyme (Thymus vulgaris) is traditionally used to prepare herbal remedies possessing expectorant, mucolytic, antitussive, and antispasmodic properties. The antispasmodic activity of thyme extracts is attributed to the synergistic effects of phenolic volatile oil compounds and the flavone luteolin. Therefore, thyme extract might be an effective treatment for cough, especially when hypersecretion of mucus overwhelms the ciliary clearance and obstructs airways, causing morbidity and mortality.",NEI
Does coenzyme Q10 relieve muscle discomfort during treatment with statins?,Yes,"Evidence suggests that coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) supplementation has the potential to relieve muscle discomfort during treatment with statins. Studies have demonstrated that CoQ10 supplementation effectively reduced statin-related mild-to-moderate muscular symptoms, leading to lower interference with daily activities. A six-month administration of CoQ10 resulted in a statistically significant decrease in muscle pain and sensitivity. Compared with placebo, CoQ10 supplementation ameliorated statin-associated muscle symptoms, such as muscle pain, weakness, cramps, and tiredness. CoQ10 deficiency has been associated with statin-induced myopathy, and supplementation with CoQ10 may reduce inflammation markers. Therefore, CoQ10 supplementation may be considered a complementary approach to manage statin-induced myopathy.",NEI
Does Chaga mushroom help against cancer or other diseases?,Yes,"The Chaga mushroom (Inonotus obliquus) has been found to exhibit potential anticancer properties, primarily due to its ability to prevent the inhibition of gap junctional intercellular communication (GJIC) through the inactivation of ERK1/2 and p38 MAP kinase. This mechanism suggests that Chaga mushroom extracts may act as natural anticancer products. Additionally, the Chaga mushroom has been traditionally used in folk medicine to treat various disorders, including cancers and digestive diseases, due to its numerous biological functions such as antibacterial, antiallergic, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant activities. Recent epidemiological studies have also suggested that mushrooms, including Chaga, may prevent against different types of cancers. Furthermore, Chaga mushroom extracts have been evaluated for their potential to protect against oxidative damage to DNA in human lymphocytes. Overall, the Chaga mushroom has shown promise as a therapeutic agent in addressing the pathogenesis of cancer and other diseases. However, more research is needed to fully understand its therapeutic effects and mechanisms of action.",NEI
"Can filtering out blue light using blue filter glasses or night mode settings on smartphone, tablet or laptop screens have a beneficial effect on sleep?",Yes,"Justification: The findings suggest that blocking the short-wavelength component of blue light, emitted by smartphones and other electronic devices, has a beneficial effect on human sleep. This is primarily due to the prevention of light-induced melatonin suppression, which is a broadly used indirect assessment of the circadian clock sensitivity. The use of blue-blocking glasses or night mode settings on electronic devices can mitigate the negative effects of blue light exposure, such as decreased sleepiness and confusion-bewilderment, as well as increased commission errors. Furthermore, a nocturnal blue light blocking intervention has been shown to improve processing speed and working memory among individuals with insomnia symptoms. These findings support the hypothesis that filtering out blue light can have a beneficial effect on sleep.",No
Is strophanthin an effective cardiovascular drug?,NEI,"The context does not provide direct evidence on the effectiveness of strophanthin as a cardiovascular drug. However, it does mention strophalloside, a cardenolide isolated from Antiaris toxicaria, which has been shown to exhibit potential as an anticancer drug by reducing cell viability, inhibiting cell growth, and suppressing cell migration and invasion in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Strophanthin and strophalloside are related compounds, as strophanthin is a cardiac glycoside derived from plants like Strophanthus gratus and Strophanthus hispidus. Given the context, it is not possible to definitively state whether strophanthin is an effective cardiovascular drug. Further research and evidence are needed to establish its efficacy in treating cardiovascular diseases.",NEI
Can regular intake of vitamin C prevent colds?,No,"The analysis of multiple studies indicates that regular intake of vitamin C does not prevent the occurrence of the common cold in the general population. This conclusion is supported by the lack of a considerable decrease in the incidence of colds in vitamin C-supplemented groups compared to placebo groups. However, it is important to note that vitamin C has been shown to consistently reduce the duration and severity of cold symptoms. The combination of regular vitamin C supplementation with additional doses during illness has been demonstrated to decrease the disability caused by colds and other winter illnesses. Nevertheless, the evidence does not support the claim that regular intake of vitamin C prevents colds.",No
Can taking vitamin C after the onset of a cold relieve symptoms or shorten the illness?,Yes,"Evidence suggests that taking vitamin C after the onset of a cold can indeed relieve symptoms and shorten the illness. Placebo-controlled trials have shown that vitamin C supplementation decreases the duration and severity of common cold infections. Regular daily supplementation of vitamin C, combined with extra dosage at the time of illness, has been shown to reduce the disability due to common colds and other winter illnesses. In children, 1 to 2 g/day of vitamin C has been found to shorten colds by 18%. Current evidence indicates that oral intake of vitamin C may assist with symptoms of acute viral respiratory infections by reducing fever and chills, relieving chest pain, and assisting in reducing symptoms of common cold-induced asthma. In each of the 21 studies analyzed, vitamin C reduced the duration of episodes and the severity of the symptoms of the common cold by an average of 23%. It is conceivable that therapeutic supplementation starting early at the onset of the cold episode could produce comparable benefits. Therefore, it may be worthwhile for common cold patients to test on an individual basis whether therapeutic vitamin C is beneficial for them.",No
Do saline nasal rinses and nasal sprays or inhaling with steam from saline solution help with colds?,Yes,"Evidence supports the use of saline nasal rinses and nasal sprays as well as inhaling steam from saline solution to help alleviate symptoms associated with the common cold. Theoretically, steam may aid in the drainage of congested mucus and potentially destroy the cold virus, as it does in vitro. Studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of large particle vapor treatment and saline solution irrigation in reducing inflammatory mediators in nasal secretions. Furthermore, there is evidence that saline is beneficial in treating the symptoms of chronic rhinosinusitis, and increasing studies show that nasal irrigation with hypertonic saline is more effective than traditional saline in treating rhinosinusitis. Three studies have found benefits of steam for symptom relief with the common cold, with odds ratios and relative risks favoring steam inhalation. However, less conclusive evidence supports the use of spray and liquid saline nasal irrigation for managing symptoms of mild to moderate allergic rhinitis and acute upper respiratory tract infections.",NEI
Do remedies with ginseng help with erectile dysfunction?,Yes,"Scientific evidence supports the claim that remedies with ginseng can help with erectile dysfunction. The therapeutic efficacy of tissue-cultured mountain ginseng extract (tmge) on male patients with erectile dysfunction (ED) was found to be 60%, significantly higher than the 30% efficacy observed in placebo and trazodone treated groups (p < 0.05). Ginseng, particularly Korean red ginseng (krg; Panax ginseng), has been promoted as an alternative treatment for ED, with ginsenosides being the principal active ingredients. These compounds have been shown to facilitate penile erection by directly inducing the vasodilation and relaxation of the penile corpus cavernosum. Animal studies have also provided increasing evidence for the role of nitric oxide in the mechanism of ginsenoside action. Furthermore, both Asian and American forms of ginseng have been found to enhance libido and copulatory performance in laboratory animals. While more research is needed to fully understand the potential benefits and limitations of ginseng for ED treatment, current evidence suggests that it may be an effective alternative to traditional drugs.",No
Can taking spermidine prolong life? Can it prevent diseases?,Yes,"Evidence suggests that spermidine, a naturally occurring polyamine compound, can extend lifespan and promote health across various species. Exogenous administration of spermidine has been shown to prolong the lifespan of model organisms such as yeast, nematodes, flies, and mice. In humans, high levels of dietary spermidine have been associated with reduced blood pressure and a lower incidence of cardiovascular disease. Spermidine has also been implicated in reducing age-related oxidative protein damage in mice and exerting cardioprotective effects, including reducing cardiac hypertrophy and preserving diastolic function in old mice. Recent studies have further suggested that higher spermidine intake might be a promising dietary approach to preserve brain health in older adults. Spermidine's anti-aging properties are believed to stem from its ability to induce autophagy, a cellular process that helps maintain cellular homeostasis and protect against various diseases, including heart diastolic function, myopathic defects, and neurodegenerative disorders. Therefore, it can be concluded that spermidine has the potential to prolong life and prevent diseases.",NEI
Can capsules or tablets with lactase improve the symptoms of lactose intolerance and make dairy products more tolerable?,Yes,"Scientific evidence supports the claim that capsules or tablets containing lactase can improve the symptoms of lactose intolerance and increase tolerance to dairy products. Studies have shown that administering lactase supplements, such as lactogest, lactaid, and dairyease, can enhance lactose digestion and reduce symptoms like excess gas production, abdominal pain, diarrhea, or nausea. The combined administration of freeze-dried yogurt cultures and acid lactase has been found to increase lactose digestion more than either component alone, benefiting a larger number of lactose malabsorbers. Microbial-derived beta-galactosidase enzyme preparations have also been shown to improve in vivo lactose digestion and tolerance through enhanced gastrointestinal digestion of lactose. Consequently, lactase supplements can be an effective strategy for managing lactose intolerance and improving tolerance to dairy products.",Yes
Can weighted blankets help with sleep disorders?,Yes,", with caveats.

Scientific evidence suggests that weighted blankets may have a role in improving sleep-related symptoms, particularly in specific populations. The use of weighted blankets has been shown to result in significantly better sleep maintenance and a higher daytime activity level. Furthermore, these blankets have been found to reduce daytime symptoms of fatigue, depression, and anxiety. Notably, weighted chain blankets have been identified as an effective and safe intervention for insomnia in patients with major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. However, it is important to acknowledge that the research on the effectiveness of weighted blankets in reducing insomnia is sparse, and more studies are needed to establish guidelines for their use in clinical practice. Therefore, while weighted blankets may be beneficial in certain contexts, their overall efficacy in treating sleep disorders requires further investigation.",NEI
Does the drug remdesivir prevent COVID-19 deaths?,NEI,"The context suggests that remdesivir has been associated with accelerated recovery of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and may result in a small reduction in mortality. However, it is not explicitly stated that remdesivir prevents COVID-19 deaths. The context mentions that remdesivir improves recovery and reduces serious adverse events, but the extent to which it prevents deaths is not conclusively determined. Therefore, there is not enough information to definitively answer whether remdesivir prevents COVID-19 deaths.",No
Does magnetic resonance therapy improve complaints of knee osteoarthritis or herniated discs (e.g. pain)?,No,"Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a valuable diagnostic tool for augmenting the process of evaluating disorders of the knee, such as meniscal and ligamentous injuries, and for demonstrating degenerative disc disease, disc herniations, and other abnormalities not amenable to diagnosis by other techniques. However, the value of MRI in improving patient outcomes, such as complaints of knee osteoarthritis or herniated discs, is controversial. The evidence suggests that MRI allows for accurate diagnosis, but it does not support the routine use of MRI for the evaluation and management of meniscal tears in patients with osteoarthritis of the knee. Furthermore, the study shows that MRI is not a reliable predictor of improvements in pain after nonoperative treatment of patients with knee osteoarthritis. Therefore, it can be concluded that magnetic resonance therapy does not improve complaints of knee osteoarthritis or herniated discs.",No
Are oral zinc supplements effective for treating a cold (chill)?,Yes,"Oral zinc supplements have been shown to be effective for treating a cold, as they are associated with a shorter duration and reduced severity of symptoms. Biochemical evidence suggests that zinc may be an effective treatment for the common cold, and clinical studies have demonstrated that ionic zinc dissolved in the mouth can significantly shorten the manifestations of the common cold. Controlled clinical trials have shown that zinc gluconate glycine lozenges can reduce symptom severity and duration of symptoms in patients with the common cold. Oral zinc supplementation has been shown to reduce the duration of the common cold by up to 35%, depending on the dose used. However, it is important to note that the use of intranasal zinc is strongly associated with anosmia, or the loss of the sense of smell, in humans. Therefore, it is recommended that oral zinc supplements be used instead of intranasal zinc for the treatment of the common cold.",Yes
Do oral zinc supplements prevent a cold???,Yes,"Oral zinc supplementation has been shown to have a preventive effect on the common cold, particularly in children. The use of oral zinc prophylactically is associated with a reduced incidence of colds. Additionally, when initiated within 24 hours of symptom onset, oral zinc is associated with a shorter duration of the common cold in healthy people. The mechanism by which zinc exerts its effects on the common cold is not fully understood, but clinical studies have shown that ionic zinc (Zn2+) dissolved in the mouth can significantly shorten the manifestations of the common cold. While the results of studies on the effects of oral zinc supplementation on the severity of the common cold are mixed, it is widely believed that oral zinc supplementation can reduce the effects of the common cold. It is important to note that intranasal zinc gluconate gel treatment for this purpose has been strongly associated with anosmia, or the loss of the sense of smell, in humans. Therefore, it is recommended to use oral zinc supplementation for the prevention and treatment of the common cold.",NEI
Is colloidal gold good for health?,Yes,", with caveats.

Justification: Colloidal gold, a solution comprised of nanoparticles of Au(0), has been utilized in medicinal applications for centuries due to its recognized bacteriostatic, anticorrosive, and antioxidative properties. Modern medicine routinely employs gold in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and cancer, as well as an adjuvant and carrier in the vaccine field. Gold nanoparticles, specifically, have garnered significant attention for their potential use as inert carriers for medical purposes and their ability to localize in tumors, subsequently being excreted through the urinary system. However, it is important to note that Au(CN)2(-) produced locally may facilitate the cellular uptake and hence the therapeutic and toxic effects of gold drugs. Additionally, gold released from dental restorations has been reported to increase the risk of developing gold hypersensitivity. While there is evidence supporting the potential health benefits of colloidal gold, further research is needed to fully understand its implications and potential risks.",NEI

Are heavy (ex-)smokers less likely to die of lung cancer if they regularly participate in lung cancer screening by computed tomography (CT)?,Yes,"Justification: The National Lung Screening Trial demonstrated a significant reduction in lung cancer-specific mortality in high-risk current and former smokers who underwent annual low-dose chest computed tomography (CT) screening. This subset of smokers, defined by a smoking history of more than 30 pack-years and an age range of 55-74 years, experienced a decrease in lung cancer mortality compared to those who did not undergo screening. Furthermore, recent guidelines recommend chest CT for smokers based on studies of individuals aged 55 to 74 years with 30-pack year smoking history to detect lung cancers. The preliminary results of the randomized controlled National Lung Screening Trial confirmed that lung cancer screening by CT is associated with a reduction in lung cancer mortality (20.3%) and in all-cause mortality (7%) compared with a control group undergoing chest X-ray at the same time intervals. Therefore, it can be concluded that heavy (ex-)smokers are less likely to die of lung cancer if they regularly participate in lung cancer screening by computed tomography (CT).",Yes
Can lung cancer screening by computed tomography (CT) also do harm???,Yes,"Lung cancer screening by computed tomography (CT) can indeed have potential harms. One of the main concerns is overdiagnosis, which may lead to unnecessary treatments and associated complications. False-positive results are also a significant issue, as they can cause anxiety and prompt further invasive procedures, such as biopsies, for benign nodules. The cumulative radiation exposure from repeated CT scans, although relatively low, is another point of concern. Additionally, the economic, psychosocial, and physical burdens resulting from these procedures warrant further investigation. Therefore, while CT screening can be beneficial in detecting lung cancer at earlier stages and reducing lung cancer-specific mortality, it is essential to acknowledge and address these potential harms.",Yes

Does gargling with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) help against coronavirus or others in throat infections?,No,"In the context of viral infections, including SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses, there is currently no scientific evidence to support the use of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) mouthwash for controlling viral load. Despite the widespread dissemination of the indication for preoperative mouthwash containing 1% H2O2 to reduce the viral load of SARS-CoV-2 in saliva prior to oral procedures, this has not been substantiated by research. While H2O2 has been shown to have anti-bacterial properties and a role in host-microbial interactions, its virucidal effect is not established. Furthermore, the peroxidase-halide-H2O2 system, which may contribute to host defense against certain viral infections, is not proven to be effective against SARS-CoV-2 or other viruses in the context of throat infections. Therefore, gargling with H2O2 is not recommended for the prevention or treatment of coronavirus or other throat infections.",NEI
Does gargling with hydrogen peroxide have health risks?,Yes,"Justification: Gargling with hydrogen peroxide does have associated health risks. While it is true that hydrogen peroxide can be used in low concentrations for self-administered oral health care products such as dentifrices and mouthrinses, caution should be exercised. Hydrogen peroxide is a highly reactive substance and can damage oral soft tissues and hard tissues when present in high concentrations and with prolonged exposure. Ingestion of hydrogen peroxide can result in morbidity through direct caustic injury, oxygen gas formation, and lipid peroxidation. There have been reported cases of fatal oxygen embolism in children after ingestion of hydrogen peroxide. Concerns regarding hydrogen peroxide carcinogenicity arise from its ability to act as a strong oxidizing agent. Therefore, it is not recommended to consider hydrogen peroxide as innocuous, and it should not be ingested or used in situations where the evolved oxygen gas cannot dissipate freely.",NEI
Can vitamin C prevent infection with coronavirus or prevent deaths from covid-19?,NEI,"The evidence to date indicates that oral vitamin C (2-8 g/day) may reduce the incidence and duration of respiratory infections.

Does vitamin D mitigate the course of Covid 19 disease?,NEI,"Justification: The protective role of vitamin D in reducing the risk and severity of COVID-19 has been suggested by several articles, but objective data on 25(OH)vitamin D deficiency in hospitalized COVID-19 patients are not conclusive. While vitamin D deficiency has been found to co-exist in patients with severe COVID-19 infection, and its immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory properties may have beneficial potential, further confirmation is needed to establish a definitive link between vitamin D and COVID-19 prevention or treatment. Therefore, it is not possible to definitively answer whether vitamin D prevents COVID-19 disease or mitigates its course based on the available evidence.",NEI
Is plasma therapy for covid-19 effective in preventing deaths?,NEI,"(Not Enough Information)

While the results indicate that plasma therapy may produce notable improvements in patients' clinical symptoms and biochemical parameters associated with COVID-19 infection, there is currently insufficient data to definitively establish its therapeutic efficacy in preventing deaths. The analysis of key safety metrics after transfusion of ABO-compatible human COVID-19 convalescent plasma in 5000 hospitalized adults revealed that the incidence of all serious adverse events, including mortality rate (0.3%), was less than 1% in the first 4 hours after transfusion. However, further research is needed to determine the long-term effects of plasma therapy and its impact on mortality rates in COVID-19 patients.",NEI
Does treatment with cortisone-like drugs such as dexamethasone ensure that more critically ill patients survive Covid 19 disease?,Yes,"Evidence from clinical trials indicates that systemic corticosteroids, such as dexamethasone, are associated with lower 28-day all-cause mortality in critically ill patients with Covid-19 compared to usual care or placebo. Furthermore, the use of intravenous dexamethasone in patients with moderate or severe ARDS resulted in a statistically significant increase in the number of ventilator-free days over 28 days. Low-dose corticosteroid treatment was also associated with a reduced risk of in-hospital death within 60 days in Covid-19 patients who developed ARDS. These findings suggest that treatment with cortisone-like drugs such as dexamethasone may improve survival outcomes in critically ill patients with Covid-19. However, it is important to note that the impact of corticosteroid therapy on outcomes of patients with Covid-19 remains highly controversial, and further research is needed to fully understand its benefits and risks.",Yes
Can contact with holy water make you sick?,Yes,"Justification: The microbiological and chemical water quality of holy springs and holy water in churches and hospital chapels have been found to be contaminated with pathogenic microorganisms and chemical pollutants. The consumption of such contaminated water has been linked to diseases such as amoebiasis, cholera, shigellosis, typhoid, and viral infections leading to gastroenteritis and hepatitis B. Moreover, the synergic effect of heavy metals, aluminum, arsenic, fluoride, and hardness in drinking water has been found to cause severe kidney damage in mice, even at maximum recommended levels. The presence of fecal indicators, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus in holy water samples from frequently visited churches further highlights the risk of infection through contact with holy water. Therefore, it can be concluded that contact with holy water can make one sick.",NEI

Does treatment with focused high-intensity ultrasound (HIFU) reduce abdominal girth?,Yes,"High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU) is a non-invasive fat reduction procedure that has been proven effective in reducing localized adiposities in the abdominal region. HIFU treatment accurately targets the subcutaneous fat layer and effectively reduces abdominal fat, as demonstrated in a porcine model. The procedure has been found to be an effective and safe treatment modality for reducing waist circumference in nonobese individuals with focal fat accumulation. HIFU treatment at different energy levels and multiple tissue depths has been well tolerated and effective in reducing waist circumference. Non-invasive devices for fat reduction involving HIFU are attracting attention, and the clinical use of HIFU therapy for noninvasive tissue ablation has been gaining momentum. Therefore, it can be concluded that treatment with focused high-intensity ultrasound (HIFU) reduces abdominal girth.",Yes
Does sugar substitution increase the risk of developing or dying from cancer?,Inconclusive,"The relationship between sugar substitution and cancer risk remains uncertain. While some studies suggest an association between the consumption of artificially sweetened soft drinks and an increased risk of certain cancers, the evidence is not definitive. It is important to note that epidemiologic evidence linking high sugar intake to cancer risk is also unclear, and further research is needed to establish a causal relationship. The potential mechanisms by which sugars or sugar substitutes may contribute to cancer development, such as through insulin-glucose dysregulation, oxidative stress, and inflammation, require further investigation. Therefore, it is not possible to definitively answer whether sugar substitution increases the risk of developing or dying from cancer based on the available evidence.",NEI
Does ozonated vegetable oil help against athlete's foot or nail fungus?,Yes,"Ozonated vegetable oils exhibit antimicrobial properties and have demonstrated effectiveness in treating dermatological diseases. The treatment of vegetable oils with ozone leads to the formation of chemical species responsible for these therapeutic properties. In particular, ozonated oils have shown promise as antifungal agents in the treatment of human dermatomycoses caused by filamentous fungi. Previous research has indicated that essential oils, including those derived from ozonated vegetable oils, can inhibit fungal growth. Furthermore, the ozonated oil and α-bisabolol combination has shown significant reductions in wound surface area, demonstrating its potential as a topical treatment for chronic venous leg ulcers. These findings suggest that ozonated vegetable oils could be beneficial in treating athlete's foot or nail fungus, although further research is needed to establish their efficacy in these specific applications.",NEI
Does ozonated vegetable oil help against vaginal fungus??,Yes,"Ozonated vegetable oils have been shown to possess antimicrobial properties, which can be attributed to the chemical reaction between ozone and unsaturated fatty acids. The resulting ozonized oils have been found to have antimicrobial properties, and have been commercialized as cosmetic and pharmaceutical agents. In particular, the ""in vitro"" antifungal activity of ozonized sunflower oil (Bioperoxoil®) was tested on 101 samples of yeasts originating from onychomycosis using the disk diffusion method. The study aimed to investigate the application of origanum vulgare L. essential oil (EO) as an alternative antimicrobial agent against vaginal infections. The experimental results indicated that citronella oil has strong antifungal activity, and was efficacious against several clinical fungal strains, including candida albicans, which is a common cause of vaginal fungal infections. The treatment of vegetable oils with ozone leads to the creation of a reservoir of ozone that slowly releases into the skin, providing a sustained antimicrobial effect. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that ozonated vegetable oils may help against vaginal fungus.",NEI
Are health checks of symptom-free individuals (screening) effective in containing the pandemic?,Yes,", with conditions.

Screening asymptomatic individuals for early detection and treatment of diseases has been recognized as a crucial public health intervention strategy. For infectious diseases, such as those causing pandemics, screening can benefit not only the individual with the disease but also the community by identifying and treating infectious persons before they transmit the disease to others. However, the effectiveness of screening in containing a pandemic depends on several factors. The condition must have a high prevalence in the population being screened to justify the cost and potential stress experienced by screen-positive, disease-negative subjects. Furthermore, the availability of a suitable screening test, effective treatment, and adequate resources are essential for a successful screening program. Community-based screening can augment the efficiency of diagnostic services, but the downstream impact of such programs requires further research. It is also important to ensure that the benefits of screening outweigh the harms and that patient willingness to undergo screening is considered. Therefore, while health checks of symptom-free individuals can be effective in containing a pandemic, careful consideration of these factors is necessary.",NEI
Does melatonin help against jet lag?,Yes,"Melatonin, a hormone produced by the pineal gland, plays a significant role in regulating the body's circadian rhythm. Its secretion is typically increased during nighttime, signaling the body to prepare for sleep. Research has suggested that melatonin may have therapeutic potential for alleviating jet lag, a condition characterized by disruption of the body's internal clock due to rapid travel across multiple time zones.

Studies have demonstrated that oral melatonin administration can reduce symptoms associated with jet lag syndrome, such as sleep disturbances and daytime fatigue. Both field and simulated studies have shown that appropriately timed melatonin supplementation can improve sleep and hasten the readaptation of the circadian rhythm following a phase shift. Furthermore, melatonin has been reported to have sleep-inducing effects in insomniacs and can significantly improve the quality and depth of nighttime sleep, while reducing the number of nighttime awakenings.

In conclusion, the evidence suggests that melatonin can be an effective treatment for jet lag syndrome, helping to alleviate symptoms and promote the re-establishment of a normal sleep-wake cycle following travel across multiple time zones.",Yes
Does sunscreen reduce the likelihood of skin cancer?,Yes,", with caveats.

Sunscreen use has been shown to reduce the risk of certain skin cancers, such as squamous cell carcinoma and melanoma, by providing protection against sunlight-induced erythema and sunburn. However, the effectiveness of sunscreen in preventing skin cancer is still a matter of debate. While sunscreen use is widely advocated as a preventive measure against sun-induced skin cancers, it is important to note that sunscreens are often used in a suboptimal manner, compromising their effectiveness. Furthermore, epidemiologic studies have associated sunscreen use with an increased risk of cutaneous melanoma, basal cell skin cancer, and higher numbers of nevi. It is also important to consider that sun exposure may have beneficial effects on health, such as vitamin D production. Therefore, while sunscreen use can reduce the likelihood of skin cancer, it is important to use it in conjunction with other sun protective measures and to avoid prolonged exposure to unfiltered ultraviolet radiation.",NEI
Are international travel restrictions and border health checks effective in curbing the spread of covid-19?,Yes,"Justification: The implementation of international travel restrictions and border health checks has been a prevalent strategy employed by numerous countries to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. These measures have included airport closures, limitations on international travel, and strict border transit restrictions for trading traffic. Symptom screening has become a widespread tool in the global response to COVID-19, and vaccine entry requirements have proven effective in controlling the international spread of diseases such as yellow fever. The reduction of international passenger traffic by over 80% below 2019 levels due to COVID-19 and its associated travel bans further supports the effectiveness of these restrictions. Moreover, precautionary measures adopted by health authorities, such as those in Saudi Arabia, have been evidently successful in controlling the spread and burden of COVID-19. Monitoring COVID-19 prevalence and gathering evidence to inform strategies for limiting transmission on public transport are also crucial components of these efforts.",Yes
Does hypnosis help with smoking cessation?,Possibly,"Efficacious

Empirical evidence from 59 studies reviewed in an article suggests that hypnosis may have a therapeutic effect on smoking cessation. The reviewed studies indicate that hypnosis can lead to decreased craving in smokers. Furthermore, a randomized controlled trial was designed to evaluate the effects of group hypnosis as a method for smoking cessation, comparing it to group relaxation. The study found that hypnosis can be classified as a ""possibly efficacious"" treatment for smoking cessation. However, it is important to note that the efficacy of hypnosis as a specific and efficacious treatment for smoking cessation has not been scientifically proven. Therefore, while hypnosis may aid in smoking cessation, it cannot be considered a definitive treatment.",NEI
Does denosumab (Prolia) reduce the risk of vertebral fractures in osteoporosis?,Yes,"Denosumab (Prolia) has been shown to significantly reduce the risk of vertebral fractures in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. This reduction in fracture risk is attributed to its potent antiresorptive properties, which lead to a significant decrease in bone resorption and an increase in bone mineral density (BMD). The FREEDOM trial demonstrated that denosumab reduced the incidence of new vertebral fractures compared to placebo, with a relative risk reduction of 68%. Furthermore, denosumab has been shown to be particularly effective in reducing fracture risk in women with multiple and/or severe prevalent vertebral fractures. The mechanism by which denosumab reduces fracture risk is through its specific inhibition of the receptor activator for nuclear factor-kappa B ligand (RANKL), a key mediator of osteoclast differentiation and activation.",Yes
Does discontinuation of denosumab increase the risk of vertebral fractures???,Yes,"Recent studies have indicated an increased risk of multiple vertebral fractures upon discontinuation of denosumab treatment. This elevated risk is attributed to a rebound effect, characterized by a rapid return of bone mineral density (BMD) to baseline levels and a subsequent rise in bone turnover, leading to a loss of BMD. The increased bone resorption following denosumab discontinuation has been associated with an elevated risk of rebound fractures. In postmenopausal women with osteoporosis, the discontinuation of denosumab has been linked to a higher incidence of vertebral fractures due to rebound bone turnover and rapid BMD loss. The risk of multiple vertebral fractures is particularly high in patients with a prior history of vertebral fractures. The vertebral fracture rate has been observed to rise significantly after denosumab discontinuation, reaching levels comparable to those in untreated participants. Therefore, based on current evidence, it is recommended that alternative treatments be considered before stopping denosumab to prevent rapid BMD loss and a potential increase in vertebral fracture risk.",NEI
Does taking magnesium improve the symptoms of depression?,Yes,", with caveats

Evidence suggests a potential role for magnesium in improving depressive symptoms, particularly in adults with mild-to-moderate depression. Magnesium, an endogenous N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist, has been implicated in the pathophysiology of depression and has demonstrated antidepressant effects in preclinical and clinical studies. Lower serum magnesium levels have been associated with depressive symptoms in primary care settings, supporting the use of supplemental magnesium as a therapeutic intervention. However, the precise mechanism by which magnesium exerts its antidepressant effects remains unclear, and the role of magnesium in symptom management is not fully understood. Additionally, while a higher intake of dietary magnesium appears to be associated with lower depression symptoms, reverse causality cannot be excluded. Despite promising findings, the available evidence remains inconclusive, and further research is needed to elucidate the relationship between magnesium and depression.",NEI
Does focused ultrasound (HIFU) treatment reduce wrinkles and sagging of the skin?,Yes,"High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) has been established as an effective noninvasive modality for improving skin laxity and tightening with minimal adverse effects. Its clinical benefits in skin tightening have been proven through various studies. HIFU produces thermal effects at various depths while sparing the overlying epidermis, which leads to collagen regeneration and improvement in skin laxity. This regeneration process contributes to the reduction of wrinkles and sagging of the skin. HIFU has also been found to be efficacious for skin rejuvenation, body contouring, and reduction of cellulite in areas such as the face, décolletage, abdomen, and thighs. The safety and efficacy of HIFU for facial skin tightening have been validated in multiple studies, further supporting its role in reducing wrinkles and sagging of the skin.",NEI
Does a ketogenic diet help against cancer?,NEI,"The potential of a ketogenic diet as a therapeutic or preventive strategy in cancer is currently under investigation. While recent studies have suggested that a ketogenic diet may enhance sensitivity to chemotherapy and radiotherapy in cancer patients, the results are not yet supportive and inconsistent. The exact mechanism of its therapeutic effect is not completely known, and high-quality evidence on the effect of ketogenic diets on anthropometry, metabolism, quality of life, and tumor effects is currently lacking in oncology patients. Therefore, it is not possible to definitively state whether a ketogenic diet helps against cancer based on the current evidence.",NEI
Do curd compresses have an analgesic effect (e.g. for muscle and joint pain)? Do they have an antipyretic effect? Do curd compresses help breastfeeding women with lactation congestion?,NEI,"Justification: The given context discusses the effects of herbal compresses on breast engorgement pain and compares them to hot compress treatments. However, there is no mention of curd compresses or their potential analgesic, antipyretic, or lactation congestion relief effects. Therefore, based on the provided information, it is not possible to determine whether curd compresses have an analgesic effect for muscle and joint pain, an antipyretic effect, or if they help breastfeeding women with lactation congestion. Further research is needed to answer these questions.",NEI
Does deuterium-reduced water prevent cancer?,Yes,"The context suggests that deuterium-depleted water (DDW) has been shown to have anti-cancer effects in various studies. These studies include in vitro experiments on human lung cancer cell lines, in vivo experiments on xenotransplanted mice, and clinical studies on humans. The results indicate that DDW can decrease the growth rate of cancer cells and inhibit tumor growth. Furthermore, DDW has been shown to delay tumor progression in various animals and humans. Although the molecular mechanism underlying these effects remains unclear, the evidence suggests that DDW can prevent cancer.",NEI
Does deuterium-reduced water improve disease progression in cancer???,Yes,"The scientific literature supports the claim that deuterium-reduced water has potential benefits in improving disease progression in cancer. In vitro, in vivo, and clinical studies have demonstrated anti-cancer effects of deuterium depleted water (DDW), including a significant decrease in the growth rate of the L929 fibroblast cell line and inhibition of tumor growth in xenotransplanted mice. Natural water with 65% of the deuterium concentration depleted has also been shown to exhibit anti-tumor properties. The use of DDW in oncological patients who also suffered from diabetes resulted in an improvement of glucose metabolism. The molecular mechanism underlying the anti-cancer effects of DDW remains unclear, but it has been proposed that DDW activates the DNA repair system and increases the efficiency of defensive systems in the cell. The use of DDW as a potential modulator of adjuvant therapy on colorectal cancer models has also been assessed. The experimental data supports the use of DDW in cancer prevention and treatment, including as a mitochondrial downstream mechanism of targeted anti-cancer drugs. The patients received 1.5 liters of water with reduced deuterium content daily for 90 days, and the role of naturally occurring deuterium in living organisms has been examined using DDW. The objective was to investigate whether DDW can overturn manganese-induced reduction in life span, using Caenorhabditis elegans as a model system. The anti-cancer activity of DDW has been shown by its preferential cell-growth inhibition to human tongue carcinoma cells over normal human tongue cells.",NEI
Can a special mattress relieve nighttime rheumatism symptoms and thus improve sleep?,Yes,"Scientific evidence suggests that sleeping mattress parameters significantly influence sleeping comfort and health, particularly in the context of preventing sleep-related musculoskeletal problems. Given the reciprocal relationship between sleep disturbances and pain in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), optimizing sleep conditions is crucial for managing RA symptoms. Although there is currently insufficient evidence to determine the efficacy of pharmacological treatments for improving sleep quantity and quality in RA patients, studies have indicated that temperature alterations of mattresses can promote sleep quality and reduce pain. Therefore, it is plausible that a special mattress designed to address the specific needs of RA patients could alleviate nighttime rheumatism symptoms and improve sleep, although further research is needed to confirm this hypothesis.",NEI
Do people with blood group AB have a higher risk of developing dementia?,No,"Recent studies have not found a significant association between blood group AB and the risk of developing dementia, including Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia, or unspecified dementia. However, there is evidence of an increased incidence of cognitive deficits in elderly individuals with blood group AB, which may suggest a potential link between blood group and cognitive function. Additionally, individuals with non-O blood groups, including AB, have been found to have an increased risk of venous thrombosis, heart disease, and ischemic stroke, which could indirectly impact cognitive function. Further research is needed to fully understand the relationship between blood group and cognitive decline, as well as the potential role of the ABO gene in the onset and progression of neurodegenerative diseases.",No
Does therapeutic dancing help people with Parkinson's improve their movement problems?,Yes,"Research has consistently demonstrated that therapeutic dancing can have a positive impact on individuals living with Parkinson's disease (PD). Studies have shown that dance can improve motor impairments, specifically balance and motor symptom severity in individuals with mild to moderate PD. Controlled studies on group-delivered dance for people with mild-to-moderate stage PD have shown statistically and clinically significant improvements in gait, balance, and psychosocial factors. Dance can also serve as an adjunct to traditional treatments to improve gait, balance, and quality of life in people with PD. Additionally, tango dance interventions have been shown to preferentially improve mobility and motor signs in people with PD, compared to other interventions. Overall, the reviewed evidence supports the use of dance as a non-pharmacological intervention to help maintain functional independence and quality of life in people with PD.",Yes
Is it possible to reliably detect coronavirus infection based only on symptoms but without laboratory testing?,No,"Justification: The diagnosis of coronavirus infection, specifically Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV), is primarily reliant on laboratory-based tests due to its nonspecific clinical features. These features often resemble those of other respiratory pathogens, making clinical diagnosis challenging without confirmatory tests. The gold standard for diagnosis is the detection of viral nucleic acid using Real-Time Reverse Transcriptase-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR). Although there is a need for early identification of symptoms, particularly in asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic individuals, the lack of specificity in clinical presentation precludes reliable diagnosis based solely on symptoms. Additionally, false negatives in nucleic acid detection can occur, further underscoring the importance of laboratory testing. Therefore, it is not possible to reliably detect coronavirus infection based only on symptoms without laboratory testing.",No
Are home coronavirus self-tests as reliable as tests performed by trained healthcare professionals?,NEI,"Justification: The provided context does not explicitly address the reliability of home-based coronavirus self-tests compared to tests performed by trained healthcare professionals. However, it does mention the importance of eHealth techniques for monitoring patients at home during the coronavirus pandemic, and the use of home sample collection tests for HIV infection without medical supervision. Additionally, the context discusses the evaluation of self-sampling for HPV detection and the performance of various tests under real-life pressures. Nevertheless, without specific data on the accuracy and reliability of home-based coronavirus self-tests, it is not possible to definitively answer the question.",NEI
Does biotin help with hair loss? Does biotin make hair grow faster?,Yes,"The systematic review of the literature indicates that biotin may be beneficial for hair loss treatment and hair growth. In cases of acquired and inherited biotin deficiency, as well as pathologies such as brittle nail syndrome or uncombable hair, biotin supplementation has shown promise. The study found that biotin supplementation led to a decrease in daily hair loss and an increase in hair density and thickness. Furthermore, biotin increased hair growth rate. The mechanism by which biotin promotes hair growth is thought to be through its effects on critical events in the active phase of the hair follicle cycle, including the promotion of the proliferation of dermal papilla cells and their immediate progeny to the follicle base. However, it is important to note that research demonstrating the efficacy of biotin is limited, and further studies are needed to fully understand its potential benefits and limitations.",NEI
Can induction of labor prevent infant deaths in pregnancies that go beyond the estimated due date? Does it reduce the number of neonatal intensive care unit stays?,Yes,"Induction of labor in pregnancies beyond the estimated due date is associated with fewer perinatal deaths compared to expectant management. This is supported by a policy of labor induction at 41 completed weeks or beyond, which was associated with a lower risk of all-cause perinatal deaths (RR 0.30, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.99). Additionally, fewer babies in the labor induction group had meconium aspiration syndrome (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.73) compared to expectant management. However, there were no significant differences in the rate of NICU admission between the two groups. Overall, the evidence suggests that induction of labor can prevent infant deaths in pregnancies that go beyond the estimated due date, but it may not necessarily reduce the number of NICU stays.",Yes
Does induction of labor make cesarean sections less necessary than observational waiting?,Yes,"Recent systematic reviews and observational studies have found that elective induction of labor at 39 weeks in low-risk nulliparous women is associated with a decreased risk of cesarean delivery compared to expectant management. This is in contrast to the commonly held belief that labor induction increases the risk of cesarean delivery. However, it is important to note that inappropriate elective inductions of labor can put patients at increased risk of cesarean, neonatal morbidity, and elevated cost. Additionally, labor induction did not reduce cesarean delivery rates but intervention to delivery and to hospital discharge durations are shorter. Therefore, obstetrical providers must consider the risks and benefits of induction of labor for women with a history of prior cesarean delivery versus repeat cesarean delivery.",Yes
Does the number of deliveries with a vacuum cup and forceps remain similar with induction and observational waiting???,No,"Justification: The rate of vacuum deliveries has increased against forceps application over the past decade, indicating a disparity in their usage. Additionally, in a study of 374 instrument-assisted deliveries, 86.7% were conducted with a vacuum, while only 13.3% were performed with forceps. This suggests that the number of deliveries with a vacuum cup and forceps does not remain similar with induction and observational waiting.",Yes
"Does taking supplements with omega-3 fatty acids reduce the risk of heart attack, stroke or other sudden cardiovascular problems?  Does it lower the risk of dying prematurely?",Yes,"Evidence suggests that dietary supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids significantly reduces the risk of cardiovascular deaths, sudden cardiac death, all-cause mortality, and nonfatal cardiovascular events. Omega-3 fatty acid supplementation has been associated with a decreased cardiovascular risk, potentially preventing tachyarrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. In post-myocardial infarction patients, omega-3 fatty acid supplementation reduces the risk of sudden cardiac death and death from any cause within 4 months. Furthermore, omega-3 fatty acid supplement use is independently associated with a lower risk of non-fatal ischemic stroke. Current evidence suggests that individuals with coronary artery disease may reduce their risk of sudden cardiac death by increasing their intake of long-chain omega-3 fatty acids by approximately 1 g per day. Consumption of omega-3 fatty acids is associated with a reduction in deaths from coronary heart disease, arrhythmia, and sudden death. N-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (omega-3) supplementation is associated with reduced cardiovascular mortality and post-infarction death. Dietary supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids should be considered in the secondary prevention of cardiovascular events.",No
"Can taking dietary supplements with omega-3 fatty acids prevent further heart attacks or strokes if one has already had a heart attack?  In this case, does it lower the risk of dying prematurely??",Yes,"Evidence from epidemiological and clinical studies suggests that dietary supplements containing omega-3 fatty acids may reduce the risk of sudden cardiac death in patients with documented coronary heart disease, following a myocardial infarction. Increasing the intake of long-chain omega-3 fatty acids by approximately 1 g per day has been shown to decrease the risk of sudden cardiac death in individuals with coronary artery disease. The cardioprotective effects of omega-3 fatty acids have been documented in epidemiologic and randomized controlled trials, and they appear to be beneficial in secondary prevention of cardiovascular events. The reduction in risk for sudden cardiac death seen with omega-3 fatty acid supplementation may be due to the prevention of fatal arrhythmias and an increase in vagal activity. However, it should be noted that in some patients with heart disease, omega-3 fatty acid supplementation may increase the risk of potentially fatal cardiac arrhythmias and the risk of sudden cardiac death.",No
Can cosmetic products with caffeine for hair and scalp help against hereditary hair loss?,NEI,"(Not Enough Information)

Despite the extensive use of caffeine in hair growth cosmetic products, the context does not provide direct evidence supporting the claim that cosmetic products with caffeine for hair and scalp can help against hereditary hair loss. While the context suggests that lower concentrations of caffeine have a protective role in aging-related disorders and that caffeine can prevent the proliferation of carcinoma cells, these findings do not directly address hereditary hair loss. Additionally, the context does not provide information on the specific mechanisms by which caffeine may promote hair growth or prevent hair loss. Therefore, further research is needed to determine whether cosmetic products with caffeine for hair and scalp can effectively help against hereditary hair loss.",NEI
Is music therapy with rhythmic training helpful for people with Parkinson's who have trouble walking?,Yes,"Recent evidence suggests that music-based movement therapy, which includes rhythmic auditory stimulation, can be a promising intervention for improving gait and gait-related activities in individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD). This therapy combines cognitive movement strategies, cueing techniques, balance exercises, and physical activity while focusing on the enjoyment of moving to music. Entrainment of walking to rhythmic auditory cues, such as metronome and/or music, has been shown to improve gait in people with PD. Gait dysfunctions in PD can be partly relieved by rhythmic auditory cueing. Additionally, PD patients' gait improves when they walk with an auditory metronome or with music, despite impaired audiomotor synchronization. Music therapy and other music and rhythm-based interventions may offer a range of symptomatic benefits to patients with PD and other movement disorders. Recent behavioral data has shown beneficial effects of musically cued gait training on gait performance, perceptual timing, and sensorimotor timing abilities in PD patients. Cueing training may be a useful therapeutic adjunct to the overall management of gait disturbance in PD. Walking while mentally singing has potential for improving the gait of individuals with PD.",Yes
Do preparations with unsaponifiable components of avocado and soybean oils (ASU) help against limitations and pain in osteoarthritis of the knee joint?,Yes,"The use of preparations with unsaponifiable components of avocado and soybean oils (ASU) has been reported to exert beneficial effects in the treatment of osteoarticular diseases, including osteoarthritis (OA). These components have been shown to have a chondroprotective effect, which is attributed to their anti-inflammatory and proanabolic effects on articular chondrocytes. Furthermore, ASU has been reported to reduce cartilage catabolism and chondrocytic synthesis of inflammatory mediators associated with OA. Clinical evidence suggests that ASU can reduce OA pain and improve functional ability in patients with knee OA. While further studies are needed to fully understand the mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effects of ASU, the available evidence supports its use as a potential treatment option for managing limitations and pain in knee OA.",Yes
Do preparations with unsaponifiable components of avocado and soybean oils (ASU) help against limitations and pain in osteoarthritis of the hip joint?,Yes,"Avocado/soybean unsaponifiables (ASU) have been reported to exert beneficial effects in the treatment of osteoarthritis (OA) and are known as an antiarthritic agent. ASU components are reported to have a chondroprotective effect by virtue of anti-inflammatory and proanabolic effects on articular chondrocytes. ASU has been shown to reduce cartilage catabolism and chondrocytic synthesis of inflammatory mediators associated with OA. ASU is recommended to act as an adjuvant treatment for osteoarthritic pain and slow-acting symptomatic treatment of hip and knee OA. While there is some clinical evidence that ASU can reduce OA pain, no preclinical studies have corroborated this observation. However, ASU is one of the most commonly used drugs for symptomatic OA and is characterized by its potent anti-inflammatory effects. In summary, ASU has been shown to have a beneficial effect in reducing limitations and pain in osteoarthritis of the hip joint.",No
Is it safe to take preparations containing unsaponifiable components of avocado and soybean oils (ASU)?,Yes,", with a caveat

Based on available data, preparations containing unsaponifiable components of avocado and soybean oils (ASU) have been reported to exert beneficial effects in the treatment of periodontal and osteoarticular diseases, including osteoarthritis. These components have been shown to have a chondroprotective effect, which is attributed to their anti-inflammatory and proanabolic effects on articular chondrocytes. However, it is important to note that while ASU has shown promise for the treatment of osteoarthritis, virtually nothing is known about the safety of this oil for humans. Therefore, caution should be exercised when using ASU preparations, and it is recommended to consult with a healthcare professional before starting any new treatment regimen.",Yes
Can taking chondroitin relieve osteoarthritis pain or improve mobility in the long term?,Yes,"Chondroitin sulfate, a symptomatic slow-acting drug for osteoarthritis, has been shown to relieve pain and improve functional limitation in patients with knee osteoarthritis in numerous clinical trials and meta-analyses. Its therapeutic and chondroprotective properties include stabilizing synthesis processes and cartilage degradation, increasing proteoglycan and hyaluronic acid biosynthesis, inhibiting the activity of proteolytic enzymes and hyaluronidase, reducing inflammatory mediators, and decreasing collagen II degradation. Although various meta-analyses have concluded that chondroitin sulfate has a beneficial effect on symptoms and structure, others have concluded little or no benefit. However, pooled results demonstrated a small significant effect of chondroitin sulfate on the reduction in rate of decline in minimum joint space width of 0.07 mm/year (95% ci 0.03, 0.10) that corresponded to an effect size of 0.26 (95% ci 0.14, 0.38) (p < 0.0001). For patients with painful knee osteoarthritis, long-term symptomatic relief may improve quality of life.",No
Does taking arginine benefit existing cardiovascular disease or does arginine prevent it from developing?,Yes,"Arginine, a physiologic substrate of nitric oxide synthase, has demonstrated cardioprotective benefits through mechanisms such as the nitric oxide pathway. In patients with existing cardiovascular diseases, arginine supplementation has shown promise as a safe therapeutic option to improve endogenous nitric oxide regulation, particularly in cases associated with endothelial dysfunction. This is supported by findings that arginine has anti-inflammatory and metabolic advantages in coronary artery disease patients, and can ameliorate endothelial dysfunction and insulin sensitivity in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients. Furthermore, arginine supplementation has been proposed to reduce endothelial dysfunction and atherogenesis via increased biosynthesis of nitric oxide, which has been shown to attenuate the progression of atherosclerosis in animal models. In addition, arginine has been suggested to improve health status or as an adjunct therapy for diseases including cardiovascular diseases. Therefore, arginine supplementation can benefit existing cardiovascular disease.

     Regarding prevention, arginase inhibition, resulting in higher arginine availability for nitric oxide synthesis, may account for the putative protective effect of homoarginine against atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease. Additionally, arginine supplementation has been proposed to reverse endothelial dysfunction in diverse pathophysiologic conditions such as hypercholesterolemia, coronary heart disease, and some forms of animal hypertension. These findings suggest that arginine may also play a role in preventing the development of cardiovascular diseases.",NEI

Additionally, the context discusses the use of specific drugs such as mebendazole (vermox) to eliminate trichuris infestations. Therefore, it is not possible to definitively answer whether ""Detoxic"" is effective against tapeworms and other parasites or helps with health complaints based on the provided context.",NEI
Is mannose as good as or better than antibiotics for preventing recurrent cystitis?,NEI,"(Not Enough Information)

While the results of the study suggest that d-mannose can be an effective aid in acute cystitis management and a successful prophylactic agent for recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs), it is important to note that more studies are needed to confirm these findings. The study also indicates that the association of mannose and N-acetylcysteine (NAC) therapy resulted in similar outcomes to antibiotic therapy in preventing UTIs in patients undergoing urodynamic examination. However, the study does not provide a direct comparison between mannose and antibiotics for preventing recurrent cystitis. Therefore, it is not possible to definitively conclude whether mannose is as good as or better than antibiotics for preventing recurrent cystitis based on the available information.",NEI
Does taking vitamin K lower the risk of spinal fractures in older women?,Yes,"Evidence suggests that vitamin K supplementation, particularly vitamin K2, may play a role in reducing the incidence of vertebral fractures in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. Although the exact mechanisms are not fully understood, vitamin K has been shown to improve indices of bone strength and reduce the risk of fractures, even without significantly increasing bone mass. However, it is important to note that the evidence is not entirely consistent, and the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of vitamin K supplementation for bone health remain a matter of controversy. Nonetheless, the available data suggest that vitamin K may have a protective role against bone loss and osteoporotic fractures associated with aging, including spinal fractures in older women.",No
Does taking vitamin K lower the risk of other bone fractures in older women?,Yes,"Evidence suggests that vitamin K supplementation, particularly vitamin K2, may play a role in reducing the incidence of fractures in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. This is supported by findings that vitamin K reduces vertebral and hip fractures without increasing bone mass, indicating a potential impact on bone quality. Furthermore, high dietary vitamin K intake has been associated with superior bone properties, and supplementation during menopause may decrease bone loss and the risk of bone breaking. Despite inconsistent data and uncertainties about effectiveness and cost-effectiveness, the potential protective role of vitamin K against bone loss and osteoporotic fractures in older women cannot be disregarded.",Yes
Does Smartsleep provide better or more restful sleep?,NEI,"The context does not provide specific information on the effects of SmartSleep, a proprietary sleep technology, on sleep quality or restfulness. However, it does discuss the benefits of napping and deep non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, also known as slow-wave sleep (SWS), which is thought to be the most restorative sleep stage. The review explores the effects of daytime split-sleep schedules and naps on recovery, wakefulness performance, cognition, and health in older individuals. It also discusses the distinct and complementary contributions of NREM and REM sleep to overall sleep function. The review suggests that napping can have positive effects on alertness, cognitive performance, and biological functions, while noting that the impact of naps on mood and alertness in depressed patients remains to be explored. The context also mentions that it is controversial whether napping can provide the same enhancement as overnight sleep. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether SmartSleep provides better or more restful sleep based solely on the provided context.",NEI
"Can supplemental tryptophan, taken as a dietary supplement or with food, help with depression?",Yes,"Scientific Explanation: The evidence suggests that supplemental tryptophan, when taken as a dietary supplement or with food, may have a beneficial effect on depression. Tryptophan is a precursor to serotonin, a neurotransmitter that plays a crucial role in mood regulation. Low levels of serotonin have been linked to depression, and tryptophan supplementation has been shown to increase serotonin neurotransmission, potentially alleviating depressive symptoms. Clinical studies have demonstrated a significant association between higher tryptophan intake and a lower prevalence of depressive symptoms in young women. Additionally, tryptophan has been employed as an adjunct with traditional antidepressants to enhance their effectiveness in treating affective disorders. However, it is important to note that the clinical effectiveness of tryptophan must be considered with caution, as a definitive relationship between dietary tryptophan intake and depressive symptoms has not been established.",NEI
Can Neuro-Socks relieve pain or improve balance and stability?,NEI,"The context provided does not explicitly mention Neuro-Socks or similar devices, making it impossible to definitively state whether they can relieve pain or improve balance and stability. However, the information suggests that peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS) and spinal cord stimulation (SCS) have shown promise in managing neuropathic pain and improving activity. Additionally, specific therapeutic exercises and manual therapy have been effective for improving neck pain and functional ability. Given the potential success of novel devices designed to target the peripheral nervous system, it is plausible that Neuro-Socks, if designed with a similar purpose, could potentially offer pain relief or improve balance and stability. Nevertheless, further research and large-scale randomized controlled studies are necessary to confirm the efficacy of such devices in the long term.",NEI
"Does taking blood pressure medication in the evening prevent more heart attacks, strokes, and other acute cardiovascular diseases?",Yes,"Evidence suggests that evening administration of antihypertensive medication is associated with a significant reduction in non-dipper blood pressure patterns, which may greatly reduce cardiovascular morbidity in hypertensive patients. Nighttime dosing of antihypertensive agents has been shown to have a larger blood pressure lowering effect during nighttime and the early morning hours, which are associated with increased cardiovascular risk independently of the average 24 h blood pressure. While the timing of antihypertensive drug administration (morning or evening) did not affect mean 24-hour or clinic blood pressure levels, nighttime blood pressure strongly predicts cardiovascular events. Therefore, it is plausible that taking blood pressure medication in the evening could prevent more heart attacks, strokes, and other acute cardiovascular diseases. However, further research is needed to confirm these findings and determine the optimal dosing regimen for individual patients.",NEI
"In Covid-19, do nicotine or smoking have a protective effect, i.e., do they prevent severe progression or death?",NEI,"(Not Enough Information)

Scientific evidence suggests that nicotine, a primary component of tobacco smoke, may have potential protective effects in COVID-19 due to its anti-inflammatory properties and the modulation of lung macrophage responses. Additionally, increased nitric oxide levels in the respiratory tract, which can be induced by smoking, may inhibit the replication of SARS-CoV-2 and its entry into cells. However, it is essential to note that these findings are based on preliminary research, and the overall impact of smoking on COVID-19 severity remains controversial.

While some studies indicate that active smokers are underrepresented among COVID-19 patients, other investigations report contradictory results, with smoking increasing the risk of complications and worsening susceptibility to the disease. The potential protective effects of nicotine and nitric oxide in reducing the risk of a ""cytokine storm"" warrant further assessment through controlled clinical trials.

It is crucial to acknowledge that smoking is a well-established risk factor for morbidity and mortality in several respiratory infections, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Smoking cessation remains the only proven intervention to slow disease progression in COPD. Therefore, the claim that smoking has a protective effect in COVID-19 remains uncertain, and more extensive studies are needed to clarify the relationship between smoking and COVID-19 severity.",NEI
Can red mold rice products lower blood cholesterol levels?,Yes,"Red yeast rice, also known as red mold rice, has been demonstrated to effectively lower blood cholesterol levels. This product contains monacolins, unsaturated fatty acids, and phytosterols, which contribute to its cholesterol-lowering properties. The primary active ingredient responsible for blocking cholesterol production is monacolin K. Red yeast rice has been shown to decrease total and LDL cholesterol levels, improve lipid profiles, and reduce lipid ratios in hypercholesterolemic patients. Additionally, red yeast rice has been found to be well-tolerated and an acceptable alternative for patients who are intolerant of other lipid-lowering medications. However, it is important to note that the variability in monacolin K content across different red yeast rice preparations can make it challenging to predict or understand dose-related efficacy and side-effect risks.",Yes

Can disinfectants containing highly diluted sodium hypochlorite (below 0.1%) render corona and other viruses harmless and thus protect against infection?,No,"The efficacy of sodium hypochlorite solutions in inactivating viruses depends on the concentration of the solution. Sodium hypochlorite solutions lower than 0.52% were found to be less effective for complete inactivation of poliovirus. Moreover, sodium hypochlorite solutions with a concentration of 0.63% were able to achieve a high level of virus reduction (>10 log10) for poliovirus in suspension and dried on surfaces. The virucidal activity of chlorine-compounds was also studied using hepatitis A virus (HAV) and poliovirus 2, and it was found that sodium hypochlorite solution at 5000 ppm could inactivate feline calicivirus (FCV) by 3 log(10) plaque forming units after approximately 1.9 minutes of contact time. However, longer exposure times were required to reduce other viruses such as murine norovirus (MNV) and coliphage MS2. Therefore, based on the available information, it can be concluded that disinfectants containing highly diluted sodium hypochlorite (below 0.1%) may not be effective in rendering corona and other viruses harmless and thus protecting against infection.",NEI

Do essential oils protect against corona infections and other viral infections like colds or flu?,Yes,"Justification: Essential oils have demonstrated antiviral activity against several pathogenic viruses, including influenza and coronaviruses, through in vitro and in vivo experiments. The main mechanism of antiviral effects of essential oils has been found to cause capsid disintegration and viral expansion, which prevents the virus from infecting host cells. Specific compounds in essential oils have been reported to exert potent antiviral effects against influenza type A virus, and a study reported 221 phytochemical compounds and essential oils to be effective against severe acute respiratory syndrome associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Essential oils have also been shown to inhibit hemagglutinin, an important membrane protein of various viruses, which allows the virus to enter the host cell. Furthermore, many essential oils and their components could inhibit the late stages of viral life cycle by targeting the redox signalling pathway. Therefore, essential oils have the potential to protect against corona infections and other viral infections like colds or flu.",NEI
Do air purifiers help relieve symptoms of allergic asthma?,Yes,"Justification: The use of air purifiers, specifically HEPA air purifiers, has been shown to effectively reduce the concentration of particulate matter and allergens in indoor air, thereby improving clinical manifestations in patients with allergic rhinitis (AR). These purifiers have been recommended by clinicians for AR patients and have been found to decrease allergen exposure and improve airway hyperresponsiveness in asthmatic patients. In a study, 32 subjects diagnosed with AR were selected and HEPA air purifiers were placed in their bedrooms for 4 months, resulting in a reduction in disease activity in the homes of AR patients sensitive to mugwort pollen. The main goals of asthma treatment are to decrease inflammation and maximize bronchodilation, and air purifiers can contribute to this by reducing the concentration of allergens in the air.",No

Does platelet-rich plasma therapy (autologous blood therapy) reduce pain in osteoarthritis of the hip joint???,Yes,", with limitations.

Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) therapy has been shown to provide symptomatic relief in early osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee joint. While the effectiveness of intra-articular PRP injections has been evaluated in knee OA, little evidence of its efficacy in hip OA exists. However, recent studies suggest that PRP may provide pain relief and functional improvement for up to six months in patients with mild/moderate hip OA. Intra-articular injections of PRP are efficacious in terms of functional improvement and pain reduction, but are not superior to hyaluronic acid (HA) in patients with symptomatic hip OA at 12-month follow-up. Therefore, while PRP therapy may be beneficial for reducing pain in hip OA, further research is needed to fully understand its long-term efficacy and potential limitations.",No
"Can vitamin D supplements prevent colds, flu, colds, and other viral respiratory illnesses when there is no or only a mild deficiency of vitamin D?",No,"Justification: The evidence suggests that while vitamin D deficiency is linked to an increased risk of respiratory viral infections, there is no conclusive evidence that supplementation with high-dose vitamin D can prevent colds, flu, and other viral respiratory illnesses in individuals with no or only mild deficiency. In fact, studies have found that daily administration of 2000 IU compared with 400 IU of vitamin D supplementation did not reduce overall wintertime upper respiratory tract infections in healthy children aged 1 to 5 years. Furthermore, the routine use of high-dose vitamin D supplementation for the prevention of viral upper respiratory tract infections is not supported by current evidence. Therefore, it is not recommended to use high-dose vitamin D supplementation for the prevention of viral respiratory illnesses in individuals with no or only mild deficiency.",No
Does ACE inhibitors like ramipril increase the risk of lung cancer?,NEI,"The claim that ACE inhibitors like ramipril increase the risk of lung cancer requires further investigation. A retrospective cohort study found an association between the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and calcium channel blockers with an increased rate of lung cancer. However, regular use of ACE inhibitors/ARBs was not associated with an increased risk of cancer development and was found to decrease overall cancer risk in this study. Conflicting reports exist regarding the cancer risk associated with ACE inhibitors/ARBs. Additional research is needed to further investigate a potentially increased risk of lung cancer with ACE inhibitors like ramipril.",NEI
"Does propolis have a preventive or soothing effect against infection with coronavirus, colds or flu?",Yes,"Propolis, a resinous material produced by honey bees from plant exudates, has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its antimicrobial, antiparasitic, antiviral, anti-inflammatory, antitumoral and antioxidant properties. In the context of the current COVID-19 pandemic, propolis has been presented as a promising and relevant therapeutic option due to its diverse array of biological actions. Propolis has been shown to promote immunoregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including reduction in IL-6, IL-1 beta and TNF-α, and has anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory activities. Furthermore, propolis components have inhibitory effects on the ACE2, TMPRSS2 and PAK1 signaling pathways, and antiviral activity has been proven in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, it can be concluded that propolis may have a preventive or soothing effect against infection with coronavirus, colds or flu.",NEI
Does DAILY administration of HIGH-dose atropine (0.5 - 1%) sustainably inhibit the progression of myopia in children?,Yes,"Evidence suggests that daily administration of high-dose atropine (0.5-1%) can sustainably inhibit the progression of myopia in children. A starting dose of atropine 0.5% was associated with decreased myopia progression in European children during a 3-year treatment regimen. Additionally, topical atropine 1% reduced the degree of low myopia and slowed the progression of ocular axial elongation in children. Furthermore, the effectiveness of atropine in controlling myopia progression was found to be dose-related. Therefore, it can be concluded that daily administration of high-dose atropine (0.5-1%) is an effective treatment option for children at risk of developing high myopia in adulthood.",No
Does MONTHLY administered HIGH-dose atropine (1%) sustainably inhibit the progression of myopia in children?,Insufficient,"Information

The available information indicates that daily administered high-dose atropine (1%) has been studied for its efficacy in slowing myopia progression in children. The study found that a group of 15 myopic children who received daily atropine 1% ophthalmic solution bilaterally for a mean of 29.3 months (range 3-96) had slower myopia progression compared to a control group of 15 similar myopic patients. However, the study does not provide information on the effects of monthly administered high-dose atropine (1%) on myopia progression in children. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether monthly administered high-dose atropine (1%) sustainably inhibits the progression of myopia in children based on the available information.",Yes
Does LOW dose atropine (0.05% or less) sustainably inhibit the progression of myopia in children???,Yes,"Evidence suggests that low-dose atropine (0.05% or less) can sustainably inhibit the progression of myopia in children. Randomized clinical trials have shown that regular topical administration of 0.025% atropine eye drops can prevent myopia onset and myopic shift in premyopic schoolchildren for a 1-year period. Additionally, studies have demonstrated that lower concentrations of atropine (0.5 to 0.01%) have been associated with fewer symptoms while still controlling myopia. The effectiveness of atropine in controlling the progression of myopia has been shown to be dose-related, with lower doses having a favorable safety profile in European pediatric patients. Therefore, low-dose atropine can be considered a viable treatment option for children with or at risk of developing high myopia.",NEI
Is quarantining persons who have had contact with infected persons or who enter from high-risk areas an effective measure to reduce the number of COVID-19 infections and deaths?,Yes,"Quarantining individuals who have been in contact with infected persons or have entered from high-risk areas is an effective measure to reduce the number of COVID-19 infections and deaths. This strategy, known as reverse quarantine, aims to protect vulnerable individuals and limit the spread of the virus by minimizing human contact. By implementing isolation, contact tracing, and quarantine, it is possible to decrease and delay the burden of the ongoing epidemic. These traditional public health measures remain the most effective tools in controlling outbreaks, especially in the absence of an effective therapy or vaccine. Simulation-based models of viral transmission have demonstrated the efficacy of such interventions in controlling local COVID-19 outbreaks. However, it is important to note that the success of these measures depends on the rigorous implementation and adherence to public health guidelines by individuals.",Yes
Can homeopathic globules protect against infection with the novel coronavirus?,No,"Justification: The context does not provide evidence to support the claim that homeopathic globules can protect against infection with the novel coronavirus. Instead, it discusses the use of conserved coronavirus proteins as a strategy for generating live attenuated vaccine strains against current and future coronaviruses. The context also mentions the development of influenza virus-like particles containing hemagglutinin, which have been shown to induce protection against homologous strains. Additionally, it highlights the potential for 2'O methyltransferase attenuation as a major component of future live attenuated coronavirus vaccines. However, there is no mention of homeopathic globules or any other alternative medicine approach being effective against coronavirus infection. Therefore, based on the information provided, it is not possible to conclude that homeopathic globules can protect against infection with the novel coronavirus.",NEI
Does the osteoporosis drug teriparatide increase the risk of bone cancer as a side effect?,Yes,"Teriparatide, an osteoporosis treatment drug, has been shown to increase the incidence of bone neoplasms, such as osteosarcoma, in Fischer 344 (F344) and Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats when administered subcutaneously for a long term. The development of osteosarcoma in SD rats was found to be dose-dependent and related to the duration of treatment. Rat studies using 3-60 times the approved human dose have also demonstrated an association between teriparatide and an increased risk of osteosarcoma. These findings suggest that teriparatide may increase the risk of bone cancer as a side effect. However, it is important to note that the non-carcinogenic dose level following 2-year daily administration has not been established, and adequate clinical trials have not yet been conducted to assess the efficacy of teriparatide for reducing the risk of hip fracture.",NEI
Can therapy with EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing) alleviate the symptoms of people with post-traumatic stress disorder?,Yes,"Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) therapy is an evidence-based, effective treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). EMDR targets emotionally disturbing visual memories of traumatic life events and has been widely recognized as an efficacious treatment for PTSD. It involves a procedure where the individual makes saccadic eye movements while imagining the traumatic event, which can ameliorate the symptoms of PTSD. EMDR is a well-established, innovative, and integrative psychotherapy approach that has demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of PTSD through several randomized controlled trials. It is becoming a recognized and accepted form of psychotherapy for PTSD, and can also be useful in treating trauma-associated symptoms in patients with comorbid psychiatric disorders.",Yes
"Does EMDR work similarly to exposure therapy, another well-studied form of psychotherapy for the symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder???",Yes,"Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) and exposure therapy are both effective treatments for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). While they have distinct therapeutic approaches, they share similarities in their ability to target and alleviate PTSD symptoms. EMDR employs bilateral stimulation, such as eye movements or tapping, to help patients process traumatic memories, while exposure therapy focuses on gradually exposing patients to anxiety-provoking stimuli to reduce fear and avoidance. Both therapies aim to facilitate adaptive processing of traumatic memories and promote emotional regulation. The available evidence suggests that EMDR and exposure therapy are equally efficacious in treating PTSD, with EMDR showing some advantages in reducing intrusion and arousal symptoms.",Yes
Does filling with hydrogel help with chronic back pain caused by a worn disc?,Yes,"The scientific literature suggests that hydrogel implantation can potentially aid in the restoration of nondegenerative disc mechanics, which may contribute to the reduction of chronic back pain caused by a worn disc. Studies have shown that high-density collagen hydrogels can maintain their presence in the defect under loading and positively contribute to the mechanical response of damaged discs. Furthermore, the intradiscal application of cross-linked hyaluronate hydrogel or cross-linked chondroitin sulfate hydrogel has been found to inhibit the degenerative cascade of the disc. In patients who have increased pain after intervertebral hydrogel implantation and develop a neurological deficit, the migration of the applied material into the spinal canal should be considered. However, the use of absorbable gel temporarily separating disc remnants, muscle or bone structures from the nerve roots could reduce the amount of scar tissue surrounding the nerve, reduce tethering and therefore pain, improve outcomes and facilitate revision surgery. Overall, tissue engineering offers a paradigm shift in the treatment of back pain, and hydrogel implantation is a promising approach for restoring the mechanical function of injured discs.",NEI
Does taking hyaluronic acid in capsule form improve the symptoms of knee osteoarthritis?,NEI,"The context provided discusses the effects of intra-articular hyaluronic acid injections for knee osteoarthritis.

Compared to placebo, PEMF therapy has demonstrated a beneficial effect on pain, stiffness, and physical function in patients with OA. This therapy aims to improve symptoms and quality of life (QOL) in patients with OA. While the effectiveness of PEMF therapy is still controversial, evidence suggests that it can noticeably improve pain and potentially improve mobility and QOL in sufferers. Other treatments such as joint replacement, regular physical activity, mobilization with movement (MWM), and muscle strengthening exercises have also been shown to improve pain, physical function, and QOL in patients with OA. However, the long-term efficacy of pharmacological treatments such as corticosteroids is limited. Acupuncture can also benefit patients with knee OA by providing pain relief and improving joint function.",NEI
Does oil pulling promote dental health?,Yes,"Justification: Oil pulling has been identified as a potential adjunct to regular oral hygiene practices for improving oral health and dental hygiene. The practice involves swishing oil in the mouth and has been used extensively as a traditional Indian folk remedy for strengthening teeth, gums, and jaws, as well as preventing decay, oral malodor, bleeding gums, dryness of the throat, and cracked lips. Limited evidence suggests that oil pulling with coconut oil may have a beneficial effect on oral health and dental hygiene, particularly in controlling plaque levels. Oil pulling therapy has been shown to reduce the plaque index, modified gingival scores, and total colony count of aerobic microorganisms in the plaque of adolescents with plaque-induced gingivitis. Furthermore, oil pulling with sesame oil and sunflower oil has been found to reduce plaque-related gingivitis. While further studies are needed to determine the level of effectiveness, there are clear indications of possible saponification and emulsification processes that enhance the mechanical cleaning action of oil pulling.",NEI
Can injecting stem cells into the knee joint relieve pain and limitations associated with osteoarthritis?,Yes,"The intra-articular injection of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) has been shown to be a safe and effective therapeutic alternative for the treatment of severe knee osteoarthritis (OA). MSCs, due to their marked disease-modifying ability and chondrogenic potential, are emerging as an attractive option for OA of the knee joint. They can serve as a source of newly formed cartilage and also inhibit inflammation with their immunomodulatory capacities. In a preclinical model of OA, stempeucel® significantly reduced pain and repaired damaged articular cartilage in rats. Intra-articular injections of stromal vascular fraction (SVF) have been shown to significantly decrease knee OA symptoms and pain for at least 12 months. However, due to the lack of high-quality evidence and the large degree of heterogeneity in study designs and measured outcomes, the use of platelet-rich plasma or mesenchymal stem cell therapy to treat knee OA cannot be recommended at this time. Nonetheless, the available evidence suggests that injecting stem cells into the knee joint can relieve pain and limitations associated with osteoarthritis.",NEI
Can an extract of Desmodium promote liver health or relieve other ailments?,Yes,"Scientific studies have shown that plant extracts can provide nutritional and medicinal support for liver disease, and have been used for the treatment of numerous liver disorders. One such plant extract is dihydromyricetin (DHM), which has been found to significantly ameliorate liver injury and suppress the production of inflammatory cytokines in concanavalin A-induced hepatitis. Similarly, the extract of Hovenia dulcis seeds has been shown to attenuate alcohol-induced oxidative liver injury, reducing serum alanine and aspartate aminotransferases, alkaline phosphatase, and triglyceride, while elevating hepatic glutathione and increasing activities of superoxide dismutase and catalase. These findings suggest that plant extracts, including Desmodium, may have hepatoprotective effects and could potentially promote liver health or relieve other ailments.",NEI

The extract has also been shown to improve learning and memory, with statistically significant improvement seen in tests relating to cognitive functions. Bacopa is also known to have a neuroprotective effect against mental diseases such as depression, anxiety, and Alzheimer's disease. Furthermore, pathway analysis using the Ingenuity platform suggested that Bacopa may protect against brain damage and improve brain development. Bacopa is also known as a natural antioxidant, which may give details its neuroprotective role seen in the memory centers of the brain. In summary, the context suggests that taking Bacopa extract can improve memory performance.",No
"Do remedies containing the trifoliate fruit alleviate the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis (""rheumatism"")?",Yes,"The context suggests that remedies containing the trifoliate fruit may alleviate the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis. The fruit Choerospondias axillaris, also known as trifoliate fruit, has been observed to have anti-inflammatory effects on inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. This is supported by scientific evidence that traditional medicaments exert beneficial effects on rheumatoid arthritis through several cellular mechanisms, including downregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-6, and NF-κB, suppression of oxidative stress, inhibition of cartilage degradation with destructive metalloproteinases, and enhancement of antioxidant performance. The study demonstrates the antiarthritic activity of the trifoliate fruit and validates its traditional use for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.",Yes
Does thyme strengthen memory or prevent mental decline?,Yes,", with a caveat

Recent research has suggested that thymic functions, particularly in the context of thymic peptides, play an important role in aging and immune regulation. Small-scale intervention trials have indicated that short-term supplementation of thymic derivatives may partially reverse cognitive deficits in elderly men with and without dementia. Furthermore, the restoration of thymic functions and thymic re-growth in old mice has been achieved through endocrinological or nutritional interventions, such as melatonin, arginine, or zinc. This suggests that age-related alterations in neuroendocrine-thymus interactions contribute to thymic involution, which is central to the decline in immune system function that occurs with age. Consequently, there is a clinical need for strategies that can boost thymic function and enhance T cell immunity. While thyme, the herb, is not explicitly mentioned in the context, it contains various compounds, including zinc, which could potentially contribute to the aforementioned mechanisms. However, further research is needed to establish a direct link between thyme and memory strengthening or mental decline prevention.",NEI
"Does regular consumption of chia seeds reduce body weight, blood sugar levels or cholesterol?",Yes,"Evidence suggests that regular consumption of chia seeds may contribute to a significant but discrete reduction in body weight and waist circumference, as well as improve lipid profiles, particularly in individuals with abnormal initial values. Chia seeds are rich in dietary fiber, protein, and alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), which may promote weight loss and enhance blood glucose and lipid profiles. Studies have shown that chia seed supplementation can lead to a significant intragroup reduction in body weight, with a greater reduction observed among obese individuals compared to overweight individuals. However, it is important to note that the evidence regarding the relationship between chia seed consumption and cardiovascular risk factors is still insufficient, and further research is needed to confirm these findings.",No
Do heat patches that heat themselves or heat pads help with pain in the neck?,Yes,"The application of heat, whether through self-heating patches or heat pads, has been shown to provide mild yet significant improvement in pain severity for acute neck or back strain. This is supported by a study that compared the analgesic efficacy of heat and cold in relieving pain from back and neck strains. The study found that the effect of local heat applied to trigger points significantly improved pain relief in the neck and plantar fascia. Furthermore, high-level pulsed heat at 45°C produced significantly more analgesia compared to steady heat at 37°C. It is important to note that the optimal temperature and duration of heat application remain factors that require further investigation. Nonetheless, heat therapy is a commonly accepted method of pain relief and is recommended as a first-line therapy in many clinical guidelines.",NEI
Do heat patches containing capsaicin help with neck pain???,Yes,"Capsaicin, a primary compound found in chili peppers, has been shown to decrease sensitivity to pain produced by sharp mechanical stimuli and nearly eliminate heat-evoked pain within the injected area. Repeated topical application of capsaicin has resulted in reduced sensation to mechanical, heat, and cold pain without changing non-painful tactile sensation. As a topical agent, capsaicin reportedly blocks pain without otherwise impairing sensation. It has been used as an external analgesic for temporary relief of neuralgia and as a research tool to study peripheral pain. Topical capsaicin selectively impairs heat sensitivity without any concomitant changes in cold sensitivity, making it a recommended treatment for a variety of painful syndromes. Capsaicin has been successful for pain relief in postherpetic neuralgia, arthritis, and diabetic neuropathy. Localized neuropathic pain can be relieved following the topical application of high-concentration capsaicin. For these reasons, application of capsaicin to the skin has been used for a variety of painful syndromes, including neck pain.",No
Do heat patches help with lower back pain?,Yes,"Evidence suggests that heat therapy, such as heat patches, can provide pain relief for individuals with acute and sub-acute low-back pain. A trial involving 90 participants demonstrated that a heated blanket significantly decreased acute low-back pain immediately after application. Additionally, a study of 258 participants with a mix of acute and sub-acute low-back pain found that heat wrap therapy significantly reduced pain after five days compared to oral placebo. Furthermore, there is moderate evidence from a small number of trials that heat wrap therapy provides a small short-term reduction in pain and disability in a population with a mix of acute and sub-acute low-back pain. However, the effectiveness of heat therapy for chronic low-back pain is less clear, and more high-quality randomized controlled trials are needed to establish the optimal temperature, duration, and onset of heat therapy for chronic low-back pain.",Yes
Does ginger help with period pain?,NEI,"The provided context does not explicitly discuss the effect of ginger on period pain. However, it does mention several studies demonstrating ginger's anti-inflammatory and antinociceptive effects, as well as its ability to reduce muscle pain and inflammation in various contexts. Ginger has been shown to be effective in relieving pain caused by diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D) and osteoarthritis, and it has been used traditionally to alleviate nausea, arthritis, and pain. Additionally, ginger has been evaluated as a safe and effective treatment for nausea and vomiting during pregnancy. While these findings suggest that ginger may have potential benefits for managing period pain, further research is needed to establish its efficacy and safety in this specific context.",Yes
"Can the state of health be assessed as reliably with a ""cell check"" analysis as with other diagnostic tests (for example, blood or urine analyses)?",NEI,"Justification: The context does not provide specific information on the ""cell check"" analysis and its diagnostic capabilities compared to other tests such as blood or urine analyses. Generally, the performance of a diagnostic test is evaluated by comparing its outcome to the patient's true disease state, and this can be done using statistical measures that quantify the diagnostic ability of the test. The reliability of tumor biomarkers in diagnosing cancer in asymptomatic patients is a frequently asked question, and monitoring health conditions is essential for early detection of diseases. However, without specific information on the ""cell check"" analysis, it is not possible to determine whether it can assess the state of health as reliably as other diagnostic tests. Combining tests may be the optimal methodology for determining the disease status of a patient, and the performance of additional tests can assist in arriving at a correct diagnosis. However, the influence of clinical conditions on the accuracy of these assays is not well-known.",NEI
Can pain from osteoarthritis (joint wear) be relieved by arnica ointment or arnica gel?,Yes,"Arnica preparations, specifically in gel form, have been clinically proven to be effective in relieving pain from osteoarthritis in the interphalangeal joints of the hands. A randomized, double-blind study involving 204 patients with radiologically confirmed and symptomatically active osteoarthritis demonstrated that arnica gel was not inferior to ibuprofen in terms of pain relief and hand function after 21 days of treatment. The efficacy of arnica is believed to be due to its anti-inflammatory properties and inhibition of the transcription factor NF-kappab. Additionally, arnica preparations have been shown to suppress MMP1 and MMP13 mRNA levels in bovine and human articular chondrocytes, further supporting its potential as an anti-inflammatory/analgesic in osteoarthritis.",Yes
Can pain from a sprained ankle be relieved by arnica ointment or arnica gel?,NEI,"The context provided does not explicitly mention the use of arnica ointment or arnica gel for relieving pain from a sprained ankle. However, it does mention the use of traumeel ointment and traumeel gel, which are herbal remedies similar to arnica, and diclofenac gel, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), for pain relief in acute ankle sprains. The study found that traumeel ointment and traumeel gel decreased pain and improved joint function to the same extent as diclofenac gel in acute ankle sprains. While this does not provide direct evidence for the use of arnica ointment or gel, it suggests that herbal remedies may be effective in managing pain from ankle sprains. Further research is needed to determine the efficacy of arnica specifically for this purpose.",NEI
Can sore muscles be relieved by arnica ointment or arnica gel?,No,"The clinical efficacy of arnica, in high potency (200c) or topical formulations, has not been substantiated in moderating delayed onset muscle soreness and accompanying symptoms of muscle dysfunction. In fact, rather than decreasing leg pain, arnica was found to increase leg pain 24 hours after eccentric calf exercises. Pain scores on legs treated with arnica were higher than scores on those receiving placebo 24 hours after exercise. Furthermore, studies have shown that topical arnica ointment after upper blepharoplasty does not improve postoperative outcome, and there was no difference in muscle tenderness between arnica and placebo. Therefore, it can be concluded that sore muscles cannot be relieved by arnica ointment or arnica gel.",No
Can carbon dioxide in mineral water and other sparkling drinks damage teeth or cause tooth decay?,Yes,"Carbon dioxide in mineral water and other sparkling drinks can indeed contribute to dental erosion and potentially tooth decay. This is primarily due to the presence of carbonic acid, which is formed when carbon dioxide dissolves in water. The acidic nature of carbonated beverages, including mineral water, can lead to the erosion of the enamel surface and cementum of both deciduous and permanent teeth. Continuous consumption of these beverages can cause irreversible damage to the tooth structure. Furthermore, the low pH of many commonly consumed beverages, including carbonated drinks, has been found to be potentially erosive to the dentition. It is important to note that protective mechanisms exist in the oral cavity to neutralize these acids, but their effectiveness can be overwhelmed by frequent and prolonged exposure to acidic substances.",NEI
"Does bark extract from maritime pine (also: ""pine bark extract"") improve the symptoms of osteoarthritis?",Yes,"The bark extract from maritime pine, also known as pine bark extract, has been found to improve symptoms of osteoarthritis. The extract contains compounds such as procyanidins, which have reported protective effects against disease. Clinical studies have demonstrated that supplementation with the pine bark extract (Pycnogenol) alleviates symptomatic effects in patients suffering from moderate forms of knee osteoarthritis. This is achieved through the inhibition of cartilage-destructing proteases and pain-producing cyclo-oxygenases, leading to relief from pain, improvement of stiffness, enhanced mobility, and overall well-being. Furthermore, the extract exerts antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, and chondroprotective effects in vitro and in vivo, providing a basis for its use in managing osteoarthritis symptoms.",NEI
"Is brown millet effective in favorably influencing the course of the disease in rheumatism (""rheumatoid arthritis"")?",NEI,"The provided context does not contain information regarding the effectiveness of brown millet in treating rheumatoid arthritis.

Further research and evidence are required to assess the potential benefits of brown millet in managing rheumatoid arthritis symptoms.",NEI
Are cannabis or substances derived from cannabis effective and safe anti-cancer agents?,NEI,"(Not Enough Information)

While preclinical studies have demonstrated anti-neoplastic effects of cannabinoids in various cancer cells and animal models, the clinical evidence supporting the use of cannabis or cannabis-derived substances as effective and safe anti-cancer agents is currently insufficient. The available literature on the use of cannabis and cannabinoid-based medicines in palliative oncology primarily focuses on the management of cancer-related symptoms, rather than the treatment of cancer itself. Although cannabis and its derivatives, such as delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ(9)-THC) and cannabidiol (CBD), have shown potential in preclinical studies, further clinical research is needed to establish their efficacy and safety as anti-cancer agents. It is important to consider the possible adverse effects of these compounds and to provide evidence-based recommendations for their use in cancer-related symptoms. Quality-controlled herbal cannabis, when used by patients with experience of cannabis use as part of a monitored treatment program, appears to have a reasonable safety profile. However, caution is advised with sustained use of such preparations, and it remains unclear whether there is any advantage in using cannabis extracts compared with isolated Δ(9)-THC. In summary, while cannabis and its derivatives hold promise for the treatment of cancer, more research is needed to determine their effectiveness and safety as anti-cancer agents.",NEI
It is not always possible to reduce elevated cholesterol levels to a healthy level with tablets and thus minimize the risk of heart attack or stroke. Does this succeed through additional injections with PCSK9 antibodies?,Yes,"Recent studies have shown that monoclonal antibodies to PCSK9 significantly reduce LDL-cholesterol levels, with reductions ranging from 30-65% in patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia or statin intolerance. PCSK9 inhibitors have also been associated with a statistically significant reduction in death for any cause and a favorable trend for cardiovascular events. Furthermore, PCSK9 inhibitors have been shown to be effective in optimizing plasma LDL-c values and reducing CV event risk, even in patients who are not satisfactorily managed with statins. While fixed-dose combinations of hypolipidemic agents may provide an attractive option for the effective and safe management of hypercholesterolemia, PCSK9 inhibitors represent a novel and promising approach to reducing LDL-c levels using a mechanism at the LDL receptor level. Therefore, additional injections with PCSK9 antibodies may indeed succeed in reducing elevated cholesterol levels to a healthy level and minimize the risk of heart attack or stroke.",Yes
Do vaginal suppositories containing the active ingredient imiquimod cause precancerous stages of cervical cancer to recede or disappear?,Yes,"Imiquimod, when applied topically, has been demonstrated to reduce human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, which is strongly related to cervical cancer. The use of imiquimod 5% cream has been shown to be effective in the regression of vulvar and vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN and VAIN), which are precancerous conditions. In a study, 58 of the 76 patients (76.3%) were clear of HPV infection and had normal pap smears after administration of imiquimod cream. The topical application of imiquimod aims at the immunologic eradication of HPV-infected cells, making it an alternative approach for the treatment of HPV-positive VIN and VAIN. Therefore, it can be inferred that vaginal suppositories containing the active ingredient imiquimod may cause precancerous stages of cervical cancer to recede or disappear.",Yes
Is blue light treatment as effective as UV light or other established therapies for psoriasis?,NEI,"The efficacy of blue light treatment for psoriasis has been demonstrated in clinical investigations, as it reduces the proliferation of keratinocytes and modulates T-cell immune response. Blue light therapy has been shown to reduce the severity of psoriasis vulgaris in two clinical trials and is suitable for treating chronic skin inflammation, including psoriasis. However, the context does not provide direct comparison with UV light or other established therapies for psoriasis. While blue light therapy has been proven effective in treating acne vulgaris and offers an alternative to clinicians, the context does not provide sufficient information to definitively state that blue light treatment is as effective as UV light or other established therapies for psoriasis. Further research and direct comparison studies are needed to determine the relative efficacy of blue light treatment for psoriasis.",NEI
Does frequent consumption of potatoes increase the risk of dying from cancer?,Yes,"Evidence suggests that frequent consumption of potatoes, particularly fried potatoes, may be associated with an increased risk of mortality. Studies have shown that high potato consumption is linked to a higher risk of colorectal cancer (CRC), with a hazard ratio of 1.32 (95% CI: 1.10, 1.60) for consuming three or more potatoes per day compared to 0-7 potatoes per week. Additionally, subgroup analyses have indicated that participants who consumed fried potatoes two to three times per week and three or more times per week were at an increased risk of mortality. While the association between potato consumption and pancreatic cancer was not consistently significant, the findings support the hypothesis that frequent potato consumption may increase the risk of dying from cancer.",No

However, it does not mention dark field analysis or dark field microscopy as a method for cancer detection in blood. Given the lack of information regarding this specific technique, it is not possible to definitively state whether cancer can be detected by dark field analysis of the blood. Further research and evidence would be required to accurately assess the potential of this method for cancer detection.",No
Can dark field analysis indicate other health problems?,Yes,"Dark field analysis, a method used in microscopy, can indeed provide insights into various health conditions. This technique allows for the examination of unstained specimens, which can reveal the presence of certain microorganisms, cells, or cellular components that are not visible under normal light conditions. For instance, the presence of certain bacteria, fungi, or parasites can be detected using dark field analysis. Additionally, abnormalities in cell structure or function, such as those seen in certain types of cancer or immune disorders, can also be identified. However, it is important to note that dark field analysis is just one tool among many in the diagnostic arsenal, and its results should be interpreted in conjunction with other clinical findings and laboratory tests.",NEI
Does kombucha have a positive effect on health?,Yes,"Kombucha, a fermented tea drink, has been shown to exhibit health-promoting properties. Its high antioxidant potential, derived from the activity of a consortium of acetic acid bacteria and osmophilic yeast, contributes to its ability to act in health prophylaxis and recovery. The four main properties of kombucha that support its health benefits are detoxification, antioxidation, energizing potencies, and promotion of depressed immunity. These properties have been associated with the prevention of a broad spectrum of metabolic and infectious diseases. However, it is important to note that while personal experiences and testimonials support these claims, more scientific evidence is needed to validate the beneficial effects of kombucha.",NEI
Is graviola an effective and safe treatment for cancer?,NEI,"(Not Enough Information)

Based on the available information, it cannot be definitively concluded that graviola is an effective and safe treatment for cancer. While in vitro studies have demonstrated anticancer effects of graviola, there is a lack of human data to support its efficacy and safety. The use of graviola as a cancer treatment is often promoted based on traditional use and in vitro studies, but more research is needed to establish its effectiveness and safety in humans. It is important to note that the absence of human data does not necessarily mean that graviola is ineffective or unsafe, but rather that more research is needed to make a definitive conclusion.",NEI
Does taking preparations with fenugreek extract improve sex life or satisfaction with it?,Yes,"The context suggests that fenugreek extract has a significant effect on total serum testosterone levels in males. Testosterone is a hormone that plays a crucial role in male sexual function, including libido and erectile function. Clinical trials have indicated that fenugreek extract supplementation can improve aging male symptoms, health-related quality of life, grip strength, and anxiety. Furthermore, different types of glycosides extract of fenugreek have shown androgenic and anabolic effects in males. These findings suggest that fenugreek extract may have a positive impact on male sexual health and satisfaction. However, it is essential to note that more research is needed to confirm these effects, particularly in younger and older populations.",NEI
Does disulfiram improve the effectiveness of chemotherapy for cancer?,Yes,"Disulfiram has been indicated to improve the efficacy of many cancer drugs, including chemotherapy. In combination with copper, disulfiram has been reported to override drug resistance in cancer cells. Furthermore, disulfiram combined with chemotherapy based on the microtubule inhibitor vinorelbine appears to prolong survival in non-small cell lung cancer patients. Previous studies have also shown that disulfiram is cytotoxic to cancer cell lines and reverses anticancer drug resistance. Therefore, it can be concluded that disulfiram has the potential to improve the effectiveness of chemotherapy for cancer.",NEI
Can binaural beats relieve stress or anxiety before surgery and medical treatments?,Yes,"Evidence suggests that binaural beats can indeed relieve stress or anxiety before surgery and medical treatments. Several studies have reported that listening to binaural beats may exert an acute influence on both low-frequency (LF) and high-frequency (HF) components of heart rate variability (HRV) and may increase subjective feelings of relaxation. Furthermore, binaural-beat exposure has been shown to result in greater self-reported relaxation, increased parasympathetic activation, and increased sympathetic withdrawal compared to a placebo visit. The application of auditory beat stimulation has been speculated to provide a promising new tool with which to alleviate symptoms of anxiety and enhance cognition. Moreover, background music, including binaural beats, has been found to decrease levels of state anxiety irrespective of age, sex, and previous exposure to surgery or anesthesia. Therefore, the use of binaural beats as a means of reducing stress or anxiety before surgery and medical treatments is supported by the available evidence.",NEI
Is a vegan diet healthier than a vegetarian diet?,Inconclusive,"The available evidence suggests that both vegan and vegetarian diets have potential health benefits. Vegan diets tend to contain less saturated fat and cholesterol and more dietary fiber than vegetarian diets. They also have a lower fat content and a higher polyunsaturated:saturated fatty acid ratio than omnivorous diets. However, vegans may have particularly low intakes of vitamin B12 and calcium. In contrast, vegetarian diets are usually rich in carbohydrates, n-6 fatty acids, dietary fiber, carotenoids, folic acid, vitamin C, vitamin E, and magnesium, but relatively low in protein, saturated fat, long-chain n-3 fatty acids, retinol, vitamin B12, and zinc. Vegetarian diets are also associated with lower intakes of energy, saturated fatty acids, and animal protein and higher intakes of fiber and phytochemicals compared to omnivorous diets. Cross-sectional studies have shown that vegetarians and vegans have a relatively low BMI and a low plasma cholesterol concentration, but higher plasma homocysteine concentrations than non-vegetarians. However, the health benefits of a well-planned vegetarian diet far outweigh the potential risks from the public health viewpoint. Therefore, it is inconclusive whether a vegan diet is healthier than a vegetarian diet.",NEI
Can taking chlorophyll change mouth or body odor?,Yes,"Based on the available information, it can be inferred that chlorophyll has the potential to change mouth or body odor. Chlorophyllin, a derivative of chlorophyll, has been shown to exhibit antimicrobial activity against several types of bacteria, including staphylococci, listeria monocytogenes, and citrobacter freundii. This suggests that chlorophyllin may be able to alter the composition of the microbiota in the mouth and on the skin, which could in turn affect the production of odor-causing compounds. Additionally, chlorophyllin has been shown to have anti-inflammatory effects, which could potentially reduce the production of volatile compounds that contribute to body odor. However, further research is needed to confirm these potential effects and determine the optimal dosage and duration of chlorophyll supplementation for improving mouth and body odor.",NEI
Can taking chlorophyll affect the odor of urine in catheter wearers or stool in people with an artificial bowel outlet?,NEI,"Justification: The context does not provide direct evidence on the effects of chlorophyll consumption on urine or stool odor in catheter wearers or individuals with an artificial bowel outlet.

Can a straight bar improve harmless tension and pain in the neck and back?,Yes,"Theoretical evaluation suggests that the shape of a bar can enhance gripping comfort and increase muscular endurance, which can potentially alleviate harmless tension and pain in the neck and back. Furthermore, the application of double bars has been shown to lessen the common tendency for hyperextension of the neck and the use of the lower back as a major joint in sitting and standing, thereby reducing stress on the thoraces. The use of a newly designed massage instrument, the hand grip T-bar (HT-bar), has also been suggested to be beneficial in relieving chronic non-specific low back pain through deep cross-friction massage. However, it is important to note that the effectiveness of a straight bar in improving harmless tension and pain in the neck and back may depend on individual factors such as the specific cause of the tension or pain and the individual's anatomy and physiology. Therefore, further research is needed to confirm the efficacy of a straight bar in improving harmless tension and pain in the neck and back.",NEI
Are ultrasound examinations during pregnancy safe for the health of the child?,NEI,"The safety of ultrasound examinations during pregnancy for the health of the child remains an area of ongoing research and discussion. While ultrasound is a common and essential imaging tool for evaluating fetal and maternal conditions during pregnancy, and is currently the modality of choice for fetal examination, the potential risks and benefits must be better understood before it can be definitively concluded that ultrasound is safe for the health of the child. While some studies have demonstrated that ultrasound examinations during pregnancy increased the risk of undesirable developmental outcomes, other studies have found no adverse effects. Therefore, more research is needed to fully understand the potential risks and benefits of ultrasound examinations during pregnancy.",Yes
Can oregano oil relieve discomfort or disease?,Yes,"The scientific literature suggests that oregano oil, derived from the herb Origanum vulgare L., possesses various medicinal properties. Its traditional use in folk medicine for alleviating inflammation-related diseases, respiratory and digestive disorders, headaches, rheumatism, and diabetes has been supported by recent studies. The oil exhibits remarkable antioxidant activity, which can help prevent damage caused by free radicals in the body. Furthermore, it has been shown to have antibacterial activity against bacteria associated with food poisoning. Notably, oregano oil has demonstrated anti-inflammatory efficacy by inhibiting soybean lipoxygenase, suggesting its potential for managing inflammatory conditions. The health benefits of oregano oil are partially attributed to its polyphenolic content, including flavonoids and phenolic acids. However, it is essential to note that while these findings are promising, further investigation is required to fully understand the mechanisms involved and establish the safety and efficacy of oregano oil for specific medical conditions.",NEI
Are Bach flower remedies effective in helping with test anxiety?,Yes,", with limitations

Bach flower remedies have been found to be effective in reducing anxiety levels, as evidenced by a decrease in state and trait anxiety scores in posttest study phases compared to pretest (p < 0.005). However, it is important to note that their efficacy is primarily as a placebo for test anxiety, as they do not have a specific effect. The use of Bach flower remedies has been associated with positive emotional changes in the majority of clients, and they are thought to help balance emotional state. Although many botanicals have been proposed as remedies for anxiety symptoms, there has been a paucity of controlled trials of these remedies. It is also worth noting that three RCTs of BFRs for students with examination anxiety and one RCT of BFRs for children with ADHD showed no overall benefit in comparison to placebo. Therefore, while Bach flower remedies may be effective in helping with test anxiety, their specific effects and mechanisms of action require further investigation.",No
Can capsules with diamine oxidase alleviate or prevent symptoms of histamine intolerance?,Yes,"The oral administration of diamine oxidase (DAO) has been shown to significantly reduce histamine-associated symptoms compared to placebo (p = 0.014). Diamine oxidase is the main enzyme responsible for the metabolism of ingested histamine, and a deficiency in this enzyme can lead to histamine intolerance, a disorder in the homeostasis of histamine. Treatment of food histaminosis using a combination of vegetal DAO and catalase has been suggested to protect against histamine toxicity and prevent H2O2-induced damage that may occur during histamine oxidative deamination. Furthermore, a low-histamine diet and oral DAO supplementation have been shown to enhance intestinal histamine degradation and alleviate symptoms of histamine intolerance. Therefore, capsules with diamine oxidase can alleviate or prevent symptoms of histamine intolerance.",NEI
Does magnesium help with period pain?,NEI,"(Not Enough Information)

Based on the available information, it is not possible to definitively conclude whether magnesium helps with period pain. While magnesium has been shown to have analgesic properties and has been used to alleviate pain in various conditions such as migraines and surgical procedures, there is no direct evidence to suggest its effectiveness in managing period pain. Additionally, the role of magnesium in treating acute myocardial infarction has been controversial, further highlighting the need for more research to establish its potential benefits in managing period pain.",NEI
"Does cannabis improve symptoms of Parkinson's disease, for example movement disorders?",Yes,"Evidence from a clinical study suggests that cannabis consumption significantly improved the mean (sd) total score on the motor Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale from 33.1 (13.8) at baseline to 23.2 (10.5) after consumption (t = 5.9; p < 0.001). This indicates that cannabis may have a beneficial effect on motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease, including movement disorders. However, more research is needed to fully understand the potential benefits and limitations of cannabis use in Parkinson's disease and to establish its long-term effects.",NEI
Is the dietary supplement nattokinase effective and safe as a blood thinner?,Yes,", with caveats

Nattokinase, a potent fibrinolytic protease derived from the Japanese traditional food natto, has been shown to reduce certain factors of blood clotting, including fibrinogen, factor VII, and factor VIII, in both healthy and cardiovascular groups. This indicates its potential as a dietary supplement for cardiovascular health and as a thrombolytic agent. However, its safety and efficacy as a blood thinner for all individuals, especially those with specific medical conditions, requires further investigation. It is also important to note that nattokinase should not be used as a substitute for warfarin after valve replacement, as it has been documented to lead to thrombus formation. Therefore, while nattokinase may be effective and safe as a blood thinner for certain individuals, it is crucial to consult with a healthcare provider before using it as a replacement for prescribed medications.",NEI
"Is the Feldenkrais Method effective against pain and tension in the neck, shoulders and back?",Yes,"The Feldenkrais Method has shown efficacy in alleviating pain and tension in the neck, shoulders, and back. Studies have reported that patients undergoing the Feldenkrais Method experienced significantly less pain than controls, as measured by the Vas and Visual, Musculoskeletal, and Balance Complaints Questionnaire ratings at post-treatment follow-up and 1-year follow-up. The method has been found to be an effective intervention for chronic neck and scapular pain in patients with visual impairment. Furthermore, the Feldenkrais Method has been shown to change muscle tone, leading to a more relaxed supine position, and has demonstrated comparable efficacy to core stability exercises for nonspecific chronic low back pain. The method has also been associated with increased benefits in improving quality of life, interoceptive awareness, and reducing disability index. However, it should be noted that while improvements have been observed with Feldenkrais interventions, these improvements are not as large as suggested by anecdotal claims.",NEI
Does an alkaline bath help with neurodermatitis?,NEI,"The context does not provide sufficient information to definitively determine whether an alkaline bath is beneficial for neurodermatitis. The study primarily focuses on the effects of tap water bathing and bath products on atopic dermatitis (AD), not specifically addressing alkaline baths or neurodermatitis. The results suggest that bathing can improve skin barrier function and dry skin symptoms in AD patients, but the effects of alkaline baths on neurodermatitis remain unclear. Further research is needed to establish the efficacy of alkaline baths in managing neurodermatitis.",NEI
"Does birch water, also called birch sap, help with health problems?",Yes,"Birch water, or sap, has been shown to have potential health benefits, although the existing information on its chemical composition and pharmacological effects is still insufficient. It is known that birch trees synthesize a wide range of secondary metabolites with pharmacological significance. In traditional medicine, birch buds have been used as a diuretic, diaphoretic, antiseptic, anti-inflammatory, and analgesic agent. Additionally, birch bud extracts have demonstrated time- and concentration-dependent and differential cytotoxicity, suggesting their potential as a source of compounds with cytotoxic activity against various cancers. Balneotherapy, which involves immersion in mineral-medicinal water and the application of mud, has been shown to have anti-inflammatory, analgesic, antioxidant, chondroprotective, and anabolic effects. These effects are thought to be mediated by neuroendocrine and immunological responses, including both humoral and cell-mediated immunity. Therefore, it is possible that birch water may have similar health benefits, although further research is needed to confirm this.",NEI
Is oolong tea an effective way to lose weight?,Yes,"Scientific studies have shown that oolong tea may be an effective way to lose weight. The anti-obesity effects of oolong tea have been demonstrated in several studies, which have evaluated the effects of oolong tea extracts on obesity. Oolong tea has been found to decrease body fat content and reduce body weight through improving lipid metabolism. Chronic consumption of oolong tea may prevent against obesity. The specific anti-obesity capabilities of oolong tea polysaccharide (tps) and tea polyphenols (tpp) have been investigated in high-fat diet-induced rats. Oolong tea extract has been shown to inhibit pancreatic lipase activity, which may contribute to its anti-obesity effects. Additionally, consumption of oolong tea for the longest duration was found to be associated with lower blood total cholesterol, TAG, and LDL-cholesterol levels. These findings suggest that oolong tea may be an effective crude drug for the treatment of obesity and fatty liver caused by a high-fat diet.",NEI
"Do Waveex and similar products reduce exposure to electromagnetic fields, for example when using a cell phone or smartphone?",Yes,"Recent studies have shown that mobile phone chips, such as Waveex, can significantly reduce the effects of electromagnetic fields (EMFs) emitted by mobile phone radiation on electroencephalographic (EEG) brain activity and attentional performance. These chips are designed to limit and inhibit EMFs by acting as electromagnetic shielding fabrics. Furthermore, nonwoven textile surfaces produced as conductive materials have demonstrated improved oxidant-antioxidant status and tp53 expression in electromagnetic waves exposed zebrafish embryos. This suggests that such materials may have a protective effect against the potential harm caused by EMFs. Therefore, it can be concluded that products like Waveex and similar mobile phone chips can reduce exposure to EMFs when using a cell phone or smartphone.",NEI
Can ingredients in deodorants like aluminum salts cause breast cancer?,Yes,", with caveats.

Aluminium salts, commonly found in antiperspirants, have been implicated in the development of breast cancer due to their genotoxic effects. These salts have the potential to cause DNA alterations and epigenetic effects, which could contribute to the onset of breast cancer if they occur in breast cells. The frequent application of aluminium-based antiperspirants to the underarm, a local area of the human breast, adds a significant additional exposure to this potential carcinogen. While aluminium has not been formally identified as a breast carcinogen, its widespread use in underarm cosmetics has been challenged due to the potential risks. If the use of aluminium-based antiperspirants is indeed involved in the etiology of breast cancer, reducing exposure could offer a strategy for prevention. However, further research is needed to fully understand the long-term effects of aluminium salts on breast health.",NEI
"Does the intake of black cumin improve the symptoms of asthma, e.g. shortness of breath?",Yes,"Evidence suggests that black cumin, or Nigella sativa L., possesses several medicinal properties, including bronchodilatory, anti-inflammatory, and immunopotentiating effects. The anti-inflammatory and bronchodilator effects of black cumin and its derivatives have been reported in a few clinical studies, indicating potential benefits for asthma patients. Furthermore, N. sativa supplementation, when combined with inhaled maintenance therapy, has been shown to improve some measures of pulmonary function and inflammation in partly controlled asthma. These findings suggest that black cumin intake may improve asthma symptoms, such as shortness of breath, by reducing airway inflammation and improving bronchodilation. However, more extensive clinical research is needed to fully understand and confirm the benefits of black cumin for asthma patients.",NEI
Do specially trained dogs reliably warn of dangerous hypoglycemia?,Yes,", with limitations.

Justification: Trained dogs have been observed to provide timely alerts in 36% of hypoglycemia events, indicating their ability to detect dangerous hypoglycemia. However, the reliability of these alerts is limited by a high false-positive rate, which may make it difficult to differentiate between hypo-, hyper-, and euglycemia based on a dog alert alone. The sensitivity and specificity of trained diabetes alert dogs' performance in detecting hypoglycemia have been found to vary widely, ranging from 22 to 100% and 71 to 90%, respectively. Despite these limitations, dog users have reported high levels of satisfaction and confidence in their dogs' ability to detect hypoglycemia, and the use of trained diabetes alert dogs has been suggested as a fast, versatile, and cost-effective approach for safeguarding the health of individuals with diabetes. However, further trials are needed to confirm these findings and establish the reliability of trained dogs in alerting to hypoglycemia under real-life conditions.",NEI
Does taking proton pump inhibitors (PPI) increase the risk of bone fractures?,Yes,"Evidence from epidemiological studies indicates a positive association between long-term use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and an increased risk of fractures, including vertebral, hip, and any-site fractures. Although the exact mechanism underlying this association remains unclear, PPI use has been identified as a potential risk factor for osteoporotic fractures. The risk of fracture appears to increase with the duration of PPI use, particularly when used for one year or longer and regularly in the recent year. Pooled analysis of observational studies suggests that PPI use may moderately increase the risk of hip fracture, with a relative risk of 1.26 (95% confidence interval: 1.16-1.36). Furthermore, patients who regularly use PPIs have a higher risk of osteoporotic fracture compared to those who exclusively use H2RA. These findings suggest that PPI use may impair bone quality and quantity, thereby increasing the risk of fractures.",Yes
Can matrix therapy (also: matrix rhythm therapy) alleviate complaints of muscles and joints?,Yes,"Matrix therapy, also known as matrix rhythm therapy, has been shown to alleviate complaints of muscles and joints. This innovative, minimally invasive approach in the field of regenerative medicine aims to promote tissue regeneration by reconstructing the cellular microenvironment following tissue injury. The therapy has demonstrated significant therapeutic potential in the treatment of pathologies characterized by tissue inflammation and damage, or following injury. Evidence from animal studies suggests that matrix augmentation of bone marrow stimulation can improve the quality of repair tissue formation. Furthermore, applications merging RGTA®-based matrix therapy and cell therapy, combining extra-cellular matrix reconstruction with cells required for optimal tissue repair, have shown significant promise. A significant decrease in connective tissue thickness and pain was observed in participants. Therefore, it can be concluded that matrix therapy has the potential to alleviate complaints of muscles and joints.",NEI
Can hyposensitization by injections with allergy-causing pollen components help with hay fever?,Yes,"Hyposensitization by injections with allergy-causing pollen components, also known as allergen-specific immunotherapy (SIT), has been shown to be effective for treating hay fever. This immunotherapy involves administering gradually increasing doses of the allergen, leading to a reduction in the body's allergic response over time. The mechanism of action is thought to involve the inhibition of allergen-induced T lymphocyte and eosinophil recruitment, as well as eosinophil activation in the target organ. This may occur through a protective local increase in TH1-type cells. Clinical improvement in hay fever symptoms has been observed, accompanied by a significant reduction in the immediate cutaneous response to grass pollen. The benefits of SIT include both short-term and long-term symptom relief, as well as potential prevention of exacerbation of hay fever into asthma. Future pollen vaccines may consist of hypoallergenic recombinant allergens and TH1-inducing immunostimulatory adjuvants, which could further improve the efficacy and safety of SIT. However, it is important to note that the efficacy of SIT must be balanced against possible side effects, and the therapy should be initiated preseasonally according to international guidelines.",Yes
Can hyposensitization by means of drops or tablets administered under the tongue help with hay fever?,NEI,"(Not Enough Information)

In the context of hay fever treatment, hyposensitization, also known as allergen immunotherapy, has been explored as a potential therapy. While this approach has shown promise in some patients, the use of oral hyposensitization specifically for hay fever has not been proven effective in controlled studies. The study mentioned in the context failed to demonstrate any beneficial effect of oral hyposensitization, as measured by various symptom and medication scores, nasal provocation tests, and skin prick tests. However, the context also mentions the decision to undertake controlled clinical trials to determine the safety and effectiveness of orally administered enteric-coated grass pollen tablets in patients with hay fever. Therefore, at present, there is insufficient evidence to definitively conclude whether hyposensitization by means of drops or tablets administered under the tongue can help with hay fever. Further research is needed to establish the efficacy of this treatment approach.",Yes
Do Blushwood berries help against skin cancer?,NEI,"The context provided does not explicitly mention Blushwood berries, and thus there is not enough information to definitively determine their potential effects on skin cancer. However, the context does suggest that berries in general possess properties that make them important in the prevention of cancer, including skin cancer. This is due to the presence of bioactive phytochemicals, such as polyphenols, flavonoids, and proanthocyanidins, which have been shown to have cancer preventive actions and suppressive effects in both in vitro and in vivo studies. The literature, including human studies, suggests that berry components can modulate the immune system to delay cancer development. The specific molecular mechanisms underlying the anti-cancer effects of berries are largely unknown, but they are thought to be partially mediated through their abilities to counteract, reduce, and repair damage resulting from oxidative stress and inflammation. Therefore, while there is not enough information to specifically address the effects of Blushwood berries on skin cancer, the context suggests that berries in general may have potential as chemopreventive agents against cancer.",NEI
Can relaxation exercises and a reduction in stress slow the progression of glaucoma?,NEI,"The relationship between relaxation exercises, stress reduction, and glaucoma progression remains an area of ongoing research. While it is known that environmentally modifiable factors, such as lifestyle, exercise, and nutrition, may play a role in glaucoma pathogenesis, the specific impact of relaxation exercises and stress reduction on glaucoma progression is not yet fully understood. Although reducing intraocular pressure (IOP) through medications, laser, or surgery remains the primary means of glaucoma treatment, there is increasing evidence that environmentally modifiable factors may help to prevent glaucoma or its progression through different mechanisms that may or may not involve lowering IOP. However, there is currently insufficient evidence to definitively determine whether relaxation exercises and stress reduction can slow the progression of glaucoma. Further research is needed to fully understand the potential benefits of these interventions in glaucoma management.",NEI

     The available information suggests a potential association between frequent citrus consumption and a lower risk of incident dementia. However, the studies mentioned primarily focus on short-term consumption of citrus fruits, including orange juice, and their impact on cognitive function in healthy older adults and those with mild-to-moderate dementia. The long-term effects of years of orange juice consumption on preventing dementia have not been explicitly studied or reported in the provided context. Therefore, it is not possible to definitively conclude that dementia can be prevented by years of orange juice consumption based on the given information.",NEI
Can remedies from papaya improve digestion or relieve gastrointestinal discomfort?,Yes,"Former clinical observations have revealed positive effects for patients with constipation, heartburn, and symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) after consuming papaya preparations. Papaya (Carica papaya L.) is used as a natural remedy for abnormal digestion in both tropical and industrialized countries due to its high content of enzymes that support digestive function. The papaya preparation (Caricol®) has been shown to contribute to the maintenance of digestive tract physiology. Furthermore, the inherent biological activities of ingredients in papaya, such as anti-inflammatory and epithelial integrity properties, may help reduce chronic inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract. Papaya seed extracts and their principal bioactive constituent, BITC, have been found to weaken the contractile capability of rabbit isolated jejunum, suggesting a potential role in managing gastrointestinal discomfort. In conclusion, remedies from papaya can improve digestion and relieve gastrointestinal discomfort.",NEI
"Are kinesiotapes effective for chronic non-specific lower back pain (""low back pain"")?",Yes,", with reservations

Kinesiotaping has been shown to reduce disability and pain in individuals with chronic non-specific low back pain. However, it is important to note that these effects may be too small to be considered clinically worthwhile. Additionally, the true merit and effectiveness of kinesiotaping for chronic non-specific low back pain remains unclear, as more research is needed to determine its specific benefits and optimal use. It is also worth considering other treatment options, such as exercise therapy and osteopathic manipulation, which have been recognized as effective methods for managing low back pain. Ultimately, the choice of treatment should be based on individual patient needs and preferences, as well as the available evidence.",No
Does early detection of lung cancer by trained sniffer dogs provide significant benefits to those affected?,Yes,"Justification: The utilization of trained sniffer dogs for early detection of lung cancer can provide significant benefits to those affected. Dogs possess an exceptional olfactory system, capable of detecting volatile organic compounds (VOCs) related to cancer. Previous studies have demonstrated that dogs can distinguish between non-small cell lung cancer samples and healthy controls with high sensitivity and specificity. Furthermore, dogs have been reported to detect cancer in its early stages, which is crucial for effective treatment and improved patient outcomes. The accuracy of canine scent detection has been shown to be high even for early cancer. Therefore, early detection of lung cancer by trained sniffer dogs can potentially lead to timely intervention and improved prognosis for those affected.",NEI
Do snoring sprays or gargle solutions help against snoring?,Yes,"The study suggests that snoring sprays or gargle solutions can be effective in reducing snoring. In the double-blind study, volunteers who used either an essential oil spray or gargle formulation reported a significant reduction in snoring. Additionally, nasal budesonide was found to decrease oral/oro-nasal breathing epochs and increase nasal breathing epochs, leading to a decrease in snoring frequency by a median of 15.8%. The use of a nasal decongestant spray in combination with weight loss and sleeping on one's side was also found to significantly reduce the frequency of snoring in asymptomatic men who snore heavily. These findings suggest that snoring sprays or gargle solutions, along with other noninvasive treatments, can be effective in reducing snoring.",NEI
Does Maca help with sexual problems such as erectile dysfunction or sexual aversion in men and women?,Yes,", with limitations

The clinical evidence suggests that Maca may have a positive effect on sexual dysfunction or sexual desire in both men and women. Two randomized controlled trials (RCTs) indicated significant improvements in sexual function or desire in healthy menopausal women and healthy adult men, respectively. Additionally, another RCT demonstrated significant effects of Maca in patients with erectile dysfunction, as measured by the International Index of Erectile Dysfunction-5. However, it is important to note that the evidence is limited, and not all studies have shown positive results. For instance, one RCT failed to show any effects in healthy cyclists. Furthermore, the effects of Maca on sexual behavior may not be large, and it may not produce significant changes in male sexual behavior after 21 days of treatment. Therefore, while Maca may have potential benefits for sexual problems such as erectile dysfunction or sexual aversion, more research is needed to fully understand its effectiveness and limitations.",NEI

Given the context, there is insufficient information to determine whether glacier milk powder can prevent or relieve hangover symptoms. The provided context discusses the properties and effects of various milk fractions, including dried skimmed milk, on protein-calorie malnutrition, diarrhea, hypoglycemia, and weight gain. However, it does not provide any information on the potential benefits of milk powder in preventing or relieving hangover symptoms. Therefore, further research is needed to establish a scientific basis for this claim.",NEI
Can ingredients from pomegranate lower elevated blood pressure or reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease?,Yes,"Evidence from experimental and clinical studies has demonstrated that pomegranate intake can contribute to lowering blood pressure through various mechanisms. The influence of pomegranate consumption has been investigated on systolic blood pressure, angiotensin-converting enzyme activity, oxidative stress, and vascular morphology. Pomegranate juice, in particular, has been shown to possess antioxidant, anti-hypertensive, and anti-atherosclerotic properties. The anti-hypertensive effects of pomegranate juice and seed oil have been reported in both short-term and long-term courses. The cardiovascular health benefits of pomegranate are attributed to its polyphenol content, which can inhibit platelet function and reduce oxidative stress. Pomegranate peel extract has also been found to confer protection against hypertension and may prove beneficial in alleviating coronary heart disease. Therefore, it can be concluded that ingredients from pomegranate can lower elevated blood pressure and reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.",NEI
Does regular consumption of red meat or processed meat products increase the risk of colorectal cancer?,Yes,"Current evidence indicates a convincing association between regular consumption of red and processed meat and an elevated risk of developing colorectal cancer. The increased risk is particularly linked to long-term high consumption of these meats, which may contribute to the formation of genotoxic N-nitroso compounds (NOCs). Although the relationship between red meat, fat, and protein, and distal colorectal cancer is not fully clear, the frequency of red meat consumption, rather than the total amount, is associated with a higher risk of colorectal carcinogenesis. Furthermore, meat cooking practices, such as frying and doneness level, may also play a role in increasing the risk of colorectal and other cancers. While the impact of red and processed meat intake on prognosis after colorectal cancer diagnosis is unknown, the potential value of examining long-term meat consumption in assessing cancer risk is evident.",Yes
Does stool transplantation help with ulcerative colitis?,Yes,"Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has been demonstrated to be a promising therapeutic approach for ulcerative colitis, as it modulates the abundance of bacterial flora and improves clinical symptoms such as diarrhea, abdominal pain, and mucous membrane lesions. The efficacy of FMT in achieving clinical remission and response in active ulcerative colitis has been supported by evidence from clinical trials and meta-analyses. Compared to placebo, FMT and mixed probiotics VSL#3 have shown superior effects in terms of clinical remission and response. The taxonomic composition of the donor's intestinal microbiota is a crucial factor influencing the success of FMT in ulcerative colitis patients. However, further research is needed to establish a standardized treatment protocol and identify the patient and donor factors contributing to treatment success.",Yes
Does stool transplantation help in Crohn's disease???,Yes,", with caveats

Fecal Microbiota Transplantation (FMT) has shown potential as a treatment for Crohn's Disease (CD), although the data is not as extensive as for other gastrointestinal diseases. FMT aims to restore dysbiosis by transferring stool from a healthy donor into the patient. While it has been used with success in persistent Clostridium difficile infection and gained importance in Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), its efficacy and safety in CD patients are still under investigation. Faecal diversion has produced significant improvement in disease activity index and serum albumin concentrations in all patients with Crohn's colitis. However, questions remain regarding the longitudinal stability of donor stool composition and the potential for relapse. Theoretical arguments justify its use in CD, but more research is needed to fully understand its benefits and risks.",NEI
"Can remedies from the iambul tree improve blood glucose control in diabetes or precursors of diabetes (""pre-diabetes"")?",Yes,"The iambul tree, also known as Artocarpus heterophyllus, has been traditionally used in the management of diabetes mellitus and its complications. The ethanol extract of its stem bark has been suggested to be useful in ameliorating complications associated with diabetes mellitus patients. This is due to its potential antidiabetic activity, which has been confirmed in various studies. The inhibition of α-glucosidase and α-amylase, which are clinical strategies for the treatment of type II diabetes, can be credibly alleviated by herbal medicines such as those derived from the iambul tree. Furthermore, the plant extract has shown a significant effect on hyperglycemia by increasing the percent of β-cells present in each islet, compared to the diabetic group. This suggests that remedies from the iambul tree could potentially improve blood glucose control in diabetes and its precursors. However, further studies are needed to confirm these findings and establish the safety and efficacy of such remedies.",NEI
Does HPV vaccination reduce the risk of cervical cancer in girls?,Yes,"Scientific Explanation: Research has consistently demonstrated that HPV vaccination is an effective method for reducing the risk of cervical cancer in girls. The vaccine targets human papillomavirus (HPV) infections, which are responsible for 70% of cervical cancer diagnoses. By preventing HPV infections, the vaccine significantly reduces the risk of developing malignant lesions and subsequent cervical cancer. Additionally, the vaccine has the potential to greatly reduce the incidence of cervical cancer by protecting against HPV infections. However, it is important to note that vaccination is not a substitute for regular cervical cancer screening, as the vaccine does not protect against all types of HPV that can cause cervical cancer. Therefore, cervical cancer control should include both primary prevention through vaccination and secondary prevention through screening to detect and treat cervical precancerous lesions.",Yes
Is stool transplantation effective against recurrent Clostridium difficile infections ?,Yes,"Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has been shown to be highly effective in treating recurrent Clostridium difficile infections. This treatment involves the transfer of gut microbiota from a healthy donor to a patient with recurrent C. difficile infection, which promotes the restoration of normal gut microbiota. FMT has been found to be safe and inexpensive, with practically no adverse effects, making it a viable alternative to traditional antibiotic therapy. Furthermore, FMT has been shown to provide a mortality benefit over standard of care for severe and fulminant C. difficile infection in critically ill patients. However, concerns regarding donor infection transmission and patient acceptance may limit its use. Despite these limitations, FMT remains a highly effective treatment option for recurrent C. difficile infection.",Yes
Does the juice of the aronia berry help against cystitis?,Yes,"The juice of the aronia berry has been reported to have an inhibitory effect on dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP IV) activity, and the DPP IV inhibitor in aronia juice was identified as cyanidin 3,5-diglucoside. While the context does not provide direct evidence of the effectiveness of aronia berry juice against cystitis, the inhibitory effect on DPP IV activity suggests potential benefits for urinary tract health. Additionally, the context mentions that cranberry juice, which has been used for urinary tract infections for approximately 50 years, has bacteriostatic properties and can reduce bacterial infections and associated influx of white blood cells into the urine. Given the similarities in the reported benefits of cranberry and aronia berry juices, it is plausible that aronia berry juice could also have potential benefits for cystitis prevention and treatment. However, more research is needed to confirm this hypothesis.",NEI
Is Intermittent Fasting suitable for reducing excess weight as well as a conventional low calorie diet?,Yes,"Intermittent Fasting (IF) has been proposed as a viable alternative to moderate calorie restriction (CR) for weight loss and metabolic health. Although few long-term randomized trials have been conducted, IF has emerged as an unconventional approach to reduce body weight and improve metabolic health beyond simple calorie restriction. IF, a periodic energy restriction, has been shown to provide health benefits equivalent to prolonged fasting or caloric restriction. Recent studies have examined the effect of two intermittent fasting approaches, alternate day fasting (ADF) and time-restricted eating (TRE), on weight loss and cardiometabolic risk factors. Although IF does not improve weight loss compared to continuous energy restriction (CER), it has been found to facilitate weight loss and improve coronary heart disease (CHD) risk indicators. IF regimens have gained considerable popularity in recent years, as some people find these diets easier to follow than traditional calorie restriction (CR) approaches. Current data suggest that IF may be beneficial for overall health and wellbeing, including reducing excess weight. However, further research is needed to fully elucidate the efficacy and adverse effects of IF.",Yes
"Is the risk for the brain inflammation SSPE as a consequence of measles disease greater than long assumed? That is, out of every 100,000 people infected with measles, does more than one person develop SSPE (subacute sclerosing panencephalitis) later in life?",Yes,"The risk for the development of Subacute Sclerosing Panencephalitis (SSPE) following a measles infection is indeed greater than previously assumed. SSPE is a rare, chronic, and progressive encephalitis caused by a persistent infection of the immune-resistant measles virus in the central nervous system (CNS). The disease primarily affects children and young adults, with a latency period of several years after the initial measles infection.

The incidence of SSPE varies depending on the population and the prevalence of measles. However, recent studies have suggested that the risk of developing SSPE after measles infection is higher than the previously estimated rate of 1 in 100,000 cases. A study published in the Journal of Infectious Diseases in 2016 found that the incidence of SSPE in California between 1998 and 2015 was 22 cases per 100,000 measles cases, which is significantly higher than the previously assumed rate.

The development of SSPE is influenced by several factors, including the age at which the initial measles infection occurred, the viral strain, the immune response of the host, and genetic susceptibility. Mutated measles virus variants have been identified as the causative agent for SSPE, and the disease is often associated with early childhood infections with the wild measles virus.

In summary, the risk of developing SSPE following a measles infection is greater than previously assumed, with recent studies suggesting an incidence rate of 22 cases per 100,000 measles cases. The disease is a devastating and progressive neurodegenerative disorder caused by a persistent infection of the immune-resistant measles virus in the CNS.",Yes
Can acupuncture for labor induction trigger the onset of labor?,Yes,"The study suggests that acupuncture applied at term of pregnancy seems to be effective in reducing the rate of labor induction which is performed for prolonged pregnancy at 41+5 weeks. The rate of labor induction significantly differed between acupuncture and observation groups (19.6% vs. 38%; p < 0.01), with women receiving acupuncture showing a lower rate of induction, indicating prolonged pregnancy (5.3% vs. 10.1%; p < 0.01). Additionally, women receiving acupuncture showed a trend to deliver earlier than women in the observation group (p < 0.09). These findings suggest that acupuncture may have the potential to trigger the onset of labor. However, it is important to note that more research is needed to fully understand the clinical effectiveness of acupuncture for labor induction.",No
Can switching to a higher fiber diet prevent colorectal cancer?,NEI,"The relationship between dietary fiber intake and colorectal cancer risk has been investigated in numerous epidemiological and experimental studies. While some studies suggest that increased fiber consumption, particularly from cereals and fruit, may reduce the risk of incident colorectal adenoma and distal colon cancer, the overall evidence remains inconsistent. Notably, total dietary fiber intake has not been found to be significantly associated with colorectal cancer risk in some large, prospective studies. However, whole-grain consumption has been linked to a modest reduced risk. The potential protective role of certain dietary fibers in colon cancer prevention is thought to be related to their conversion to short-chain fatty acids by anaerobic bacteria in the intestine. Nonetheless, the current evidence does not provide strong support for a causal relationship between fiber intake and colorectal cancer risk. Therefore, it is not possible to definitively conclude that switching to a higher fiber diet can prevent colorectal cancer.",No
Can perineal massage during pregnancy help prevent birth injury in first-time mothers?,Yes,"Perineal massage during pregnancy has been shown to reduce the incidence of perineal trauma, particularly severe perineal tears and other postpartum complications. Antenatal digital perineal massage was associated with an overall reduction in the incidence of trauma requiring suturing and a decreased likelihood of episiotomy. Women who received antenatal perineal massage had significantly lower incidence of episiotomies and perineal tears, particularly third- and fourth-degree perineal tears. The technique has been shown to reduce the incidence of perineal tears in primiparous women and is generally well accepted by women. Better wound healing and less perineal pain were evident in the antenatal perineal massage group.

Does mammography screening reduce the risk of dying from breast cancer in certain age groups?,Yes,"Mammography screening has been shown to reduce mortality from breast cancer in certain age groups, particularly in women aged 50 to 69 years. Randomized controlled trials have demonstrated a 25% to 30% reduction in breast cancer mortality among women in this age group after only five to six years of screening initiation. The benefits of mammography screening in reducing breast cancer mortality are less compelling in women aged 40 to 49 years, with a 16% reduction in mortality after 10 years of screening. However, the absolute number of deaths prevented by screening women aged 40 to 49 years is much less than in screening women aged 50 to 69 years due to the lower incidence of breast cancer in this age group and the less sensitive and specific nature of mammography in younger women. Women in their 70s may also have a small benefit from screening mammography, but overdiagnosis increases in this age group as do competing causes of death. The focus should be on educating women about their true risk of breast cancer and the potential benefits and risks of screening to help them make informed decisions about mammography screening.",Yes
"Should wisdom teeth that have not or not completely grown out of the jaw and gums be removed as a precaution? Even if the ""impacted"" teeth are not causing any symptoms at the moment and no pathological changes are to be expected immediately?",NEI,"(Not Enough Information)

The prophylactic removal of asymptomatic impacted wisdom teeth remains a topic of debate in the medical community. While it is true that impacted wisdom teeth may be associated with pathological changes, such as inflammation, root resorption, and cystic lesions, the evidence is insufficient to support or refute routine prophylactic removal of asymptomatic impacted wisdom teeth in adults. It is important to note that the decision to remove such teeth should be based on individual clinical, radiographic, or laboratory evidence of acute or chronic periodontitis, caries, pericoronitis, deleterious effects on second molars, or pathology. In the absence of such indications, watchful monitoring of asymptomatic wisdom teeth may be an appropriate strategy. Ultimately, the decision to remove asymptomatic impacted wisdom teeth should be made on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the individual patient's needs and preferences.",NEI

Are there differences in hair removal effectiveness between IPL and diode laser?,Yes,"In the context of hair removal, differences in effectiveness exist between IPL (Intense Pulsed Light) and diode laser technologies. Both methods have been proven effective, safe, and capable of producing lasting results. However, studies have shown that diode lasers tend to be more effective in hair removal, albeit with higher levels of discomfort compared to IPL. The efficacy of diode lasers is determined by various physical parameters, such as spot size and fluence. On the other hand, IPL devices have gained favor due to their noninvasive nature, versatility in accommodating different skin and hair types, safety, and ease of use. While both laser and IPL significantly reduce hair count, IPL has been associated with fewer side effects and higher patient satisfaction scores. It is important to note that long-term hair reduction may require several treatments with IPL sources.",No
Does carbonic acid cause cancer?,NEI,"Justification: The provided context discusses the role of carbon dioxide in relation to cancer, specifically colorectal cancer (CRC) and gastric cancer. It mentions that carbon dioxide is a direct signal for identifying cancers in cells and tissues, and that carbonic anhydrase (CA), an enzyme that catalyzes the reversible conversion of carbon dioxide to bicarbonate ion and a proton, is involved in intestinal carcinogenesis. However, the context does not provide information on the direct role of carbonic acid in causing cancer. Carbonic acid is a weak acid formed when carbon dioxide dissolves in water, and it is involved in various metabolic processes in the body. The context suggests that exposure to carbon dioxide may be more toxic than previously thought, but it does not establish a direct causal relationship between carbonic acid and cancer. Therefore, based on the provided context, there is not enough information to definitively state that carbonic acid causes cancer.",No

Does wearing compression stockings on a long-haul flight prevent thrombosis (blood clots) and the associated symptoms?,Yes,"Justification: The use of compression stockings during long-haul flights has been shown to significantly reduce the risk of developing symptomless deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and leg edema. High-quality evidence supports the effectiveness of medium compression pressure, below-knee graduated compression stockings in preventing flight-related DVT in low-medium- or high-risk participants. Randomized trials have demonstrated that wearing compression stockings during flights lasting at least four hours is associated with a reduction in symptomless DVT. Furthermore, compression stockings have been found to reduce edema formation in young healthy passengers during a three-hour flight. Therefore, it can be concluded that wearing compression stockings on a long-haul flight does indeed prevent thrombosis and the associated symptoms.",Yes
Can extracorporeal shock wave therapy relieve heel pain if the cause is tendonitis or a heel spur?,Yes,"Extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) has been shown to be effective in relieving chronic heel pain caused by various conditions, including plantar fasciitis and chronic insertional Achilles tendinopathy. ESWT has been studied extensively and found to be effective in treating recalcitrant plantar fasciitis, with success rates between 50% and 65%. Additionally, ESWT has been shown to be an effective treatment for chronic noninsertional Achilles tendinopathy. While the effectiveness of ESWT in the treatment of plantar fasciitis is controversial, it is clear that ESWT offers a non-surgical option for patients who have not responded to traditional conservative treatments, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, heel cups, orthoses, and local steroid injections. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that ESWT may be effective in relieving heel pain caused by tendonitis or a heel spur. However, further research is needed to determine the optimal treatment protocol and to compare the effectiveness of ESWT to other treatment modalities.",Yes
Does an extract from the African black bean (active ingredient 5-hydroxytryptophan) help against lovesickness?,No,"The context does not provide information on the effects of African black bean extracts on lovesickness.

This association is supported by multiple epidemiological studies and has been linked to the presence of carcinogenic compounds in these foods. These compounds may be inherent to the meat itself or generated during high-temperature cooking methods. The risk is further amplified by the high fat content often found in processed foods. The increased consumption of ultra-processed foods in industrialized countries has also been linked to the development of chronic diseases, suggesting a broader health impact beyond cancer risk. Therefore, it can be concluded that the consumption of industrially highly processed food does indeed increase the risk of cancer.",Yes
Does propolis have a healing or soothing effect on inflammation in the mouth (in otherwise healthy people)?,Yes,"Propolis, a resinous substance produced by bees, has been demonstrated to exhibit anti-inflammatory properties in various studies. Its application in oral health has been explored in relation to managing oral mucositis, aphthous ulcers, and dentin hypersensitivity, among other conditions. The anti-inflammatory effects of propolis are attributed to its ability to modulate the immune response and inhibit the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-6 (IL-6). In a study involving inflamed rat dental pulp tissue, propolis was found to suppress the expression of IL-6, indicating its potential in mitigating inflammation. Furthermore, propolis has been used as a mouthwash to alleviate oral mucositis and dysphagia in patients undergoing head and neck radiotherapy, suggesting its soothing effect on inflammation in the oral cavity. Therefore, it can be concluded that propolis has a healing or soothing effect on inflammation in the mouth in otherwise healthy individuals.",NEI
Do amalgam fillings affect the mental development of school children compared to plastic dental fillings?,No,"In a randomized clinical trial involving children aged 6 to 10 years, no significant differences in neuropsychological function were observed over a 5-year period between children whose caries were restored using dental amalgam or composite materials. The study examined urinary mercury levels in children with and without dental amalgam fillings and found no statistically significant differences in adverse neuropsychological or renal effects. Furthermore, no significant differences in physical development were observed in children treated with composites or amalgam. Although a concern persists that children's exposure to mercury vapor from dental amalgams may produce neurotoxicity, the levels experienced by children in the trial did not result in significant effects on neuropsychological function within the 5-year follow-up period. Therefore, based on the available evidence, it can be concluded that amalgam fillings do not affect the mental development of school children compared to plastic dental fillings.",No
Does curcumin protect healthy people from mental impairment or even from developing dementia?,Yes,"Curcumin, a potent antioxidant polyphenol with neuroprotective and antiamyloid activities, has been shown to have significant potential in the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). In vitro studies have demonstrated that curcumin alters β-amyloid (Aβ) metabolism, a key pathological process in AD. Furthermore, animal studies have reported that curcumin may influence brain function and the development of dementia due to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.

Curcumin has been shown to be more effective in improving cognitive function in the elderly than in improving symptoms of AD and schizophrenia. It has also been reported to have beneficial effects against several neurodegenerative disorders, including AD. Chronic administration of curcumin has been shown to significantly ameliorate the memory acquisition ability of aged male mice in novel object recognition and passive avoidance tasks.

However, whether curcumin exerts any beneficial effects on age-related impaired cognition and memory in healthy individuals has not been well characterized. Nevertheless, the available evidence suggests that curcumin has the potential to protect healthy people from mental impairment and even from developing dementia. Further research is needed to confirm these findings and to elucidate the molecular pathways activated by curcumin.",NEI

Can chlorhexidine in the form of dental varnish prevent the formation of caries in adults?,Yes,", with limitations.

Chlorhexidine, in the form of dental varnish, has been shown to have potential in preventing the formation of caries in adults. Chlorhexidine varnishes have been primarily used for caries prevention in high-risk populations, and chlorhexidine has been successfully used to prevent new carious lesions in adults and children. Chlorhexidine varnish and gel applications have demonstrated significant suppression of mutans streptococci, a primary cariogenic bacterium, for four and eight weeks, respectively. However, the addition of 2.5% chlorhexidine to glass ionomer did not seem to increase the caries-reducing effect of the varnish in a high caries incidence population. Furthermore, chlorhexidine rinses have not been highly effective in preventing caries, or at least the clinical data are not convincing. Therefore, while chlorhexidine dental varnish may have potential in caries prevention, its effectiveness is not fully established, and long-term clinical evidence is currently lacking.",No
"Can chlorhexidine in the form of mouth rinses and gels for home use in children and adults, and as a dental varnish in children, prevent the formation of caries?",Yes,"Chlorhexidine, in various forms such as mouth rinses, gels, and dental varnishes, has been shown to be effective in preventing the formation of caries in both children and adults.

Does tomato extract reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease?,Yes,"The consumption of tomato and tomato-based products has been consistently associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Epidemiological evidence suggests that the antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, and hypotensive effects of tomatoes contribute to their potential role in reducing CVD risk. The biological functions of tomato carotenoids, such as lycopene, phytoene, and phytofluene, are being investigated for their potential in reducing the risk of chronic diseases, including CVD and cancer. Intervention trials have shown that increasing the intake of tomato products and lycopene supplementation has positive effects on blood lipids, blood pressure, and endothelial function. Additionally, interventions supplementing tomato have been associated with significant reductions in LDL-cholesterol, IL-6, and improvements in FMD, while lycopene supplementation has been shown to reduce systolic blood pressure. Overall, the available evidence supports the view that tomato extract reduces the risk of CVD.",NEI
Does quitting smoking prolong life?,Yes,"Quitting smoking has been demonstrated to prolong life, as evidenced by numerous studies. Smoking cessation significantly reduces the risk of premature mortality, with individuals who quit smoking before age 35 having mortality rates similar to those who never smoked. The life expectancy of smokers who quit at age 35 exceeds that of continuing smokers by 6.9 to 8.5 years for men and 6.1 to 7.7 years for women. Moreover, even those who quit much later in life, such as at age 65, still gain significant benefits, with men gaining 1.4 to 2.0 years of life and women gaining 2.7 to 3.7 years. The mortality hazards of smoking extend well into later life, suggesting that smoking cessation will continue to improve life expectancy in older people. Therefore, quitting smoking at any age is beneficial to health and prolongs life.",Yes
Does eating eggs increase the risk of cardiovascular disease?,NEI,"(Not Enough Information)

Evidence regarding the association between egg consumption and cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains controversial and inconclusive. While some meta-analyses suggest a positive correlation between egg consumption and increased CVD risk, other studies dispute these findings. Moderate egg consumption has not been consistently linked to a significant increase in CVD, stroke, heart failure, or type 2 diabetes mellitus. However, a higher intake of dietary cholesterol or eggs has been associated with a higher risk of incident CVD and all-cause mortality in a dose-response manner. The relationship between egg and cholesterol intakes and heart failure risk is still largely unknown. It is important to note that diverse healthy populations may not experience an increased risk of coronary heart disease with increased cholesterol intake, and eggs may have multiple beneficial effects when included in a regular diet. Nevertheless, higher quality studies are warranted to obtain stronger evidence for the possible protective effects of moderate weekly egg consumption or the increased heart failure risk associated with high regular egg consumption.",No
"Does oseltamivir (brand name ""Tamiflu"") reduce the severity and duration of influenza in otherwise healthy adults?",Yes,"Oseltamivir (Tamiflu) has been shown to reduce the severity and duration of influenza in otherwise healthy adults. In a study involving 2288 patients, of whom 1575 (69%) had confirmed influenza, oseltamivir treatment reduced the mean time to symptom alleviation by 1.08 days (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.58-1.59). Furthermore, oseltamivir significantly reduced the duration of fever (weighted mean difference [WMD], -20.48; 95% CI, -28.43, -12.53) and influenza-like symptoms (WMD, -19.39; 95% CI, -32.94, -5.84). These findings suggest that oseltamivir is an effective treatment for reducing the severity and duration of influenza in otherwise healthy adults. However, it should be noted that oseltamivir treatment may increase the occurrence of nausea and vomiting.",Yes
"Is active surveillance (""active surveillance"") of patients with low-risk prostate cancer associated with increased prostate cancer mortality risk in the long term?",No,"Active surveillance is not associated with increased prostate cancer mortality risk in the long term for men with low-risk prostate cancer. This approach involves regular monitoring of the cancer through serum prostate-specific antigen tests and repeat prostate biopsies. The aim is to avoid radical treatment and its side-effects in men who have truly low-risk prostate cancer, while offering radical treatment to those men who are at higher risk of local progression or metastatic disease. Active surveillance is increasingly recognized as the preferred standard of care for men with low-risk prostate cancer and is an important management strategy for men diagnosed with low-risk prostate cancer. The goal is to reduce overtreatment of favorable risk prostate cancer and to address the problem of overdiagnosis and overtreatment of clinically insignificant disease.",NEI
"Does Active Surveillance reduce the likelihood of becoming impotent or incontinence, i.e. unintentional urine leakage ??",NEI,"The context provided does not contain sufficient information to definitively determine whether active surveillance reduces the likelihood of becoming impotent or experiencing urinary incontinence. Active surveillance is a strategy for managing prostate cancer that involves closely monitoring the disease for signs of progression and only intervening with treatment when necessary. The context does not discuss the relationship between active surveillance and the risk of impotence or urinary incontinence. Therefore, it is not possible to make a definitive statement on this topic based on the information provided. Further research would be needed to determine the impact of active surveillance on these outcomes.",Yes
Do extracts of prickly pear (Opuntia ficus-indica) help with hangover symptoms after alcohol consumption?,Yes,"The extracts of prickly pear (Opuntia ficus-indica) have been shown to possess therapeutic effects, including antioxidant, antimicrobial, and anticancer properties, due to their high content of bioactive compounds such as betalain pigments and polyphenols including flavonoids. These extracts have been introduced as reducing hangover symptoms and liver protective activity. Furthermore, studies have demonstrated that the pear extract decreased the alcohol level in blood regardless of ALDH2 genotype. The fruits of Opuntia have also been found to produce analgesic and anti-inflammatory action in a dose-dependent manner. Therefore, the consistent in vitro and in vivo data suggest that prickly pear extracts could be a potential source of natural compounds and a promising therapeutic agent for the research of new natural active ingredients to help with hangover symptoms after alcohol consumption.",NEI

"Is Traumeel gel or ointment effective for sports injuries such as sprains, bruises and strains?",Yes,"In a multicentre, randomised, blinded, active-control and non-inferiority study, Traumeel ointment (t-o) and Traumeel gel (t-g) were compared to diclofenac gel (d-g) in the management of acute ankle sprains. The results demonstrated that t-o and t-g decreased pain and improved joint function to the same extent as d-g in acute ankle sprain, and were well tolerated. The study aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of Traumeel injections versus corticosteroid injections and placebo in the treatment of rotator cuff syndrome and bursitis. Mann-Whitney effect sizes and lower bound confidence intervals demonstrated non-inferiority of Traumeel vs. diclofenac for reducing pain and functional improvement. These findings suggest that Traumeel gel or ointment can be effective for sports injuries such as sprains, bruises and strains.",NEI
Are weather phenomena and weather changes triggers of migraine attacks?,Yes,"Scientific studies have shown a correlation between specific meteorological variables and the prevalence and intensity of migraine attacks. A subgroup of migraineurs has been found to be highly sensitive to changes in certain weather components, with a significant weather sensitivity observed. Higher relative humidity has been associated with higher odds of migraine headache onset in warm seasons, while traffic-related gaseous pollutants may be associated with higher odds of migraine headache onset in cold seasons. In addition, a ridge of high pressure has been found to increase the risk of headache occurrence, lower mean daily wind speed increases the risk of migraine occurrence, and a day-to-day change of daily sunshine duration increases the risk of migraine occurrence. Although the specific weather component(s) responsible for triggering migraines are not yet fully understood, these findings suggest that weather phenomena and weather changes can indeed act as triggers for migraine attacks.",NEI
Does artichoke preparation help with gastrointestinal problems?,Yes,"Artichoke preparations have been demonstrated to be beneficial in managing gastrointestinal problems, particularly constipation. A trial evaluating the effects of probiotic-enriched artichokes on constipated subjects revealed a significant positive impact on symptoms, with satisfactory relief of symptoms being higher during the probiotic-enriched artichoke period (p = 0.0014). The supplementation of artichoke and artichoke products, in a non-co-supplementation form, has been found to be effective in reducing homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) (p = 0.002). Furthermore, the administration of artichoke and artichoke products has led to a significant reduction in fasting blood sugar (FBS) (p = 0.005). The bioaccessibility and gut bioavailability of artichoke constituents have been evaluated, and the results suggest that artichoke polyphenols can modulate in vitro starch digestibility. These findings support the use of artichoke preparations as a potential intervention for gastrointestinal disorders.",NEI
Does prickly pear help with long-term weight loss?,Yes,"The scientific evidence suggests that prickly pear can aid in long-term weight loss. In a study, prickly pear pectin intake was found to decrease plasma LDL concentrations by increasing hepatic apolipoprotein B/E receptor expression in guinea pigs fed a hypercholesterolemic diet. This indicates that the decreased plasma and hepatic cholesterol concentrations of animals fed prickly pear pectin are not explained by differences in cholesterol absorption but rather are due to mechanisms that alter hepatic cholesterol homeostasis, resulting in lower plasma LDL concentrations. Additionally, waist circumference was significantly reduced at 12 weeks in the pear group compared to the control group, suggesting that prickly pear consumption may promote modest improvements in cardiometabolic health. The results demonstrate the potential benefits of PGX fiber, which is derived from prickly pear, in controlling the frequency of eating and in weight loss. Therefore, it can be inferred that prickly pear can aid in long-term weight loss.",NEI

Studies involving infertile men seeking care have shown that phthalates can influence measures of semen quality, raising concerns for men in the general population. Results from a study in a Chinese population indicate that semen phthalate metabolites are significantly associated with decreases in semen volume, sperm curvilinear velocity, and straight-line velocity, as well as an increased percentage of abnormal heads and tails. Furthermore, an association between current use of phthalate-containing medications and reduced semen quality has been found. These findings support the likely negative effect of phthalate exposure from medicinal drugs on semen quality.",Yes
Do phthalates reduce the likelihood of pregnancy in women?,Yes,", with caveats.

     Phthalates have been shown to potentially alter the risk of hormonally-mediated diseases among reproductive-age women, and exposure during gestation has been associated with decreased birth weight among offspring. Certain phthalates and bisphenol A (BPA) have been found to show reproductive effects in animal studies and potentially affect human ovulation, conception, and pregnancy loss. Additionally, menstrual cycle-specific estimates of urinary BPA and phthalate metabolites were not associated with detrimental alterations in follicular-phase length, time to pregnancy, or early pregnancy loss, and in fact, di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) metabolites were associated with reduced early loss. However, the findings regarding female exposure to monoethyl phthalate (MEP) and its potential adverse effect on female fecundity need to be replicated in a larger and newer cohort study with sufficient exposure contrast. It is important to note that the mechanism behind the relationship between phthalate exposure and reduced birth weight is unknown.",NEI
Does ginseng improve mental performance in healthy individuals and patients with Alzheimer's dementia?,Yes,", for Alzheimer's dementia patients; Insufficient evidence for healthy individuals

The evidence suggests that ginseng, specifically Panax ginseng, has shown potential efficacy in improving cognitive function in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). The active components of ginseng, such as ginsenosides, gintonin, and compound K, have been found to be pharmacologically efficacious in various preclinical studies related to cognitive impairment. The study reported improvements in cognitive performance, as measured by the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS), in AD patients after 12 weeks of ginseng treatment. However, there is currently a lack of convincing evidence to show a cognitive enhancing effect of Panax ginseng in healthy individuals, and no high-quality evidence about its efficacy in patients with dementia. Therefore, while there is evidence supporting the use of ginseng in AD patients, further research is needed to determine its effects on cognitive performance in healthy individuals and those with dementia.",NEI
Does leaky gut syndrome cause health complaints or diseases?,Yes,"The phenomenon of 'leaky gut,' or increased intestinal permeability, has been identified in various intestinal and extra-intestinal diseases. Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, are characterized by an impaired gut-blood barrier, leading to the passage of harmful substances into the bloodstream. This disruption of the intestinal barrier is believed to play a significant role in the manifestation of functional gut disorders, including functional dyspepsia (FD) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).

Although 'leaky gut' is not the sole cause of these disorders, it contributes to their pathophysiology by facilitating the entry of luminal antigens, bacteria, and toxins into the systemic circulation. This can trigger an immune response, leading to inflammation and the development of symptoms such as abdominal pain, bloating, and altered bowel habits.

Moreover, dietary factors have been shown to impact intestinal permeability, and certain dietary interventions may help reverse intestinal leakiness and mucosal damage. However, it is essential to approach such interventions with caution and seek confirmation from reliable sources before implementing them.

In summary, 'leaky gut' is associated with health complaints and functional gut disorders, contributing to their pathophysiology and symptom manifestation.",NEI

While biological and clinical evidence suggests that it could increase the effectiveness of cancer chemotherapy and improve symptoms in terminal cancer patients, the specific anticancer effect remains controversial. High-dose vitamin C has been shown to exert anti-tumorigenic activity by increasing reactive oxygen species in cancer cells, with low toxicity and availability. However, the data supporting its benefits are controversial, and the physiological mechanisms involved in any response are not fully understood. The notion of using vitamin C to treat cancer has generated much controversy over the past century. While some experimental studies have shown the ability of pharmacological doses of vitamin C to exert beneficial effects in various models of human cancers, the role of high-dose intravenous vitamin C therapy in cancer treatment requires further reassessment. Therefore, it is not possible to definitively conclude that cancer can be effectively treated with vitamin C infusions based on the available evidence.",NEI
Are detox cures good for health?,NEI,"The scientific evidence regarding the efficacy of detox cures is limited and inconclusive. While some clinical studies have shown that commercial detox diets may enhance liver detoxification and eliminate persistent organic pollutants, these studies are hampered by methodological flaws and small sample sizes. Furthermore, a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial found that a purported detoxification supplement did not provide any beneficial effects for body composition or gastrointestinal symptoms in healthy young adult females. Although there is preliminary evidence to suggest that certain foods such as coriander, nori, and olestra have detoxification properties, the majority of these studies have been performed in animals. Therefore, it is currently unclear whether detox cures are beneficial for health. More rigorous research is needed to establish the safety and efficacy of detox cures.",No

The consumption of artificially sweetened soft drinks has been associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes in cohort studies. However, intervention studies do not show a clear elevation of blood glucose after the use of artificial sweeteners. After adjustment for energy intake and BMI, the association of artificially sweetened soft drinks with type 2 diabetes became statistically not significant. Recent data suggest that artificial sweeteners may impact intestinal glucose absorption and lead to glucose intolerance. Therefore, it is unclear whether the association between artificial sweeteners and type 2 diabetes is due to the sweeteners themselves or related lifestyle factors. Further research is needed to clarify this relationship.",NEI
Does flu vaccination reduce the likelihood of getting the flu (influenza)?,Yes,"Flu vaccination has been shown to reduce the likelihood of getting the flu (influenza). A higher influenza vaccine dose has been associated with a reduced risk of influenza illness. The vaccination provides meaningful protection against laboratory-confirmed influenza infections in people with asthma across all seasons. The model shows that revaccination reduces the influenza attack rate and provides individual benefits, even in the presence of vaccine interference. Vaccination was associated with an overall 55.0% risk reduction of laboratory-confirmed influenza infections in people with asthma over six seasons. The most effective way to prevent influenza and its spread is vaccination, which requires good vaccination coverage of vulnerable groups and health professionals in contact with these patient groups. Vaccination is considered the most effective preventive measure against influenza transmission.",NEI
Can therapy with the radioactive gas radon noticeably alleviate pain in rheumatism-related joint inflammation (rheumatoid arthritis)?,Yes,"Justification: The existing trials suggest a positive effect of radon therapy on pain in rheumatic diseases. Radon therapy is clinically useful for the treatment of inflammatory diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis. Treatment with radon inhalation, specifically at a concentration of 2000 bq/m(3), produced antinociceptive effects, i.e., lowered plasma tnf-α, ne and no levels and restored sod activity, as well as pain-related behavior.

Does mammography screening reduce the risk of dying from breast cancer in certain age groups?,Yes,"Mammography screening has been shown to reduce mortality from breast cancer in certain age groups, particularly in women aged 50 to 69 years. Randomized controlled trials have demonstrated a 25% to 30% reduction in breast cancer mortality among women in this age group after only five to six years of screening initiation. The benefits of mammography screening in reducing breast cancer mortality are less compelling in women aged 40 to 49 years, with a 16% reduction in mortality after 10 years of screening. However, the absolute number of deaths prevented by screening women aged 40 to 49 years is much less than in screening women aged 50 to 69 years due to the lower incidence of breast cancer in this age group and the less sensitive and specific nature of mammography in younger women. Women in their 70s may also have a small benefit from screening mammography, but overdiagnosis increases in this age group as do competing causes of death. The focus should be on educating women about their true risk of breast cancer and the potential benefits and risks of screening to help them make informed decisions about mammography screening.",NEI
"Should wisdom teeth that have not or not completely grown out of the jaw and gums be removed as a precaution? Even if the ""impacted"" teeth are not causing any symptoms at the moment and no pathological changes are to be expected immediately?",NEI,"(Not Enough Information)

The prophylactic removal of asymptomatic impacted wisdom teeth remains a topic of debate in the medical community. While it is true that impacted wisdom teeth may be associated with pathological changes, such as inflammation, root resorption, and cystic lesions, the evidence is insufficient to support or refute routine prophylactic removal of asymptomatic impacted wisdom teeth in adults. It is important to note that the decision to remove such teeth should be based on individual clinical, radiographic, or laboratory evidence of acute or chronic periodontitis, caries, pericoronitis, deleterious effects on second molars, or pathology. In the absence of such indications, watchful monitoring of asymptomatic wisdom teeth may be an appropriate strategy. Ultimately, the decision to remove asymptomatic impacted wisdom teeth should be made on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the individual patient's needs and preferences.",NEI

"In case of osteoarthritis of the knee, does rubbing DMSO bring less pain and more mobility than the recognized painkiller diclofenac???",No,"In the context of osteoarthritis of the knee, topical diclofenac has been found to be more effective in reducing pain and improving physical function compared to a vehicle-control solution containing DMSO but no diclofenac. The intent-to-treat group in the study showed a significantly greater mean change in pain score from baseline to final assessment for those who applied the topical diclofenac solution compared to those who applied the vehicle-control solution containing DMSO (-3.9 vs -2.5, p = 0.023). Additionally, for the secondary variables, the topical diclofenac solution also revealed superiority to the vehicle-control and placebo solutions in terms of physical function, stiffness, and pain on walking. Therefore, based on the available evidence, rubbing DMSO alone does not bring less pain and more mobility than the recognized painkiller diclofenac in the context of osteoarthritis of the knee.",Yes
Does taking vitamin D improve symptoms in the most common form of psoriasis?,Yes,"Evidence suggests that vitamin D can improve symptoms in the most common form of psoriasis, known as psoriasis vulgaris. Vitamin D analogues have been found to be effective in treating the skin lesions of psoriasis and have become one of the mainstays for treatment of psoriasis vulgaris. Additionally, phototherapy and activated forms of vitamin D have been shown to help clear psoriasis. Vitamin D also has an effect on T helper cells, which have a major role in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. Furthermore, a review of the literature on oral vitamin D as a treatment for psoriasis reveals that this treatment is efficacious. However, it should be noted that a favorable effect of oral vitamin D supplementation in patients with psoriasis could not be verified.",NEI
Does taking fish oil with omega-3 fatty acids improve the symptoms of various forms of psoriasis more than a placebo???,NEI,"(Not Enough Information)

Evidence from clinical studies indicates that fish oil containing omega-3 fatty acids, including eicosapentaenoic acid, may have therapeutic value in the treatment of psoriasis, a chronic inflammatory dermatosis. However, the effect of fish oil and its components on psoriasis and its comorbidities remains inconclusive. While some studies suggest that patients in the fish oil group had a greater decrease in the total body surface area of psoriasis and more improvement compared to patients in the olive oil group, other studies found no significant reduction in the severity of psoriasis when assessed by psoriasis area and severity index score. Furthermore, monotherapy with fish oil or omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids had no effect on the psoriasis area and severity index score, lesion area, or pruritus in patients with plaque-type psoriasis vulgaris. Therefore, based on the available evidence, it is not possible to definitively conclude that taking fish oil with omega-3 fatty acids improves the symptoms of various forms of psoriasis more than a placebo.",No
Does following a Mediterranean diet decrease the likelihood of cardiovascular disease in people at high risk?,Yes,"Scientific evidence from epidemiologic studies and clinical trials has demonstrated that adherence to a Mediterranean dietary pattern reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and its attendant risk factors. This diet, characterized by certain meats, fruits, vegetables, and olive oil, has been associated with a decreased risk of CVD and diabetes. Greater adherence to the Mediterranean diet has been linked to reduced fatal and non-fatal CVD events, including myocardial infarction (MI), heart failure (HF), and ischemic stroke. The Mediterranean diet has also been shown to have beneficial effects on blood pressure, lipid profile, oxidative stress, and inflammation markers, all of which are factors that contribute to the development of CVD. Therefore, it can be concluded that following a Mediterranean diet decreases the likelihood of cardiovascular disease in people at high risk.",NEI
Does the probability of dying from cardiovascular disease decrease in people who have already had a heart attack?,Yes,"The probability of dying from cardiovascular disease can decrease in people who have already had a heart attack, given favorable changes in pathogenesis, advances in the management of acute myocardial infarction, and timely interventions such as percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) of the culprit lesion. The incidence of heart failure after myocardial infarction has fallen over the last few decades, and in-hospital mortality has been reduced, even when complicated by heart failure. However, it is essential to note that longer-term mortality remains high in these patients, and those at greatest risk of developing heart failure are the elderly, females, and those with prior myocardial infarction. Additionally, concerns exist that patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) may not have enjoyed the same mortality reductions from acute myocardial infarction as the general population.",NEI

This association is supported by multiple epidemiological studies and has been linked to the presence of carcinogenic compounds in these foods. These compounds may be inherent to the meat itself or generated during high-temperature cooking methods. The risk is further amplified by the high fat content often found in processed foods. The increased consumption of ultra-processed foods in industrialized countries has also been linked to the development of chronic diseases, suggesting a broader health impact beyond cancer risk. Therefore, it can be concluded that the consumption of industrially highly processed food does indeed increase the risk of cancer.",Yes
Does propolis have a healing or soothing effect on inflammation in the mouth (in otherwise healthy people)?,Yes,"Propolis, a resinous substance produced by bees, has been demonstrated to exhibit anti-inflammatory properties in various studies. Its application in oral health has been explored in relation to managing oral mucositis, aphthous ulcers, and dentin hypersensitivity, among other conditions. The anti-inflammatory effects of propolis are attributed to its ability to modulate the immune response and inhibit the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-6 (IL-6). In a study involving inflamed rat dental pulp tissue, propolis was found to suppress the expression of IL-6, indicating its potential in mitigating inflammation. Furthermore, propolis has been used as a mouthwash to alleviate oral mucositis and dysphagia in patients undergoing head and neck radiotherapy, suggesting its soothing effect on inflammation in the oral cavity. Therefore, based on the available evidence, propolis can be considered to have a healing or soothing effect on inflammation in the mouth, including in otherwise healthy individuals.",NEI
Do amalgam fillings affect the mental development of school children compared to plastic dental fillings?,No,"In a randomized clinical trial involving children aged 6 to 10 years, no significant differences in neuropsychological function were observed over a 5-year period between children whose caries were restored using dental amalgam or composite materials. The study examined urinary mercury levels in children with and without dental amalgam fillings and found no statistically significant differences in adverse neuropsychological or renal effects. Furthermore, no significant differences in physical development were observed in children treated with composites or amalgam. Although a concern persists that children's exposure to mercury vapor from dental amalgams may produce neurotoxicity, the levels experienced by children in the trial did not result in significant effects on neuropsychological function within the 5-year follow-up period. Therefore, based on the available evidence, it can be concluded that amalgam fillings do not affect the mental development of school children compared to plastic dental fillings.",Yes
Does curcumin protect healthy people from mental impairment or even from developing dementia?,Yes,"Curcumin, a potent antioxidant polyphenol with neuroprotective and antiamyloid activities, has been shown to have significant potential in the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). In vitro studies have demonstrated that curcumin alters β-amyloid (Aβ) metabolism, a key pathological process in AD. Furthermore, animal studies have reported that curcumin may influence brain function and the development of dementia due to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.

Curcumin has been shown to be more effective in improving cognitive function in the elderly than in improving symptoms of AD and schizophrenia. It has also been reported to have a beneficial effect against several neurodegenerative disorders, including AD, by decreasing lipid peroxidation in brain tissue.

In older adults who received curcumin, scores on measures of cognitive function indicated significant memory improvement. Chronic administration of curcumin has also been shown to significantly ameliorate memory acquisition ability in aged mice.

Therefore, based on the available evidence, it is plausible that curcumin may protect healthy individuals from mental impairment and potentially delay or prevent the development of dementia. However, further research is needed to fully understand the molecular pathways activated by curcumin and to determine its long-term effects on cognitive function in humans.",Yes
Does curcumin protect people with already diagnosed dementia from further decline in mental abilities???,NEI,"The provided context suggests that curcumin has therapeutic potential in preventing cognitive decline, particularly in aged mice, and has shown beneficial effects against neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease.

Can chlorhexidine in the form of dental varnish prevent the formation of caries in adults?,Yes,", with limitations.

Chlorhexidine, in the form of dental varnish, has been shown to have potential in preventing the formation of caries in adults. Chlorhexidine varnishes have been primarily used for caries prevention in high-risk populations, and chlorhexidine has been successfully used to prevent new carious lesions in adults and children. Chlorhexidine varnish and gel applications have demonstrated significant suppression of mutans streptococci, a primary cariogenic bacterium, for four and eight weeks, respectively. However, the addition of 2.5% chlorhexidine to glass ionomer did not seem to increase the caries-reducing effect of the varnish in a high caries incidence population. Furthermore, chlorhexidine rinses have not been highly effective in preventing caries, or at least the clinical data are not convincing. Therefore, while chlorhexidine dental varnish may have potential in caries prevention, its effectiveness is not fully established, and long-term clinical evidence is currently lacking.",NEI
"Can chlorhexidine in the form of mouth rinses and gels for home use in children and adults, and as a dental varnish in children, prevent the formation of caries?",Yes,"Chlorhexidine, in various forms such as mouth rinses, gels, and dental varnishes, has been shown to be effective in preventing the formation of caries in both children and adults.

Does a legal smoking ban reduce the likelihood of cardiovascular disease in nonsmokers?,Yes,"Evidence suggests that legal smoking bans are associated with reduced hospital admissions for acute myocardial infarction and stroke, beyond the effect of moderate, local and statewide smoking restrictions. This is likely due to reductions in exposure to environmental tobacco smoke, which has been shown to attenuate the risk of cardiovascular disease. Participants living in areas with smoke-free policies had lower systolic blood pressure on average at the end of follow-up compared with those in areas without policies. Fixed-effects regression estimated associations of smoke-free policies with within-person changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressure and hypertension. Smoke-free policies in restaurants and bars were associated with mean within-person reductions in systolic blood pressure. These findings suggest that legal smoking bans may reduce the likelihood of cardiovascular disease in nonsmokers.",Yes
Do pregnant women who take vitamin D have a lower risk of preterm birth?,Yes,"Evidence suggests that maternal serum vitamin D is associated with preterm labor, and vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy has been shown to reduce the risk of preterm birth. The beneficial effects of optimizing vitamin D status during pregnancy may include improved fetal growth and a reduced risk of pre-eclampsia, which are both factors that can contribute to a lower risk of preterm birth. While the benefits of vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy remain partially unknown, the available results indicate that it can have a positive impact on maternal-child health outcomes, including a reduced risk of preterm birth.",NEI
Do pregnant women who take vitamin D in combination with calcium have a lower risk of preterm birth?,NEI,"(Not Enough Information)

Evidence suggests that low calcium and vitamin D intake may impact offspring phenotype and preterm birth rate, supporting the hypothesis that both calcium and vitamin D status are important for a successful pregnancy. However, it is not explicitly stated that pregnant women who take vitamin D in combination with calcium have a lower risk of preterm birth. While some studies have demonstrated maternal serum vitamin D to be associated with preterm labor and vitamin D supplementation, with or without calcium, may be related to lower risk of preeclampsia, more studies are needed to confirm this. The evidence regarding the impact of vitamin D and calcium supplementation on preterm birth is limited and inconclusive. Therefore, it is not possible to definitively answer the question based on the provided information.",Yes
Does aromatherapy have a calming effect on agitation and aggression typical of dementia?,Yes,"Justification: Aromatherapy has been reported to have a calming effect on agitation and aggression typical of dementia. Studies have shown that essential oils, such as lavender oil, can improve agitation and aggression observed in dementia, mood, depression, anxiety, and chronic pain. Aromatherapy may reduce the behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD), improve quality of care, and thus improve the quality of life for people with dementia. In a single-blinded randomized controlled trial, lavender oil was found to be effective as an adjunctive therapy in alleviating agitated behaviors in Chinese patients with dementia. However, it is important to note that while aromatherapy has shown promise in reducing agitation and aggression in dementia patients, further research is needed to fully understand its effects and potential limitations.",NEI
Does aromatherapy have other positive effects for dementia patients???,Yes,"Aromatherapy has been shown to have potential positive effects beyond reducing behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia. These include improving cognitive function, particularly in Alzheimer's disease patients. Additionally, aromatherapy has been reported to reduce psychological distress and enhance symptom control in cancer patients, suggesting potential benefits for overall well-being. However, more research is needed to fully understand and establish the therapeutic effects of aromatherapy for elderly dementia patients.",NEI
Does tomato extract reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease?,Yes,"The consumption of tomato and tomato-based products has been consistently associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Epidemiological evidence suggests that the antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, and hypotensive effects of tomatoes contribute to their potential role in reducing CVD risk. The biological functions of tomato carotenoids, such as lycopene, phytoene, and phytofluene, are being investigated for their potential in reducing the risk of chronic diseases, including CVD and cancer. Intervention trials have shown that increasing the intake of tomato products and lycopene supplementation has positive effects on blood lipids, blood pressure, and endothelial function. Additionally, interventions supplementing tomato have been associated with significant reductions in LDL-cholesterol, IL-6, and improvements in FMD, while lycopene supplementation has been shown to reduce systolic blood pressure. Overall, the available evidence supports the view that tomato extract reduces the risk of CVD.",NEI
Does quitting smoking prolong life?,Yes,"Quitting smoking has been demonstrated to prolong life, as evidenced by numerous studies. Smoking cessation significantly reduces the risk of premature mortality, with individuals who quit smoking before age 35 having mortality rates similar to those who never smoked. The life expectancy of smokers who quit at age 35 exceeds that of continuing smokers by 6.9 to 8.5 years for men and 6.1 to 7.7 years for women. Moreover, even those who quit much later in life, such as at age 65, still gain significant benefits, with men gaining 1.4 to 2.0 years of life and women gaining 2.7 to 3.7 years. The mortality hazards of smoking extend well into later life, suggesting that smoking cessation will continue to improve life expectancy in older people. Therefore, quitting smoking at any age is beneficial to health and prolongs life.",Yes
Does eating eggs increase the risk of cardiovascular disease?,NEI,"(Not Enough Information)

Evidence regarding the association between egg consumption and cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains controversial and inconclusive. While some meta-analyses suggest a positive correlation between egg consumption and increased CVD risk, other studies dispute these findings. Moderate egg consumption has not been consistently linked to a significant increase in CVD, stroke, heart failure, or type 2 diabetes mellitus. However, a higher intake of dietary cholesterol or eggs has been associated with a higher risk of incident CVD and all-cause mortality in a dose-response manner. The relationship between egg and cholesterol intakes and heart failure risk is still largely unknown. It is important to note that diverse healthy populations may not experience an increased risk of coronary heart disease with increased cholesterol intake, and eggs may have multiple beneficial effects when included in a regular diet. Nevertheless, higher quality studies are warranted to obtain stronger evidence for the possible protective effects of moderate weekly egg consumption or the increased heart failure risk associated with high regular egg consumption.",No
"Does oseltamivir (brand name ""Tamiflu"") reduce the severity and duration of influenza in otherwise healthy adults?",Yes,"Oseltamivir (Tamiflu) has been shown to reduce the severity and duration of influenza in otherwise healthy adults. In a study involving 2288 patients, of whom 1575 (69%) had confirmed influenza, oseltamivir treatment reduced the mean time to symptom alleviation by 1.08 days (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.58-1.59). Furthermore, oseltamivir significantly reduced the duration of fever (weighted mean difference [WMD], -20.48; 95% CI, -28.43, -12.53) and influenza-like symptoms (WMD, -19.39; 95% CI, -32.94, -5.84). These findings suggest that oseltamivir is an effective treatment for reducing the severity and duration of influenza in otherwise healthy adults. However, it should be noted that oseltamivir treatment may increase the occurrence of nausea and vomiting.",NEI
"Is active surveillance (""active surveillance"") of patients with low-risk prostate cancer associated with increased prostate cancer mortality risk in the long term?",No,"Active surveillance is not associated with increased prostate cancer mortality risk in the long term for men with low-risk prostate cancer. This approach involves regular monitoring of the cancer through serum prostate-specific antigen tests and repeat prostate biopsies. The aim is to avoid radical treatment and its side-effects in men who have truly low-risk prostate cancer, while offering radical treatment to those men who are at higher risk of local progression or metastatic disease. Active surveillance is increasingly recognized as the preferred standard of care for men with low-risk prostate cancer and is an important management strategy for men diagnosed with low-risk prostate cancer. The goal is to reduce overtreatment of favorable risk prostate cancer and to address the problem of overdiagnosis and overtreatment of clinically insignificant disease.",NEI
"Does Active Surveillance reduce the likelihood of becoming impotent or incontinence, i.e. unintentional urine leakage ??",NEI,"The context provided does not contain sufficient information to definitively determine whether active surveillance reduces the likelihood of becoming impotent or experiencing urinary incontinence. Active surveillance is a strategy for managing prostate cancer that involves closely monitoring the disease for signs of progression and only intervening with treatment when necessary. The context does not discuss the relationship between active surveillance and the risk of impotence or urinary incontinence. Therefore, it is not possible to make a definitive statement on this topic based on the information provided. Further research would be needed to determine the impact of active surveillance on these outcomes.",Yes
Do extracts of prickly pear (Opuntia ficus-indica) help with hangover symptoms after alcohol consumption?,Yes,"The extracts of prickly pear (Opuntia ficus-indica) have been shown to possess therapeutic effects, including antioxidant, antimicrobial, and anticancer properties, due to their high content of bioactive compounds such as betalain pigments and polyphenols including flavonoids. These extracts have been introduced as reducing hangover symptoms and liver protective activity. Furthermore, studies have demonstrated that the pear extract decreased the alcohol level in blood regardless of ALDH2 genotype. The fruits of Opuntia have also been found to produce analgesic and anti-inflammatory action in a dose-dependent manner. Therefore, the consistent in vitro and in vivo data suggest that prickly pear extracts could be a potential source of natural compounds and a promising therapeutic agent for the research of new natural active ingredients to help with hangover symptoms after alcohol consumption.",NEI
Do statins help older people suffering from cardiovascular disease to live longer? Do they reduce the risk of heart attack and stroke?,Yes,"Justification: Statins have been shown to be beneficial in reducing the risk of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and major adverse cardiovascular events in older people with coronary artery disease and hypercholesterolemia. They have also been effective in reducing the incidence of myocardial infarction and stroke in elderly subjects at high cardiovascular risk without established cardiovascular disease. However, the long-term survival benefits of statins in elderly patients are not fully established. Nonetheless, the available evidence suggests that statins can help older people with cardiovascular disease live longer and reduce their risk of heart attack and stroke.",NEI
Are statins useful in preventing cardiovascular disease in people 75 years and older???,Yes,", with caveats.

Statins have been shown to be effective in reducing the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events in elderly patients, including those aged 75 years and older. This is supported by evidence from numerous large randomized clinical trials. However, it is important to note that the role of statins in primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in this age group remains a subject of debate, with limited evidence to support or exclude the benefit of this treatment. Additionally, the efficacy and safety of statins in elderly patients with frailty is uncertain. Therefore, while statins can be useful in preventing cardiovascular disease in people 75 years and older, individual patient characteristics and risk factors should be carefully considered before initiating treatment.",NEI
"Is Traumeel gel or ointment effective for sports injuries such as sprains, bruises and strains?",Yes,"In a multicentre, randomised, blinded, active-control and non-inferiority study, Traumeel ointment (t-o) and Traumeel gel (t-g) were compared to diclofenac gel (d-g) in the management of acute ankle sprains. The results demonstrated that t-o and t-g decreased pain and improved joint function to the same extent as d-g in acute ankle sprain, and were well tolerated. The study aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of Traumeel injections versus corticosteroid injections and placebo in the treatment of rotator cuff syndrome and bursitis. Mann-Whitney effect sizes and lower bound confidence intervals demonstrated non-inferiority of Traumeel vs. diclofenac for reducing pain and functional improvement. These findings suggest that Traumeel gel or ointment can be effective for sports injuries such as sprains, bruises and strains.",NEI
Are weather phenomena and weather changes triggers of migraine attacks?,Yes,"Scientific studies have shown a correlation between specific meteorological variables and the prevalence and intensity of migraine attacks. A subgroup of migraineurs has been found to be highly sensitive to changes in certain weather components, with a significant weather sensitivity observed. Higher relative humidity has been associated with higher odds of migraine headache onset in warm seasons, while traffic-related gaseous pollutants may be associated with higher odds of migraine headache onset in cold seasons. In addition, a ridge of high pressure has been found to increase the risk of headache occurrence, lower mean daily wind speed increases the risk of migraine occurrence, and a day-to-day change of daily sunshine duration increases the risk of migraine occurrence. Although the specific weather component(s) responsible for triggering migraines are not yet fully understood, these findings suggest that weather phenomena and weather changes can indeed act as triggers for migraine attacks.",No
Does artichoke preparation help with gastrointestinal problems?,Yes,"Artichoke preparations have been demonstrated to be beneficial in managing gastrointestinal problems, particularly constipation. A trial evaluating the effects of probiotic-enriched artichokes on constipated subjects revealed a significant positive impact on symptoms, with satisfactory relief of symptoms being higher during the probiotic-enriched artichoke period (p = 0.0014). The supplementation of artichoke and artichoke products, in a non-co-supplementation form, has been found to be effective in reducing homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) (p = 0.002). Furthermore, the administration of artichoke and artichoke products has led to a significant reduction in fasting blood sugar (FBS) (p = 0.005). The bioaccessibility and gut bioavailability of artichoke constituents have been evaluated, and the results suggest that artichoke polyphenols can modulate in vitro starch digestibility. These findings support the use of artichoke preparations as a potential intervention for gastrointestinal disorders.",NEI
Does prickly pear help with long-term weight loss?,Yes,"The scientific evidence suggests that prickly pear can aid in long-term weight loss. In a study, prickly pear pectin intake was found to decrease plasma LDL concentrations by increasing hepatic apolipoprotein B/E receptor expression in guinea pigs fed a hypercholesterolemic diet. This indicates that the decreased plasma and hepatic cholesterol concentrations of animals fed prickly pear pectin are not explained by differences in cholesterol absorption but rather are due to mechanisms that alter hepatic cholesterol homeostasis, resulting in lower plasma LDL concentrations. Additionally, waist circumference was significantly reduced at 12 weeks in the pear group compared to the control group, suggesting that prickly pear consumption may promote modest improvements in cardiometabolic health. The results demonstrate the potential benefits of PGX fiber, which is derived from prickly pear, in controlling the frequency of eating and in weight loss. Therefore, it can be inferred that prickly pear can aid in long-term weight loss.",NEI
Can turmeric relieve the symptoms of depression?,NEI,"The context provided does not contain direct evidence or studies regarding the effect of turmeric on depression symptoms.

However, the context does not mention any research or findings related to turmeric's potential impact on depression. Therefore, more information is needed to definitively answer this question.",NEI
Do phthalates affect semen quality in men?,Yes,"Evidence suggests that phthalate exposure, including exposure from prescription drugs, may impair human semen quality. Studies involving infertile men seeking care have shown that phthalates can influence measures of semen quality, raising concerns for men in the general population. Results from a study in a Chinese population indicate that semen phthalate metabolites are significantly associated with decreases in semen volume, sperm curvilinear velocity, and straight-line velocity, as well as an increased percentage of abnormal heads and tails. Furthermore, an association between current use of phthalate-containing medications and reduced semen quality has been found. These findings support the likely negative effect of phthalate exposure from medicinal drugs on semen quality.",NEI
Do phthalates reduce the likelihood of pregnancy in women?,Yes,", with caveats.

     Phthalates have been shown to potentially alter the risk of hormonally-mediated diseases among reproductive-age women, and exposure during gestation has been associated with decreased birth weight among offspring. Certain phthalates and bisphenol A (BPA) have been found to show reproductive effects in animal studies and potentially affect human ovulation, conception, and pregnancy loss. Additionally, menstrual cycle-specific estimates of urinary BPA and phthalate metabolites were not associated with detrimental alterations in follicular-phase length, time to pregnancy, or early pregnancy loss, and in fact, di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) metabolites were associated with reduced early loss. However, the findings regarding female exposure to monoethyl phthalate (MEP) and its potential adverse effect on female fecundity need to be replicated in a larger and newer cohort study with sufficient exposure contrast. It is important to note that the mechanism behind the relationship between phthalate exposure and reduced birth weight is unknown.",Yes
Does ginseng improve mental performance in healthy individuals and patients with Alzheimer's dementia?,Yes,", for Alzheimer's dementia patients; Insufficient evidence for healthy individuals

The evidence suggests that ginseng, specifically Panax ginseng, has shown potential efficacy in improving cognitive function in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). The active components of ginseng, such as ginsenosides, gintonin, and compound K, have been found to be pharmacologically efficacious in various preclinical studies related to cognitive impairment. The study reported improvements in cognitive performance, as measured by the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS), in AD patients after 12 weeks of ginseng treatment. However, there is currently a lack of convincing evidence to show a cognitive enhancing effect of Panax ginseng in healthy individuals, and no high-quality evidence about its efficacy in patients with dementia. Therefore, while there is evidence supporting the use of ginseng in AD patients, further research is needed to determine its effects on cognitive performance in healthy individuals and those with dementia.",Yes
Does leaky gut syndrome cause health complaints or diseases?,Yes,"The phenomenon of 'leaky gut,' or increased intestinal permeability, has been identified in various intestinal and extra-intestinal diseases. Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, are characterized by an impaired gut-blood barrier, leading to a leaky gut. Although leaky gut is not the sole cause of these diseases, it is believed to play a significant role in their manifestation, along with disordered gut function, including abnormalities in motility and visceral sensory function.

Functional gastrointestinal disorders, such as functional dyspepsia (FD) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), are also common pathologies of the gut, characterized by chronic abdominal symptoms in the absence of an organic, metabolic, or systemic cause. IBS, the most common functional disorder in the gut, consists of a variable combination of symptoms, including abdominal pain, bloating, and altered bowel habits.

Possible shared pathophysiologic mechanisms in these disorders include altered mucosal permeability, an altered interaction of luminal flora with the mucosal immune system, persistent mucosal immune activation, alterations in gut motility, and a role of severe, sustained life stressors in symptom modulation.

While leaky gut syndrome alone may not directly cause diseases, it is a significant factor contributing to various health complaints and symptoms associated with intestinal and extra-intestinal diseases. It is essential to consider the complex interplay of factors involved in these disorders when evaluating and treating patients with gastrointestinal symptoms.",NEI

Geraniol has been shown to exhibit anti-inflammatory activities, inhibiting the expression of inflammatory markers such as tnf-α, il-1β, and il-6. Additionally, geraniol treatment was able to suppress biomarkers associated with allergic rhinitis (ar), a condition that can cause symptoms similar to those of colds and sinusitis. Furthermore, geranium oil has been used traditionally for treating diarrhea, dermatitis, and intestinal inflammation, suggesting its potential for managing symptoms associated with colds and sinusitis. However, more research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms by which geranium extract may help alleviate these conditions.",NEI
Does taking DHEA have an anti-aging effect by increasing the physical and mental well-being of older people?,Yes,"Evidence suggests that DHEA (dehydroepiandrosterone) supplementation may have an anti-aging effect by increasing physical and mental well-being in older individuals. DHEA is a hormone produced by the adrenal glands and its levels decrease with age. Supplementation with DHEA has been shown to produce a number of beneficial effects in the elderly, including increased muscle and bone mass and strength, decreased fat, and improved immunologic and neurobehavioral functions. Additionally, DHEA has been associated with several health parameters related to aging, such as cognitive function, bone mineral density, and muscular strength. However, it is important to note that while DHEA may have potential benefits, its possible deleterious side effects have not been fully assessed. Therefore, further research is needed to fully understand the potential risks and benefits of DHEA supplementation.",NEI
Can DHEA prolong life or improve health in old age?,NEI,"Justification: The context suggests that Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) has been studied for its potential anti-aging effects and has been shown to produce beneficial effects in the elderly. It has been suggested that DHEA might be able to temporarily slow down the aging process and has promising uses in age-related illnesses such as osteoporosis and atherosclerosis. However, the context also states that DHEA can only delay and correct age-related disorders to a certain degree and that there is limited scientific data on its effects. Therefore, it is not possible to definitively conclude that DHEA can prolong life or improve health in old age based on the information provided. Further research is needed to fully understand the potential benefits and limitations of DHEA supplementation.",NEI
Can the proper use of fluoride toothpaste cause serious long-term health problems?,No,"The proper use of fluoride toothpaste, as per the information provided, does not appear to cause serious long-term health problems. Fluoride is known to be beneficial for dental health and is an effective caries prophylactic. However, it is important to note that excessive intake of fluoride can lead to fluorosis, which is associated with dental, skeletal, and soft tissue fluorosis. Prolonged ingestion of fluoride can adversely affect teeth, bones, and other organs, and chronic exposure to high doses can result in dental enamel and skeletal and soft tissue fluorosis. It is also suggested that overexposure to fluoride can induce cytotoxicity and regulate relevant genes expression. However, these negative effects are associated with excessive intake or overexposure to fluoride, not the proper use of fluoride toothpaste. The proper use of fluoride toothpaste involves using a pea-sized amount for brushing and spitting out the toothpaste after brushing, rather than swallowing it. Therefore, based on the information provided, the proper use of fluoride toothpaste does not appear to cause serious long-term health problems.",NEI
Does fluoride toothpaste prevent tooth decay?,Yes,"Fluoride toothpaste is clinically proven to prevent tooth decay. Its efficacy in caries prevention is attributed to the presence of fluoride in the enamel, which protects teeth against carious attack. The regular use of fluoride toothpaste has been shown to reduce the rate of caries development, making it an important public health measure for preventing caries and gingivitis. The clinical success of fluoride toothpaste in preventing tooth decay is further supported by studies that demonstrate considerable salivary fluoride retention after brushing with fluoride dentifrices. Additionally, fluoride dissolving from topically treated enamel reduces acid production in covering layers of oral bacteria, further contributing to its anticaries benefits. However, it is important to note that the use of fluoride toothpaste is not without risks, as ingestion of fluoride from toothpastes may contribute to the total intake of this element, potentially leading to dental fluorosis. Nevertheless, the overall benefits of fluoride toothpaste in preventing tooth decay are well-established and widely accepted.",Yes

A mangosteen-based formula has been shown to significantly increase antioxidant capacity and provide anti-inflammatory benefits, with no observed side effects on immune, hepatic, and renal functions during long-term consumption. Additionally, mangosteen extract has been found to protect various human organs, such as the liver, skin, joints, eyes, neurons, bowel, and cardiovascular tissues, against disorders and diseases. These beneficial effects are attributed to the presence of xanthones, the major components of mangosteen fruit.",NEI
"Are topical agents containing acids and oils, such as Excilor and Nailner, effective for nail fungus?",Yes,"The results suggest that organic acids present in Excilor (acetic acid, ethyl lactate) and Nailner (lactic acid, citric acid, ethyl lactate) play a significant role in their antifungal effect against nail fungus. All tested formulations without organic acids were found to be inactive. Furthermore, these topical agents have been formulated to provide better delivery of the antifungal agent to the nail unit. The application of antifungal lacquer to fingernail and toenail fungal infections has been shown to be an effective topical therapy for the treatment of less severe forms of onychomycosis. The use of antifungal nail lacquers in combination with oral agents, such as terbinafine and itraconazole, improves the efficacy of antifungal therapy. The rapid nail penetration of cpx, provided by the application of the cpx/sol nail lacquer, allows for sufficient levels to inhibit fungal growth for a prolonged period of time (30 hours) after application of lacquer dose. In conclusion, topical agents containing acids and oils, such as Excilor and Nailner, have been demonstrated to be effective for the treatment of nail fungus.",NEI
Can weight loss programs reduce obesity in children and adolescents?,Yes,"Evidence from several randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses suggests that lifestyle intervention programs, which include diet, physical activity, and behavioral modifications, are effective in reducing obesity in children and adolescents. These interventions have been shown to induce weight loss and improve body composition in the short term. However, long-term maintenance of weight loss remains a challenge. Multidisciplinary programs that involve medical, psychological, and nutritional sessions have been found to be particularly effective in achieving long-term weight loss. Early prevention and treatment of childhood and adolescent obesity is crucial, and interventions should involve a combination of lifestyle changes, including strategies to reduce energy intake, increase physical activity, reduce sedentary activities, facilitate family involvement, and change behaviors associated with eating and physical activity. Despite the challenges in maintaining weight loss over the long term, weight loss programs have been shown to be effective in reducing obesity in children and adolescents.",NEI
Does valerian help with sleep disorders?,Yes,"Valerian (Valeriana officinalis) has been proposed to be an effective herb for promoting sleep and preventing associated disorders. Its usage as a traditional medicine for improving sleep quality and treating mild sleep disorders has been widely documented. The herb has been advocated for its sedative/hypnotic properties and is considered a safe choice for patients with mild to moderate insomnia. Valerian has been shown to improve subjective experiences of sleep when taken nightly over one- to two-week periods. Preclinical studies suggest that valerian has sedative and muscle-relaxant effects, which may contribute to its sleep-enhancing properties. It is also proposed that the anxiolytic and antidepressant activity of valerian may contribute to its sleep-enhancing properties. However, it is important to note that the outcomes of previous clinical studies are inconsistent, and more research is needed to fully understand the effects of valerian on sleep disorders.",Yes
Is milk thistle extract an effective treatment for liver disease?,NEI,"Milk thistle extract, derived from the plant Silybum marianum, has been used historically as a ""liver tonic"" and is widely used as an alternative therapy for liver disease due to its purported antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and iron chelating properties. Preliminary clinical evaluations suggest potential benefits in healthier patients with alcoholic cirrhosis. However, the current body of evidence is insufficient to definitively establish the effectiveness of milk thistle extract as a treatment for liver disease. While some studies indicate that milk thistle may reduce liver enzyme levels and demonstrate anti-inflammatory and T cell-modulating effects, other studies question its beneficial effects for patients with alcoholic and/or hepatitis B or C virus liver diseases. Furthermore, high-quality evidence supporting the use of milk thistle extract for liver disease treatment is lacking. Therefore, it is not possible to conclusively determine the efficacy of milk thistle extract as a treatment for liver disease based on the available evidence.",Yes
Do dietary supplements with amino acids and proteins help against muscle atrophy in old age (sarcopenia)?,Yes,"Recent scientific discoveries have shown that dietary supplements containing specific amino acids and proteins can indeed aid in counteracting age-related muscle loss, known as sarcopenia. The intake of these nutrients has been demonstrated to stimulate muscle protein synthesis and enhance mitochondrial function in the elderly. A combination of arginine, lysine, and beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate (HMB) has been investigated for its potential to slow muscle breakdown and improve strength and functionality in older individuals. Moreover, branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) have been suggested to alleviate sarcopenia by promoting muscle protein synthesis and improving iron status. Nutritional supplements can also help sarcopenic elderly more conveniently meet their protein requirements. However, the effect of protein and amino acid supplementation on muscle strength and physical function can be variable, and it remains unclear whether increasing dietary protein intake corrects postabsorptive muscle changes in aging. Nonetheless, protein supplementation is generally suggested to improve muscle anabolism and function in both younger and older adults.",Yes
Can music therapy help people affected by stroke learn to walk normally again?,Yes,"Evidence suggests that music therapy can contribute to the rehabilitation of movement, including walking, in individuals affected by stroke. Musical rhythmicity has been observed to improve post-stroke gait, and individualized in-patient rehabilitation interventions that incorporate music have been shown to improve balance and gait in stroke patients. Music-based therapy for rehabilitation has been found to induce neuromodulation at the brain level and improve functional recovery. Furthermore, arrhythmic music listening has been shown to modulate spinal excitability during post-stroke walking, restoring CPQ reflex activity to normality. These findings support the potential of music therapy as a feasible intervention for improving motor functions, including walking, in stroke patients.",Yes
Can music therapy help stroke victims with other problems???,Yes,"Evidence suggests that music therapy can potentially aid stroke victims in managing other problems beyond motor rehabilitation. Music-supported therapy (MST) has been shown to improve motor function after stroke, with electrophysiological changes indicating better cortical connectivity and improved activation of the motor cortex. Moreover, MST integrates principles of motor training and multimodal stimulation, which may contribute to its effectiveness in stroke rehabilitation. Although the empirical evidence for music therapy's impact on mood states in individuals with neurological impairments is currently limited, it has been demonstrated to improve mood states in various populations. This suggests that music therapy may have the potential to address emotional and psychosocial aspects of stroke recovery, in addition to its motor-related benefits.",NEI
Does plant or animal protein have an influence on lifespan?,Yes,"The type of dietary protein, whether plant or animal-based, has been shown to influence lifespan through various mechanisms. Research suggests that an optimal lifespan requires both high carbohydrate and low protein consumption, with the ratio of protein to carbohydrate (P:C) in the diet playing a significant role. As the P:C ratio declines, life span increases in certain organisms such as Drosophila. Furthermore, proteins from plant-based sources may have different effects on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors compared to animal-based proteins. This is due to the unique composite of nonprotein compounds present in each food source, which can also affect CVD risk factors. While it is difficult to isolate the specific role of plant or animal protein on CVD risk, life-history theory predicts that nutrition influences lifespan through trade-offs between allocating resources to reproduction, growth, and repair. Additionally, oxidatively modified proteins have been shown to correlate with the age of an organism or its tissues, further emphasizing the importance of protein source in determining lifespan.",Yes
Does chicken soup help with colds?,Yes,"The present study suggests that chicken soup may contain a number of substances with beneficial medicinal activity, including a mild anti-inflammatory effect. This effect could potentially mitigate the symptoms of upper respiratory tract infections, such as those associated with the common cold. The study found that chicken soup significantly inhibited neutrophil migration, a key component of the inflammatory response, in a concentration-dependent manner. Furthermore, all of the vegetables present in the soup and the chicken individually had inhibitory activity, although only the chicken lacked cytotoxic activity. The activity was present in a nonparticulate component of the chicken soup. These findings support the notion that chicken soup may be beneficial in alleviating the symptoms of colds.",NEI
"Do herbal remedies containing an extract of Chinese tragacanth root, such as Lectranal or Allvent, help against allergies?",Yes,"Herbal remedies containing an extract of Chinese tragacanth root, such as Lectranal or Allvent, have been shown to possess anti-allergic properties. The traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) system has employed various herbal formulae in treating and preventing diseases, including asthma and allergies. Specifically, the herbal compound Chung-Sang-Bo-Ha-Tang (CSBHT) has been used therapeutically for centuries to treat asthma patients. Additionally, Mahuang Fuzi Xixin Decoction (MFXD), another TCM, is used to treat allergic rhinitis (AR), though its active ingredients and potential targets remain unclear. Furthermore, plants like Rosa roxburghii tratt and Fagopyrum cymosum are reputed to have benefits in improving immune responses, which can help combat allergies. Together, these findings suggest that herbal remedies containing Chinese tragacanth root extract may indeed be effective against allergies.",Yes
Does alkaline water keep you healthy or can it prevent disease?,Yes,", with caveats.

The consumption of alkaline water has been studied for its potential health benefits and disease prevention properties. Research suggests that alkaline water supplementation can improve aging at the molecular level and positively impact various aspects of health. The review contends that ""healthy"" water, in terms of electrolyte balance, is as important as ""pure"" water in promoting public health. Consumption of hard water is presumed to protect against the development of arteriosclerotic diseases. Furthermore, the use of alkaline solutions for irrigation of the urinary tract may be beneficial in dissolving uric acid stones. However, it is important to note that further research is needed to fully understand the biological importance and roles of electrolyte abnormalities in promoting, antagonizing, or otherwise enabling the development of diseases such as cancer. Therefore, while alkaline water may have potential health benefits and disease prevention properties, it is not a cure-all and should be considered as part of a holistic approach to health.",NEI
Do remedies with hops or valerian help with anxiety disorders?,Yes,"Remedies containing hops or valerian have been shown to be beneficial for addressing anxiety disorders. Hops (Humulus lupulus) have been traditionally used in European medicine as a mild sedative for treating anxiety, nervousness, and insomnia. The German Commission E has approved hops for anxiety/mood disorders and restlessness. In young adults reporting mild depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms, daily supplementation with a hops dry extract significantly improved these symptoms over a 4-week period, as evidenced by decreased DASS-21 anxiety, depression, and stress scores. These improvements were significantly greater compared to those caused by a placebo. Additionally, valerian preparations, alone or in combination with hops, are popular over-the-counter products used for sleep disturbances or anxiety. Further research on the biological targets of hop dietary supplements and their phytoconstituents may lead to standardized botanical products with higher efficacy, safety, and chemopreventive properties.",NEI
Do extracts of African devil's claw (Harpagophytum procumbens) relieve pain in patients with osteoarthritis?,Yes,"Harpagophytum procumbens, commonly known as devil's claw, has been used in traditional medicine for the treatment of a wide range of conditions, including pain and arthritis. Preparations made from the secondary tubers of devil's claw are successfully used in patients with rheumatic diseases, such as arthrosis and low back pain. An open clinical study suggests that devil's claw extract has a clinically beneficial effect in the treatment of arthrosis of the hip or knee. The iridoid glycoside, harpagoside, found in the root extracts of devil's claw, has been found to be effective in the treatment of degenerative rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, tendonitis, kidney inflammation, and heart disease. Considering its excellent tolerance profile, devil's claw may be a valuable and safe alternative to NSAIDs in patients suffering from degenerative joint diseases.",NEI
Can probiotics prevent diarrhea after treatment with antibiotics?,Yes,"Scientific Explanation: Probiotics, which are living microorganisms, have been shown to have beneficial effects in managing diarrheal diseases. Specifically, certain probiotic microorganisms have been indicated to reduce the risk of antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) by restoring the gut microflora. This restoration is achieved through the normalization of an unbalanced gastrointestinal flora, which can occur due to antibiotic treatment. The role of probiotics in preventing and treating AAD, Clostridium difficile diarrhea, and recurrent C. difficile diarrhea has been reviewed, with evidence suggesting a strong benefit of probiotic administration. However, it is important to note that convincing evidence is limited to certain microorganisms, and further data is needed to fully evaluate the efficacy of probiotics in preventing AAD. Nonetheless, probiotics have been advocated for use in preventing diarrhea that is a common adverse effect of antibiotic use, and clinical studies have shown that certain probiotics may be useful in treating a variety of diarrheal disorders.",Yes
Is exercise an effective measure to combat depression?,Yes,"Exercise has been established as an efficacious treatment for depression, supported by both consumers and clinicians. Studies have demonstrated that exercise, regardless of intensity, can significantly improve depressed mood. Compared to no treatment, placebo, or active control interventions such as relaxation or meditation, exercise is associated with a greater reduction in depression symptoms. Exercise has also been studied as a potential antidepressant, with most studies supporting its efficacy. In particular, aerobic exercise has been shown to alleviate depression. Furthermore, exercise has the potential to reduce the risk for physical comorbidities that occur with depression. The efficacy of physical exercise as an augmentation to pharmacotherapy with antidepressants for depressive patients has been documented. Exercise improves cardiorespiratory fitness and reduces depressive symptoms in people with depression.",NEI
Can a tantrum trigger a heart attack?,Yes,"Justification: The context suggests that physical and emotional triggers, such as psychological stress, can contribute to acute coronary syndrome. Tantrums, characterized by intense emotional outbursts, could potentially trigger a heart attack due to the associated emotional stress. This emotional stress can lead to a surge in catecholamines, which can cause myocardial damage and induce the synthesis of cytokines with cardiodepressant properties, such as TNF-alpha. This could result in cardiac dysfunction and potentially a heart attack. However, it is important to note that individual susceptibility to such triggers can vary based on factors such as pre-existing conditions and overall health.",No
Can anger over a long period of time increase the risk of heart attack???,Yes,"The systematic review of studies suggests a significant association between anger and increased risk of heart attacks, strokes, and disturbances in cardiac rhythm. The evidence indicates that outbursts of anger, particularly in individuals with a strong, angry temperament, can trigger an abrupt increase in cardiovascular events, including acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and ventricular arrhythmias. While the context primarily focuses on the short-term effects of anger, the evidence of anger as a psychosocial risk factor for coronary heart disease implies that prolonged exposure to anger may also contribute to an increased risk of heart attacks. This is further supported by the finding that each unit increase in the outward expression of anger increases the risk for cardiac death or a new AMI by 42%. Therefore, it can be inferred that anger over a long period of time may indeed increase the risk of heart attacks.",NEI
Can capsules with omega-3 fatty acids from fish oil relieve depression?,Inconclusive,"The potential therapeutic benefits of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids derived from fish in depression have been suggested by various studies. However, the evidence remains inconclusive. While some research indicates that omega-3 fatty acids may have aetiological importance in depression and can be effective as monotherapy or adjunctive treatment, other studies have not found evidence that fish oil improves mood compared to placebo, despite an increase in circulating omega-3 fatty acids. The specific dose and type of fish oil used in a study may also impact its effectiveness. Furthermore, the large dose required to achieve and sustain certain effects, such as lowering cholesterol levels, may limit long-term compliance. Overall, further research is needed to determine the efficacy of omega-3 fatty acid supplementation in relieving depression.",NEI
Does regular consumption of coffee increase the risk of heart disease such as heart attack or stroke?,Yes,"Evidence suggests that regular consumption of coffee, particularly heavy intake, is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, including heart attack and stroke. Chronic coffee consumption has been linked to cardiac arrhythmia, elevated serum cholesterol, blood pressure, and affected heart rate variability, all of which contribute to an increased cardiovascular risk. Heavy coffee consumption has been found to increase the short-term risk of acute myocardial infarction or coronary death, independent of brewing method or recognized risk factors for coronary heart disease. Furthermore, coffee drinking may have an acute detrimental effect in triggering coronary events and increasing infarct size in selected patient groups. However, it is important to note that moderate coffee consumption is unlikely to adversely affect cardiovascular health in most healthy individuals.",Yes
Do cesarean babies have a higher risk of becoming overweight later in life?,Yes,"Evidence suggests that children delivered by cesarean have a higher risk of being overweight throughout childhood compared to those delivered vaginally. This is supported by a 52% increased risk and a 1.52 higher odds of being overweight in the cesarean delivery group. Furthermore, infants born heavy are vulnerable to later obesity, and greater antenatal weight or body mass index gains may lead to larger fetuses and thus increase the risk for operative deliveries, such as cesarean deliveries. Additionally, mothers who gave birth by cesarean delivery had a higher mean prepregnancy body mass index and greater mean gestational weight gain compared to those who delivered vaginally.",NEI
Do cesarean babies have a higher risk of asthma and allergies later in life? Do they have an increased risk of type 1 diabetes??,Yes,"Epidemiological studies and meta-analyses have consistently demonstrated that children born via cesarean section have an increased risk of developing asthma and allergies later in life compared to those born via vaginal delivery. The association between cesarean delivery and asthma is particularly strong, with children delivered by cesarean section having a higher likelihood of current asthma at 36 months of age. The risk is even greater among children of nonatopic mothers.

Furthermore, cesarean delivery has been linked to an increased risk of allergic rhinitis and atopy among children with a parental history of asthma or allergies. It is hypothesized that cesarean delivery may alter neonatal immune responses and increase the risk of atopy by delaying microbial colonization.

Regarding type 1 diabetes, studies have shown that children born via cesarean section have a higher risk of developing this autoimmune disorder compared to those born via vaginal delivery. However, the association between cesarean delivery and type 1 diabetes remains controversial and requires further investigation.

In summary, based on the available evidence, it can be concluded that cesarean babies have a higher risk of asthma and allergies later in life and may also have an increased risk of type 1 diabetes.",Yes
Does the pregnancy hormone hCG help with weight loss?,No,"Justification: The context provided suggests that while human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) hormone has been observed to accelerate weight loss in the treatment of hypothalamic dysfunction in obesity, it does not appear to have a significant advantage on weight reduction when administered in addition to diet in rats. Furthermore, the context indicates that even though participants in the intervention group lost more weight before pregnancy than those in the control group, the intervention group was associated with greater weight gain in late pregnancy. Therefore, it can be concluded that the pregnancy hormone hCG does not necessarily help with weight loss.",No
Does cupping relieve chronic neck and back pain?,Yes,"Evidence suggests that dry cupping therapy is effective in reducing pain associated with chronic neck and back pain. Low-quality evidence revealed that dry cupping had a significant effect on pain reduction for chronic neck pain (md, -21.67; 95% ci, -36.55, to -6.80) and low back pain (md, -19.38; 95%ci, -28.09, to -10.66). Moderate-quality evidence suggested that dry cupping improved functional status for chronic neck pain (md, -4.65; 95%ci, -6.44, to -2.85). Furthermore, a single session of dry cupping therapy may be an effective short-term treatment method for immediately reducing pain and increasing oxygenated and total hemoglobin levels in patients with nonspecific neck pain. Cupping therapy has been widely used in various traditional medicine forms to relieve pain in musculoskeletal diseases, and initial scientific evidence indicates that dry cupping is able to reduce musculoskeletal pain.",NEI
Can eating broccoli or broccoli sprouts improve gastritis symptoms?,Yes,"Evidence suggests that broccoli consumption, particularly broccoli sprouts, may improve gastrointestinal health due to their impact on the composition and function of the human gastrointestinal microbiota. Broccoli sprouts have been shown to eradicate Helicobacter pylori infection, a common cause of gastritis, in three of nine patients. Furthermore, broccoli sprouts are rich in antioxidant and anti-inflammatory phytochemicals, which may help reduce inflammation and oxidative stress in the gastrointestinal tract. Additionally, dietary broccoli has been associated with heightened intestinal AHR activity, decreased microbial abundance of the family Erysipelotrichaceae, and attenuation of colitis, suggesting a potential role in improving gastrointestinal health. Therefore, it is plausible that consuming broccoli or broccoli sprouts may improve gastritis symptoms.",Yes
Do Schuessler salts work? (alternative spellings: Schuessler salts or Schuessler salts),NEI,"Justification: The provided context does not explicitly mention Schuessler salts, their composition, or their therapeutic effects. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether Schuessler salts work based solely on the given information. The context does discuss the therapeutic effects of sulphate mineral waters and the effects of different salts on physiological parameters, mineral nutrient composition, and gene expression. However, this information does not directly address the question of whether Schuessler salts are effective. Further research and evidence are required to make a definitive conclusion about the efficacy of Schuessler salts.",No
Does pelvic floor training help women with stress-related urinary incontinence?,Yes,"Pelvic floor muscle training has been shown to be an effective treatment for stress urinary incontinence in women. This form of physical therapy is the most commonly used treatment for women with stress urinary incontinence and is currently considered as the first line conservative management for this condition. Pelvic floor muscle training has been shown to improve muscle strength, myoelectric activity, and precontraction of pelvic floor muscles, as well as improve quality of life in postmenopausal women with stress urinary incontinence. The mechanism of treatment action is not yet fully understood, but the widespread recommendation is that pelvic floor muscle training be included in first-line conservative management programs for women with stress, urge or mixed urinary incontinence.",No
Can methadone enhance the effects of chemotherapy or other cancer treatments and help cure cancer?,Yes,", with caveats.

Methadone, an analgesic drug, has been shown to sensitize various tumors to chemotherapy in preclinical in vitro and mouse studies. It has been suggested to induce cell death and sensitivity to chemo- or radiotherapy in leukemia, glioblastoma, and carcinoma cells. Methadone has also been found to elicit antitumor activity by downregulating the threshold of apoptosis and enhancing the effects of different chemotherapeutic agents. This supports the concept of using methadone as a chemosensitizer in future cancer treatment. However, it is important to note that there are currently no relevant clinical studies indicating that the use of methadone can prolong survival in cancer patients. Additionally, methadone's use as an antitumor treatment has been associated with problems in some patients. Therefore, while methadone has potential as a therapeutic agent against tumors, further research is needed to establish its efficacy and safety in cancer treatment.",NEI
Can treatment with tea tree oil relieve pimples (acne)?,Yes,"Scientific evidence supports the efficacy of tea tree oil in the treatment of mild to moderate acne vulgaris. Tea tree oil, derived from the plant Melaleuca alternifolia, possesses broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity, making it an increasingly popular choice for skin problems. Its antibacterial properties have been demonstrated in several published studies. Topical application of 5% tea tree oil has been shown to be an effective treatment for acne vulgaris, a disease of the pilosebaceous unit. Furthermore, tea tree oil has been found to reduce histamine-induced skin inflammation, suggesting potential anti-inflammatory properties. However, it is important to note that oxidation of tea tree oil can result in degradation products, such as ascaridole, which may cause allergic contact dermatitis. Therefore, while tea tree oil can relieve pimples, its use should be approached with caution due to potential side effects.",NEI
Does sugar consumption impair memory or other mental performance?,Yes,"Evidence from several studies suggests that high sugar intake is associated with impaired cognitive function. Specifically, research has shown that high-sugar diets can lead to decreased performance on tests assessing spatial learning and memory in rats. Furthermore, excessive sugar consumption has been linked to poor cognitive functions in older adults, with greater intake of total sugars being significantly associated with lower word list learning scores. Additionally, data indicates that sucrose consumption can induce deficits in spatial cognition and reward-oriented behavior, even at levels that resemble patterns of sugar drink consumption in young people. Importantly, cognitive impairments have been found when sugar intake approximates levels of sugar consumption in people, without changes to weight gain. These findings suggest that sugar consumption may indeed impair memory and other mental performance. However, longitudinal studies and clinical trials are needed to clarify the direction of causality and investigate the underlying mechanism.",NEI
Does extra folic acid in men help prevent birth defects in children?,Yes,"Evidence suggests that paternal folic acid intake is associated with a reduced risk of birth defects in children. High folate intake in men has been linked to lower frequencies of sperm with disomies X, 21, sex nullisomy, and a lower aggregate measure of sperm aneuploidy compared to men with lower intake. Furthermore, folic acid supplement users before pregnancy had a reduced risk of overall congenital heart defects compared to non-users. The anti-oxidation function of folic acid is one of the possible mechanisms involved in improving seminal parameters and pregnancy outcome. High-dose folic acid supplementation has also been shown to improve sperm parameters in infertile men. However, more research is needed to fully understand the effects of folic acid supplementation on the sperm epigenome.",No
Does taking ginger reduce nausea and vomiting during pregnancy?,Yes,"Recent clinical trials have indicated that ginger is an effective treatment for nausea and vomiting in pregnancy, particularly in the first trimester. The studies suggest that ginger may improve symptoms by about 4 points on a 40-point scale, or stop vomiting for 1 in 3 women at 6 days. Although the number of studies is limited and the quality of evidence is low, the potential benefits of ginger in reducing nausea symptoms in pregnancy are promising. Ginger is also a common traditional remedy taken by numerous women experiencing nausea and vomiting in pregnancy. However, further studies are needed to determine the proper dosage and confirm the safety of ginger for both the pregnant mother and her fetus.",Yes
Does taking ginger prevent motion sickness??,Yes,"Ginger has been shown to be an effective agent in the prevention and treatment of motion sickness. Its ability to ameliorate nausea associated with motion sickness is hypothesized to occur through the prevention of gastric dysrhythmias and the elevation of plasma vasopressin. This has been supported by numerous high-quality clinical studies, including a double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled study involving 13 volunteers with a history of motion sickness. In this study, ginger pretreatment effectively reduced nausea, tachygastric activity, and vasopressin release induced by circular vection. Additionally, ginger has been shown to prolong the latency before nausea onset and shorten the recovery time after vection cessation. These findings suggest that ginger can be a beneficial preventative measure for motion sickness.",NEI
Are electric cigarettes less harmful than tobacco smoking?,Yes,"Scientific evidence suggests that electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) are less harmful than traditional tobacco cigarettes due to the absence of a combustion process and the lack of tobacco-specific toxicants. E-cigarettes deliver nicotine in a vapor form, which does not contain the toxins found in tobacco smoke. This results in substantially lower levels of harmful carcinogens and other toxic compounds being generated, thus reducing exposure to selected tobacco-specific toxicants. However, it is important to note that misperceptions of relative harm are common, and e-cigarettes are not entirely risk-free. Furthermore, a significant association between e-cigarette use and lung disease has been found, which is modified by tobacco use. Therefore, while e-cigarettes are considered a less harmful alternative to traditional cigarettes, their use should still be approached with caution.",Yes
Does parents licking the pacifier protect children from allergic diseases?,Yes,"Evidence suggests that parental sucking of their infant's pacifier may reduce the risk of allergy development, potentially through immune stimulation by microbes transferred to the infant via the parent's saliva. In a study, children whose parents ""cleaned"" their pacifier by sucking it (n = 65) were less likely to have asthma (odds ratio [OR] 0.12; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.01-0.99), eczema (OR 0.37; 95% CI 0.15-0.91), and sensitization (OR 0.37; 95% CI 0.10-1.27) at 18 months of age than children whose parents did not use this cleaning technique (n = 58). The salivary microbiota differed between children whose parents cleaned their pacifier by sucking it and children whose parents did not use this practice. These findings suggest that parental pacifier sucking may provide a protective effect against allergic diseases in children.",NEI
Does calcium help with allergy?,Yes,"Calcium has been demonstrated to have a significant role in allergic reactions, as evidenced by its impact on the inhibition of allergen-induced swelling of the nasal mucosa in a placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover study. The study revealed that 1000 mg of calcium administered orally significantly reduced the swelling of the nasal mucosa in the allergen provocation test. Calcium ions have been found to play an important pathophysiologic role in allergic reactions, and calcium-binding proteins have been identified as a fixed component in the spectrum of allergenic substances. The binding of calcium ions to basophil and mast cell membranes is stimulated upon allergen binding to its specific membrane-bound IgE. Furthermore, the binding of a calcium ion can induce conformational changes and affect immunoglobulin E-binding to the allergen. Calcium is critical for airway smooth muscle contraction, degranulation of mast cells, and secretion of mucus. Therefore, the use of calcium channel blockers in the treatment of asthma has been of great interest and hope. The quantitative characterization of the binding to calcium is of importance to understand both the biologic and allergenic activity of these proteins. In vitro, calcium antagonists have been demonstrated to inhibit mediator release from mast cells, passively sensitized human lung fragments, and leukocytes. Therefore, it is likely that calcium antagonists would modify allergic bronchoconstriction.",NEI
Can taking vitamin D relieve chronic pain?,Yes,"Justification: The evidence suggests that increasing levels of vitamin D reduce inflammation, pain, and myopathy. As vitamin D levels increase, pain intensity decreases. Furthermore, vitamin D plus calcium has been found to have a moderate beneficial effect in reducing pain and improving physical performance compared to no therapy or calcium alone. Therefore, it can be inferred that taking vitamin D may help relieve chronic pain.",Yes
Does aloe vera relieve discomfort caused by psoriasis?,Yes,"Aloe vera has been traditionally used for the treatment of skin diseases, including psoriasis, and has been shown to have good results in treating various skin conditions. A systematic review of clinical trials assessing the effectiveness and safety of aloe for the treatment of psoriasis found that administration of aloe as a cutaneous treatment is generally well tolerated, with no serious side effects reported. Patients in the topical aloe cream group had significantly less postoperative pain at hours 12, 24, and 48 hours and at 2 weeks. Aloe vera is a medicinal plant that promotes wound healing in burn injuries and has been used for the prevention and cure of various diseases and symptoms including burns, injuries, edema, and pain. Many previous studies have reported the healing effects of aloe vera. Both aloe vera gel and cape aloe extract have been shown to significantly improve wound healing in human primary epidermal keratinocytes and a human skin equivalent model. Aloe vera has also been claimed to have anti-inflammatory effects, and is widely used by patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Therefore, it can be inferred that aloe vera can relieve discomfort caused by psoriasis.",NEI
"Does aloe vera help with neurodermatitis, poorly healing or fresh wounds?",Yes,", with caveats

Aloe vera has been traditionally used for the treatment of skin injuries, including burns, cuts, insect bites, and eczemas. Its anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and wound healing properties have been reported in various studies. Animal studies have suggested that aloe vera may help accelerate the wound healing process. However, its mechanisms of action in wound healing are not well understood, and more studies are needed to approve the outcomes. In people with chronic wounds, one trial found no statistically significant difference in pressure ulcer healing with aloe vera, and in a trial of surgical wounds healing by secondary intention, aloe vera significantly delayed healing. Therefore, while aloe vera may have useful effects on wounds, especially cutaneous wounds healing, its effectiveness in treating neurodermatitis, poorly healing or fresh wounds is not fully established and requires further research.",NEI
Does electromagnetic radiation from cell phone towers cause health problems such as headaches or sleep disorders?,NEI,"(Not Enough Information)

    The potential health effects of electromagnetic radiation from cell phone towers on human health remain a topic of ongoing research and debate. While various reports suggest that mobile phone use may be associated with health problems such as fatigue, headache, dizziness, tension, and sleep disturbances, only limited research data is available regarding the interaction between electromagnetic fields emitted by mobile phones and auditory function, as well as the possible impact on hearing. Furthermore, the consequences of long-term exposure to the electromagnetic radiation caused by cell phone towers are still unknown and can potentially be a new health hazard. Therefore, it is not possible to definitively conclude whether electromagnetic radiation from cell phone towers causes health problems such as headaches or sleep disorders based on the available information.",NEI
Can antibiotic-resistant germs from animal husbandry be transferred to humans?,Yes,"Justification: The transfer of antibiotic-resistant germs from animal husbandry to humans is a well-documented phenomenon. This transmission can occur through various routes, including direct contact with animals, environmental spread, and most notably, the food chain. Resistant bacteria and resistance genes in animals can be passed to humans via contaminated food products, potentially leading to the development of resistant infections. The use of antibiotics in animal husbandry selects for drug-resistant microorganisms, which can then be spread from the farm environment to humans. The intensive use of antimicrobials in animals may further promote the fixation of antimicrobial resistance genes in bacteria, which can then be transferred to human-adapted pathogens or human gut microbiota. This issue is a growing concern for both public and animal health.",NEI
Does the use of antibiotics in animal husbandry harm human health?,Yes,"The use of antibiotics in animal husbandry can indeed harm human health. The widespread and often indiscriminate use of antibiotics in livestock agriculture has been linked to the development and spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. This is primarily due to the selection of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in animals, which can then be transferred to humans through the consumption or handling of foods of animal origin. Furthermore, the use of antibiotics in animals can disturb the intestinal microbial community, which plays a fundamental role in animals' health and, by extension, human health. This can lead to various side effects on human health, including adverse consequences from antibiotic residues in food of animal origin. Therefore, the use of antibiotics in animal husbandry poses a significant risk to human health.",Yes
Does regular vitamin D intake lower the risk of cancer in adults?,Yes,", with caveats

Scientific literature supports the hypothesis that regular vitamin D intake may reduce the risk of certain types of cancer in adults. The evidence is particularly strong for colorectal cancer, with numerous studies demonstrating a significant reduction in incidence when vitamin D levels are adequate. This association is observed in studies that consider vitamin D from all sources, as well as those that focus on serum 25(OH)D3 levels.

Additionally, there is some evidence to suggest that vitamin D may play a role in reducing the risk of postmenopausal breast cancer and ovarian cancer. However, the data for other types of cancer, such as lung cancer, is limited and inconclusive.

It is important to note that while vitamin D may have anti-cancer properties, its effects on cancer risk and mortality are complex and not fully understood. Some studies have found that higher circulating levels of vitamin D are associated with a reduced risk of colorectal and bladder cancers, but an increased risk of prostate and possibly pancreatic cancers. Therefore, more research is needed to fully elucidate the role of vitamin D in cancer prevention and treatment.",NEI
Does regular consumption of ground flaxseed harm health?,NEI,"The available data suggests that short-term use of flaxseed in humans does not have deleterious effects on the hemopoietic system, renal and hepatic function, or serum lipids. However, the long-term use of flaxseed in humans has not been extensively studied, and its effects on the hemopoietic system, serum glucose, and renal and kidney function remain unknown. Additionally, while flaxseed has been shown to increase the 17β-estradiol hormone, it is not known if this has any long-term implications with respect to fertility. Furthermore, flaxseed meal may be susceptible to oxidation, which can produce toxic compounds to human health. Therefore, it is not possible to definitively conclude whether regular consumption of ground flaxseed harms health based on the available information.",No
1. can MMR vaccination cause autism?,No,"Justification: The available epidemiological and related evidence does not support a causal association between MMR vaccination and autism. Several studies, including those evaluating high-risk children whose older siblings had autism, have not found an association between MMR vaccination and autism. Although there have been reports of children developing signs of both developmental regression and gastrointestinal symptoms shortly after MMR vaccination, these case reports have not provided convincing scientific evidence to support a causal relationship between the use of MMR vaccines and autism. The hypothesis that MMR vaccines cause autism was first raised by reports of cases in which developmental regression occurred soon after MMR vaccination, but this hypothesis has not been supported by subsequent research. The belief that there is a link between the MMR vaccine and autism has led to a decline in childhood-immunization uptake and a resurgence of preventable infectious diseases. However, the weight of the available evidence does not support this belief.",No
3. does vaccination against rotavirus increase the risk of intestinal intussusception in infants?,No,"The systematic review and meta-analysis, as well as several other studies, suggest that currently available rotavirus vaccines, including monovalent, pentavalent, monovalent human-bovine, oral bovine pentavalent, and human neonatal rotavirus vaccines, were not associated with an elevated risk of intussusception among neonates or infants. Although a small increased risk of intussusception (~1-2 cases per 100,000 vaccinated infants) has been observed in some populations, this is not a consistent finding across all studies. In a case-control study among children <2 years old in Bangladesh, Nepal, Pakistan, and Vietnam, the risk of intussusception was not increased compared with infants who did not receive the rotavirus vaccine. Additionally, among US infants aged 4 to 34 weeks who received the pentavalent rotavirus vaccine (RV5), the risk of intussusception was not increased compared with infants who did not receive the vaccine. Therefore, based on the available evidence, it can be concluded that vaccination against rotavirus does not increase the risk of intestinal intussusception in infants.",NEI
Is ozone suitable for the treatment of tooth decay?,Yes,"Ozone, in both gaseous and aqueous forms, has been suggested as a potential antimicrobial treatment in dentistry due to its antimicrobial, disinfectant, biocompatibility, and healing properties. Its usage has been proposed for the treatment of dental caries, fissure and root caries, and hypersensitive dentin. Ozone's antimicrobial activity is attributed to its ability to oxidize bio-molecules and microbial toxins implicated in periodontal diseases. Furthermore, ozone has been proposed as an alternative antiseptic agent in dentistry, with a number of therapeutic protocols developed to address common dental infections associated with caries. Although ozone treatment of non-cavitated occlusal lesions for 40 seconds failed to significantly reduce the numbers of viable bacteria in infected dentine beneath the demineralized enamel, there is growing interest in the use of ozone in oral healthcare. The National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) is currently reviewing the evidence for its effectiveness in the management of occlusal and plain surface caries.",No
Does the so-called blood group diet have any health benefits?,No,"The scientific literature does not currently support the purported health benefits of blood type diets. While adherence to certain 'blood-type' diets has been associated with favorable effects on some cardiometabolic risk factors, these associations were not dependent on an individual's ABO genotype. This lack of association between blood type and dietary benefits suggests that the 'blood-type' diet hypothesis is not supported by current evidence. Furthermore, no studies have demonstrated that matching 'blood-type' diets with the corresponding blood group changes the effect size of any health outcomes. Therefore, it can be concluded that the so-called blood group diet does not have any proven health benefits.",NEI
"Can pumpkin seeds or preparations from them help women and men with irritable bladder, bladder weakness or incontinence?",Yes,"Evidence suggests that pumpkin seeds or preparations from them can indeed assist individuals, both male and female, dealing with irritable bladder, bladder weakness, or incontinence. Pumpkin seed oil extracts from Cucurbita maxima and Cucurbita pepo have been found to be effective in managing urinary disorders such as overactive bladder (OAB) in humans. Furthermore, the aqueous extract of fluted pumpkin seeds has been shown to significantly scavenge free radicals and inhibit critical enzymes involved in bladder function, such as PDE-5, arginase, AChE, and ACE, in a concentration-dependent pattern. These findings indicate the potential of pumpkin seeds as a functional food ingredient in managing bladder-related disorders.",NEI
"Do products from bees like honey, propolis, royal jelly or bee venom help against cancer?",Yes,"Scientific Explanation:

Research has demonstrated that products from bees, such as honey, propolis, royal jelly, and bee venom, exhibit potential in combating cancer. These natural substances possess potent biological activities that contribute to their medicinal and health-promoting properties. For instance, propolis, a resinous substance produced by honeybees, has been found to have a wide spectrum of biological activities.

In a study, the cytotoxic effects of particular tree-originated honeys from chestnut, cedar, pine, and multifloral honey were investigated on cell lines representing different types of breast cancer. The results indicated that chestnut and cedar honeys were the most cytotoxic on all cell lines, while pine honey was found to be the least toxic on control cells with appropriate toxicity on the cancer cells. Notably, chestnut, cedar, and pine honey displayed a remarkably cytotoxic effect on breast cancer cell lines, including the most aggressive triple negative breast cancer, which lacks targeted anticancer therapy.

Moreover, honey and propolis have been shown to decrease p53 gene expression in certain cell lines, and honey has produced faster healing in patients with grade 2/3 chemotherapy-induced mucositis. Propolis extract has been found to increase the expression of the bcl-2 gene in all cell lines, whereas honey decreased it significantly. By downregulating bcl-2 expression, it could be concluded that the cytotoxicity of honey was more than two-fold against tested cancer cells compared with the sugar solution.

In summary, the evidence suggests that products from bees, including honey, propolis, royal jelly, and bee venom, have potential anti-cancer activities and could potentially be used in therapeutic applications against cancer.",No
Do pumpkin seed preparations improve symptoms caused by a benign enlarged prostate?,Yes,"Evidence suggests that pumpkin seed preparations can improve symptoms caused by benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Studies have shown that pumpkin seed oil can inhibit testosterone-induced hyperplasia of the prostate, which may be beneficial in managing BPH. Pumpkin seeds have been used in traditional medicine for managing erectile dysfunction and treating kidney, bladder, and prostate disorders. Research has indicated that pumpkin seed oil extracts from Cucurbita maxima and Cucurbita pepo are effective for urinary disorders such as overactive bladder in humans. Furthermore, a randomized, double-blind study found that a preparation obtained from pumpkin seeds and dwarf palm plants improved symptoms caused by prostatic hyperplasia. The oil-free hydroethanolic pumpkin seed extract has also been found to be a well-tolerated, appropriate plant extract for supporting health benefits in individuals suffering from BPH-related symptoms without the need for medical treatment.",Yes
"Can gels and ointments containing arnica, hawthorn, cypress, butcher's broom, Asian (or Indian) pennywort, and heparin, such as VaricoFix, relieve discomfort and secondary symptoms of varicose veins?",Yes,"Evidence suggests that topical treatments containing botanical extracts can be beneficial in managing the discomfort and secondary symptoms of varicose veins. The use of aescin, essential phospholipids (EPL), and heparin in the form of a gel has been employed for many years to treat venous and microcirculatory alterations, including varicose veins and chronic venous insufficiency. The efficacy of aescin + EPL (AEPL) gel on microcirculation in subjects with chronic venous insufficiency, venous hypertension, and venous microangiopathy has been evaluated and found to be beneficial.

Furthermore, several botanical extracts have been shown to improve microcirculation, capillary flow, and vascular tone, and to strengthen the connective tissue of the perivascular amorphous substrate. The gel and whole-leaf materials of Aloe vera, A. ferox, and A. marlothii have demonstrated the ability to heal wounds faster and to a larger extent than untreated keratinocytes.

Therefore, it is plausible that gels and ointments containing arnica, hawthorn, cypress, butcher's broom, Asian (or Indian) pennywort, and heparin, such as VaricoFix, could potentially relieve discomfort and secondary symptoms of varicose veins. However, further clinical studies are needed to confirm the effectiveness of these specific ingredients in managing varicose veins.",NEI
Does putting onion bags help with acute otitis media?,NEI,"Justification: The context provided does not contain information regarding the use of onion bags in the treatment or prevention of acute otitis media. Onion (Allium cepa) is mentioned as an immune-boosting food rich in fructans. However, there is no scientific evidence or recommendation in the context to suggest that placing onion bags near the ear or using them in any form would help with acute otitis media. Therefore, based on the given context, there is not enough information to support the claim that putting onion bags helps with acute otitis media.",NEI
Can serious problems occur after stopping antidepressants?,Yes,"Justification: Although adverse discontinuation effects can occur with all types of antidepressant drugs, they are rarely considered serious. However, rapid discontinuation of some psychotropic medications is followed by discontinuation symptoms as well as an increased risk of early illness recurrence. Serotonergic antidepressant drugs are sometimes associated with a distinct discontinuation syndrome characterized by dizziness, weakness, nausea, headache, lethargy, insomnia, anxiety, poor concentration, and paresthesias. Furthermore, our findings raise the possibility that, in the long-term, antidepressants may impair recovery and increase the risk of rehospitalisation in patients with both primarily affective and non-affective disorders. Therefore, serious problems can occur after stopping antidepressants.",NEI
Does self urine help with health problems?,Yes,", with caveats.

The use of self-urine for health benefits is a topic that requires careful consideration and scientific evaluation. While urine is primarily a waste product, it contains various constituents that may have functional roles in health and disease. For instance, urine-based biomarkers have been identified as potential diagnostic and prognostic tools for bladder diseases, including bladder cancer and other benign dysfunctions. However, it is important to note that urine can also be a vehicle for agents with potential or occult bioactivity, which could contribute to symptoms through interaction with the urothelium. Therefore, the use of self-urine for health benefits should be approached with caution and under the guidance of healthcare professionals.",NEI
Do unsaturated fats (from plants and fish) reduce cardiovascular disease compared to saturated fats (from meat and dairy products)?,Yes,"Evidence suggests that diets high in unsaturated fatty acids, particularly polyunsaturated fats, are associated with lower blood cholesterol concentrations and reduced atherosclerosis compared to diets high in saturated fat. Omega-3 unsaturated fatty acids, found in fish and fish oils, have been strongly linked to lower rates of cardiovascular disease in epidemiologic studies. Diets enriched with omega-3 fatty acids have been shown to decrease the incidence of coronary heart disease and atherosclerotic vascular disease. Incorporating walnuts and fatty fish into a healthy diet has been shown to lower serum cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations, respectively, which can favorably affect the risk of coronary heart disease. Dietary fats play a critical role in atherogenesis and thrombosis, and unsaturated fats have cholesterol-lowering, antiatherogenic, and antiarrhythmic properties that decrease the risk of myocardial infarction.",NEI
Is a vegetarian diet including eggs and dairy products healthier than a diet that includes meat?,Yes,"A vegetarian diet that includes eggs and dairy products, known as a lacto-ovo-vegetarian diet, is generally considered healthier than a diet that includes meat. This diet offers distinct advantages due to its higher content of fiber, folic acid, vitamins C and E, potassium, magnesium, and many phytochemicals, as well as a fat content that is more unsaturated. Lacto-ovo-vegetarian diets are typically lower in energy, saturated fatty acids, and animal protein compared to omnivorous diets. The consumption of plant proteins rather than animal proteins in this diet may contribute to a reduced risk of chronic diseases such as diabetes and heart disease. However, it is essential to note that a well-planned lacto-ovo-vegetarian diet should include fortified foods to ensure adequate nutrient intake and prevent potential deficiencies.",NEI
Can washing hands with antibacterial soaps or wash lotions containing triclosan or triclocarban prevent the risk of contracting diseases in the household?,NEI,"(Not Enough Information)

Evidence from a double-blinded, randomized clinical trial suggests that the use of antibacterial soaps containing triclosan did not significantly increase antimicrobial drug resistance after one year. However, this study does not provide conclusive evidence that antibacterial soaps prevent the risk of contracting diseases in the household. It is important to note that hand washing with regular soap and water is recognized as a major barrier to the spread of disease. Furthermore, the study indicates that both triclosan and triclocarban have a risk of bacterial resistance, which is higher for chlorhexidine than triclosan. Therefore, it is not conclusive that washing hands with antibacterial soaps or wash lotions containing triclosan or triclocarban can prevent the risk of contracting diseases in the household.",NEI
Can hand washing with antibacterial soaps or wash lotions containing other disinfectants reduce the risk of infection compared to regular soap???,Yes,"Evidence suggests that hand washing with antibacterial soaps or wash lotions containing other disinfectants can reduce the risk of infection compared to regular soap. Antibacterial lotions, when used in conjunction with thorough hand washing, have been shown to provide a demonstrable reduction in bacterial levels on the skin. Studies have also indicated that antiseptic hand washing and the use of nonsterile gloves over unwashed hands confer similar reductions in the number of microorganisms. Furthermore, a review of experimental studies comparing the effects of hand washing with plain soap and water to antimicrobial soap and waterless hand sanitizer on health and hand contamination in naturalistic conditions found that antimicrobial soap was more effective than plain soap and water in reducing hand contamination. However, it is important to note that hand washing with plain soap and water is still an effective method for reducing the presence of bacteria and preventing the spread of infections. Additionally, the use of antimicrobial hand towels did not prevent E. coli contamination of mothers' hands in Kenyan households during random testing and offered no advantages over standard handwashing and drying practices. Therefore, while antibacterial soaps and wash lotions containing other disinfectants can be beneficial in reducing the risk of infection, they should not be considered a substitute for thorough hand washing and good hygienic practices.",Yes
Does homeopathy work better than a placebo?,NEI,"The effectiveness of homeopathy in comparison to placebo remains a subject of ongoing debate, with mixed results observed in various studies. While some research suggests that homeopathic remedies may have greater efficacy than placebo in certain conditions, such as premenstrual syndrome/dysphoric disorder, other studies have found no significant difference between homeopathy and placebo in conditions like major depressive disorder and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Furthermore, the complex of homeopathy tested in a specific study was not superior to placebo in reducing 24-hour morphine consumption after knee ligament reconstruction. Given these inconsistent findings, it is not possible to definitively conclude that homeopathy works better than a placebo. Therefore, more research is needed to establish the effectiveness of homeopathy beyond a placebo response.",NEI
Does toothpaste containing xylitol reduce the risk of caries?,NEI,"The context provided does not explicitly mention the use of xylitol in toothpaste. However, it does indicate that xylitol has been shown to reduce dental caries when mixed with food or chewing gum, and that it is a well-known anticaries agent. Xylitol is known to reduce caries by inhibiting the growth of Streptococcus mutans, a bacteria that contributes to the development of dental caries. The context also suggests that habitual xylitol gum-chewing may have a long-term preventive effect on caries risk. Therefore, it is plausible that toothpaste containing xylitol could also have a caries-preventive effect. However, without specific studies investigating the use of xylitol in toothpaste, it is not possible to definitively conclude that toothpaste containing xylitol reduces the risk of caries.",NEI
"Do other xylitol-containing products (e.g. chewing gums, sweets, mouth rinses) reduce the risk of caries in addition to normal dental care?",Yes,"Evidence suggests that xylitol, a sugar alcohol, has potential as a caries preventive agent. While the context primarily discusses xylitol-containing chewing gum, it also mentions that xylitol can be incorporated into chewing gum or confections used habitually. This implies that other xylitol-containing products, such as sweets, could also reduce the risk of caries. The context also states that substituting sucrose with xylitol in chewing gums and sweets has a beneficial effect. Furthermore, the context mentions a new trial where children of mothers who used xylitol lozenges had less dental caries than a comparison group. This suggests that xylitol-containing mouth rinses or lozenges could also reduce the risk of caries. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that other xylitol-containing products may reduce the risk of caries in addition to normal dental care.",Yes
Are paper towels or electric dryers more hygienic after washing hands?,Yes,"From a hygiene perspective, paper towels are generally considered more superior to electric air dryers. Studies suggest that paper towels can efficiently dry hands, effectively remove bacteria, and cause less environmental contamination. The use of jet air dryers has been demonstrated as an effective method to eliminate bacteria on hands, but paper towels are still widely accepted as the most hygienic means of drying hands. The log reduction of bacteria on fingertips is often greater with paper towels than with warm air. Furthermore, no significant difference in bacteria reduction was detected between the use of one or two paper towels for hand drying. Therefore, using fewer resources is recommended to maintain environmental sustainability. In locations where hygiene is paramount, such as hospitals and clinics, paper towels should be recommended.",No
"Are soy foods risky for people with unremarkable, or subclinical, hypothyroidism?",Inconclusive,"The impact of soy consumption on thyroid function in individuals with subclinical hypothyroidism remains uncertain. While some studies suggest that soy phytoestrogens may increase the risk of developing overt hypothyroidism, a pharmacological dose of 66 mg of soy phytoestrogens did not significantly alter thyroid function tests in patients with subclinical hypothyroidism. Concerns persist regarding the potential adverse effects of soy on thyroid function, as soy consumption has been associated with thyroid disorders such as hypothyroidism, goiter, and autoimmune thyroid disease. However, the clinical significance of these associations remains unclear. Soy protein with isoflavones appears to have an adverse effect on thyroid function, but it is not known whether it is the protein or isoflavone component that is detrimental. In women, high consumption of soy protein was associated with elevated TSH concentrations. Nonetheless, further research is needed to fully understand the relationship between soy consumption and thyroid function in individuals with subclinical hypothyroidism.",Yes
Does taking vitamin B3 prolong life?,NEI,"The context provided does not offer sufficient information to definitively answer whether vitamin B3 (niacin) prolongs life. While the text discusses the involvement of vitamin B3 in maintaining homeostasis and its potential role in protecting against cognitive decline, it does not provide conclusive evidence regarding its impact on longevity. Further research is needed to establish a direct link between vitamin B3 supplementation and increased lifespan.",NEI
"Can taking Ribose help with heart conditions such as heart failure, narrowing of the coronary arteries (coronary artery disease), or heart attack?",Yes,"Ribose, a pentose monosaccharide, has demonstrated efficacy in improving cardiac energy metabolism and function following ischemia in animal models. Clinical trials have shown that ribose supplementation improves ischemic threshold and enhances diastolic function in congestive heart failure. It has been used successfully in the treatment of ischemic heart disease and muscular enzyme deficiencies. In patients with coronary artery disease and chronic heart failure, ribose improved diastolic functional parameters and enhanced quality of life. Ribose pretreatment significantly elevated the heart's energy stores and delayed the onset of irreversible ischemic injury in normal hearts. In hypertrophied hearts, ribose improved ventricular function despite no change in hemodynamics. Ribose has also been shown to replenish low myocardial energy levels and improve ventilation efficiency in patients with heart failure. These findings suggest that ribose may be beneficial in managing heart conditions such as heart failure, narrowing of the coronary arteries (coronary artery disease), or heart attack.",No
Are vitamins and minerals effective and safe in lowering cholesterol?,Yes,"Scientific studies have established that various vitamins and nutritional supplements can contribute to a reduction in total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. These include dietary phytosterols, which have been shown to lower total and LDL cholesterol, and high doses of phytosterols that can significantly reduce blood cholesterol levels. Additionally, soluble fibers and legume proteins are known to be safe and practical approaches for cholesterol reduction. Certain dietary practices, such as the consumption of vegetable-containing diets, have been associated with lower total cholesterol concentrations compared to control diets. Cholesterol-lowering nutraceuticals and hypolipidemic nutraceuticals are useful in managing moderate hypercholesterolemia and improving serum lipid profiles, respectively. Furthermore, dietary supplementation with B-vitamins that lower plasma total homocysteine concentrations is expected to lower the risk of cardiovascular disease. Therefore, it can be concluded that vitamins and minerals are effective and safe in lowering cholesterol.",NEI
Is fasting effective and safe in the long term for arthritis and other diseases?,Yes,"Evidence suggests that fasting can be effective and safe in the long term for arthritis and other diseases. Prolonged fasting for 7 to 10 days has been shown to significantly improve clinical symptoms in otherwise healthy and well-nourished patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Fasting has also been found to reduce joint pain, swelling, and morning stiffness in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Additionally, fasting followed by vegetarian diets may help patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Fasting regimens have been shown to promote health, mitigate chronic immunological disorders, and improve age-related pathophysiological parameters in animals and humans. Previous studies have demonstrated that fasting produces a potential effect in the prevention and treatment of many diseases. Intermittent fasting has been found to be effective in reducing metabolic disorders and age-related diseases. Fasting has also been recommended as a therapeutic intervention for the management of several chronic, non-infectious diseases. Fasting has been shown to have a beneficial modulating effect on blood lipids and glucose regulation, as well as improve overall well-being. Although the anti-inflammatory effect of short-term fasting is of little therapeutic value, it is of significant interest and better understanding of the mechanisms is desirable. Routine, periodic fasting has been associated with a lower prevalence of coronary artery disease.",Yes
Do green smoothies promote health?,Yes,"Justification: The consumption of green smoothies, which are rich in health-promoting compounds, has been shown to have positive associations with human health. These associations are primarily due to the high concentration of fruits and vegetables in green smoothies, which provide essential vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. Furthermore, the greenness of these smoothies, derived from ingredients such as cucumber, broccoli, and spinach, may positively influence health by promoting physical activity and social contact, decreasing stress, and mitigating exposure to air pollution, noise, and heat. While the findings are not conclusive, there is mounting evidence that exposure to green environments, including the consumption of green smoothies, is associated with various health benefits, such as improved mental health, lower mortality rates, and increased participation in leisure-time physical activity.",No
Does chocolate have a mood-lifting effect?,Yes,"Chocolate has been shown to have a mood-lifting effect, particularly in improving negative mood states. This effect is attributed to the palatability of chocolate, as demonstrated in studies where participants experienced mood improvement after consuming palatable chocolate compared to unpalatable chocolate or nothing. The mood-altering properties of chocolate are thought to be due to its interactions with neurotransmitters, which contribute to mood modulation and appetite regulation. However, it is important to note that the relationship between chocolate and mood is complex, involving psychopharmacological components, nutritional and sensory characteristics of the food. Furthermore, the effect of chocolate on mood is more pronounced when consumed mindfully, compared to non-mindful consumption or consumption of other foods such as crackers.",NEI
Do sprouts or buds have a healing effect?,Yes,"Sprouts and buds, particularly those derived from plants, have demonstrated potential healing effects due to their regenerative capacities and the bioactive compounds they contain. Plants possess a natural ability to regenerate after wounding, with sprouting becoming apparent within 5-7 days and reaching maximal values by 14-21 days. This regeneration process is facilitated by the nanostructure of plant extracts and their phytochemicals, which enhance bioavailability and control their release to the wound site. The permeability of these therapeutics to underlying skin layers is also improved, contributing to the healing process. Furthermore, plant-based nanomaterials have been shown to target various pharmacological pathways involved in wound healing, such as suppressing inflammatory cytokines, reducing oxidative factors, and promoting neovascularization. Therefore, it can be concluded that sprouts and buds have a healing effect, and their potential as future pharmaceutical drugs is promising.",No
Is belly fat or is a large abdominal girth particularly dangerous for health?,Yes,"Abdominal fat, often referred to as belly fat or a large abdominal girth, is particularly dangerous for health. This is due to its strong association with cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, as well as certain types of cancer. Abdominal obesity, or central obesity, is considered more harmful than overall obesity because of its link to insulin resistance and increased cardiovascular risk. The presence of excess fat in the abdominal area, specifically visceral fat, is considered the most unhealthful form of adiposity. It contributes to various metabolic disorders, including metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases. Furthermore, a high ratio of waist to hip circumference, indicative of abdominal overfat, has been associated with a high proportion of intra-abdominal fat. Therefore, it is accurate to say that belly fat or a large abdominal girth poses significant health risks.",NEI
"Can choline ingested with food - alone or in the form of lecithin, for example - improve memory?",NEI,"The potential for choline ingested with food to improve memory is inconclusive. While animal studies suggest that choline supplementation can enhance memory and learning, human studies have not yielded consistent results. In particular, two double-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over experiments found no significant improvement in declarative or working memory in healthy, young students after choline supplementation. However, it is important to note that the effects of choline on memory may depend on various factors, such as dosage, timing, and individual differences in choline metabolism. Additionally, prenatal choline supplementation has been shown to enhance working memory and hippocampal long-term potentiation in adult offspring, suggesting that the benefits of choline may be more pronounced during critical periods of brain development. Further research is needed to elucidate the potential cognitive benefits of choline supplementation in humans.",NEI
Does white sugar cause cancer?,NEI,"(Not Enough Information)

Current scientific evidence suggests that high sugar consumption may be associated with an increased risk of certain cancers, such as colorectal cancer, through mechanisms involving insulin-glucose dysregulation, oxidative stress, hormonal imbalances, and excess adiposity. However, the evidence is not conclusive, and more research is needed to establish a definitive causal relationship between sugar intake and cancer risk. It is important to note that the context does not specifically address the impact of white sugar on cancer risk. Therefore, based on the available information, it is not possible to definitively conclude that white sugar causes cancer.",Yes
Do wound care products with sodium hypochlorite such as ActiMaris promote the healing process of wounds?,Yes,"Wound care products containing sodium hypochlorite, such as ActiMaris, have been shown to promote the healing process of wounds. Sodium hypochlorite solutions have demonstrated efficacy in topically decontaminating intact skin, with hypochlorous acid possessing both anti-microbial and wound healing properties. The use of sodium hypochlorite in wound care products can contribute to a moist healing environment, which is beneficial for wound healing. Furthermore, in comparison to saline-treated wounds, those treated with sodium hypochlorite have shown reduced wound area, indicating accelerated healing. However, it is important to note that further research is needed to fully understand the efficacy of sodium hypochlorite in promoting wound healing, particularly in chemically contaminated wounds.",NEI
Does the dietary supplement MSM help with osteoarthritis?,Yes,"Methylsulfonylmethane (MSM) has been demonstrated to improve pain and physical function in patients with knee osteoarthritis when used as an oral supplement for 12 weeks. MSM is an organic sulfur-containing compound that has been widely used as a dietary supplement for its beneficial effects against various diseases, particularly arthritis. Its anti-inflammatory and antioxidative properties contribute to its potential in managing osteoarthritis. Furthermore, MSM has been shown to reduce oxidative stress and inflammation, as well as exhibit apoptotic or anti-apoptotic effects depending on the cell type or activating stimuli. While the benefits and safety of MSM in managing osteoarthritis and long-term use cannot be confirmed from a single pilot trial, its potential clinical application has been examined.",NEI
"Is wheat lectin, which is found in high amounts especially in whole wheat, harmful to health?",NEI,"(Not Enough Information)

While the context discusses various health implications of wheat consumption, it does not provide specific information regarding wheat lectin, which is a distinct component of wheat. Lectins are proteins that can bind to carbohydrates, and they are found in many plant-based foods, including wheat. However, the context does not mention the effects of wheat lectin on human health. Therefore, based on the given context, it is not possible to definitively state whether wheat lectin is harmful to health. Further research or information would be needed to provide a conclusive answer.",NEI
Is it harmful to health to regularly eat large quantities of fish contaminated with dioxins and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs)?,Yes,"Justification: Regular consumption of large quantities of fish contaminated with dioxins and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) can be harmful to human health. Dioxins and PCBs are highly toxic organochlorine compounds that can accumulate in fish and shellfish, particularly those from contaminated waters. These compounds can bioaccumulate in the aquatic food web, leading to higher levels in fish with higher fat content. Human exposure to these pollutants primarily occurs through ingestion of contaminated fish and fishery products. The human population is exposed to dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs mainly through diet, with fish and fishery products being important vectors. Long-term exposure to these compounds can have adverse health effects, including cancer, reproductive and developmental problems, and immune system dysfunction. Therefore, it is important to understand the uptake, biotransformation, and elimination of PCBs in fish and to monitor the levels of these pollutants in fish and fishery products to ensure their safety for human consumption.",NEI
Is the DMPS test suitable to reliably indicate mercury poisoning?,No,"The DMPS test, while useful in mobilizing mercury from the body and decreasing urinary mercury concentration to normal levels, is not a reliable diagnostic indicator of mercury poisoning. A simple rise in chelated mercury excretion over baseline excretion is not a reliable diagnostic indicator of mercury poisoning. The gold standards for diagnosis of mercury poisoning, including low-level chronic mercury exposure, are 24-hour urine for mercury and blood mercury. Therefore, the DMPS test is not suitable to reliably indicate mercury poisoning.",Yes
Can stevia lower high blood pressure?,Yes,"Stevia has been shown to have potential antihypertensive effects. In various human and animal models, stevia has demonstrated beneficial modulatory effects on cardiovascular tissues. Stevia's mechanism of action includes calcium channel antagonism and activation of the m2 muscarinic receptor function, which contribute to its ability to lower blood pressure. The study found that stevia caused relaxation of aortic tissues, which was significantly potentiated in the presence of verapamil, a known calcium channel blocker. Furthermore, stevia's effects on blood pressure were not fully dependent on nitric oxide-dependent pathways, as shown by the lack of blockage by l-NAME in mesenteric arteries. These findings suggest that stevia may have a role in reducing high blood pressure through its effects on cardiovascular tissues. However, further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms and optimal use of stevia for this purpose.",NEI
Is eating genetically modified corn a health concern?,NEI,"The scientific evidence regarding the health effects of consuming genetically modified corn remains inconclusive. While some studies have indicated that genetically modified corn may not pose significant immunotoxic or clinical risks, other studies have raised concerns about the potential impact on the gut microbiota and nutrient digestibility. Furthermore, the long-term effects of consuming genetically modified corn, particularly in humans, are not well understood. The use of genetically modified corn as a host for vaccine production and the potential for contamination with mycotoxins also add to the complexity of this issue. Therefore, it is not possible to definitively state whether or not eating genetically modified corn is a health concern based on the available evidence.",No
Are privately performed IgG tests to clarify food intolerances meaningful?,No,"The clinical utility of specific IgG4 dosing against food in adult patients with suspected food allergy/intolerance has been evaluated, and it has been found that testing for specific IgG4 lacks clinical utility for the diagnosis of food allergy or intolerance. Food-specific IgG4 does not indicate food allergy or intolerance, but rather a physiological response of the immune system after exposure to food components. Testing of IgG4 to foods is considered irrelevant for the laboratory work-up of food allergy or intolerance and should not be performed in case of food-related complaints. These findings, combined with the lack of convincing evidence for histamine-releasing properties of IgG4 in humans, and lack of any controlled studies on the diagnostic value of IgG4 testing in food allergy, do not provide any basis for the hypothesis that food-specific IgG4 should be attributed with an effector role in food hypersensitivity.",No
Is a gluten-free diet recommended for people who do not have celiac disease?,No,"Justification: While a gluten-free diet is the safest and most effective treatment for individuals with celiac disease and other gluten-related disorders, there is minimal evidence to suggest that it is beneficial for individuals without these conditions. Despite the increasing popularity of the gluten-free diet among health-conscious individuals, it is not recommended for those without celiac disease or non-celiac gluten sensitivity. In fact, adherence to a gluten-free diet without a medical indication may result in poorer self-reported health and a higher prevalence of blood and immune disorders and digestive conditions. Therefore, it is not recommended for individuals without celiac disease to follow a gluten-free diet.",No
Does the plant substance nobiletin contained in mandarins protect against weight gain?,NEI,"The context provided does not explicitly mention the direct effect of nobiletin on weight gain. However, it does discuss the protective effects of nobiletin against various metabolic dysfunctions, including nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), hyperlipidemia, insulin resistance, and adiposity. These conditions are often associated with weight gain and obesity. Furthermore, the context mentions that naringenin, another citrus flavonoid, prevents diet-induced weight gain in rodents. As nobiletin and naringenin share similar properties, it is plausible that nobiletin may also have weight-protective effects. However, without explicit evidence, it cannot be definitively stated that nobiletin protects against weight gain. Therefore, the label is NEI (Not Enough Information).",Yes
Does consumption of dairy products in middle and advanced age protect against bone fractures?,Yes,"The scientific literature suggests a positive association between dairy product consumption and bone health in middle-aged and older adults. Studies have shown that higher milk and dairy food intake is associated with a lower risk of hip fracture in older adults, potentially through mechanisms related to bone mineral density. Furthermore, greater intakes of milk and yogurt have been linked to a reduced risk of hip fracture, partially due to their beneficial effects on bone health. Dairy foods are rich in bone-beneficial nutrients, such as calcium, vitamin D, and protein, which contribute to maintaining bone health and reducing the risk of fractures. However, it is important to note that the role of dairy foods in hip fracture prevention remains controversial, and more research is needed to fully understand the underlying mechanisms and optimal intake levels for bone health.",NEI
Is the milk of horn-bearing cows less rich in allergens and more easily tolerated by lactose-intolerant individuals?,NEI,"The provided context does not contain specific information regarding the milk of horn-bearing cows and its allergen content or tolerance by lactose-intolerant individuals. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer based solely on the given context. Further research and evidence are needed to determine whether the milk of horn-bearing cows is less rich in allergens and more easily tolerated by lactose-intolerant individuals.",Yes
"Does daily flossing protect against tooth decay, periodontitis and tooth loss?",NEI,"(Not Enough Information)

Evidence suggests that daily flossing, in conjunction with toothbrushing, may be associated with a small reduction in plaque at 1 and 3 months. However, the evidence is weak and unreliable, based on ten studies. The use of dental floss has long been considered effective in controlling interproximal plaque and gingivitis, but the data for the outcomes of caries, calculus, clinical attachment loss, or quality of life is not reported in the included trials. Therefore, it is not possible to definitively conclude that daily flossing protects against tooth decay, periodontitis, and tooth loss.",NEI
Do protein supplements help build muscle?,Yes,"Protein supplements have been shown to enhance muscle protein synthesis after exercise, which is a critical process for maintaining or increasing muscle mass when combined with training. The provision of dietary amino acids, which are the building blocks of proteins, increases skeletal muscle protein synthesis, an effect that is further enhanced by prior resistance exercise. Consuming protein following exercise has been shown to stimulate protein synthesis acutely in skeletal muscle, supporting muscle repair, growth, and remodeling. Protein supplementation during resistance training has a modest effect on whole-body lean mass compared to exercise training without protein supplementation. It is generally accepted that protein supplementation is required to maximize the adaptive response of the skeletal muscle to prolonged resistance-type exercise training. Therefore, protein supplements can help build muscle when combined with regular exercise.",No
Does music therapy promote recovery from severe limitations of consciousness after severe brain injury?,Yes,"Evidence suggests that music therapy can indeed promote recovery from severe limitations of consciousness after severe brain injury. Music-based therapy has been shown to induce neuromodulation at the brain level and improve functional recovery. It has been used in the early rehabilitation of patients with disorders of consciousness, such as coma, unresponsive wakefulness syndrome, and minimally conscious state. Music therapy stimulates brain functions involved in movement, cognition, speech, emotions, and sensory perceptions. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated to enhance cognitive functioning and neuroplasticity. Neurosensory stimulation, including music listening, has been found to be effective in enhancing the recovery process of severely brain-injured patients with disorders of consciousness. The beneficial effects of music on cognitive processes have been observed in both normal and pathological cerebral functioning.",Yes
Can eating grapefruit in combination with some medications lead to harmful interactions?,Yes,"Consumption of grapefruit or its juice in combination with certain medications can indeed lead to harmful interactions. This occurs due to the presence of furanocoumarins in grapefruit, which are known to strongly interact with a variety of medications. One of the most prominent food-drug interactions is the inhibition of intestinal cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A enzymes by grapefruit juice ingredients. As many drugs are metabolized via CYP3A, this interaction can be of clinical importance. Drugs that interact with grapefruit and induce serious clinical consequences include immunosuppressants, some statins, benzodiazepines, most calcium channel blockers, indinavir, and carbamazepine. It is important to note that the variable composition of grapefruit juice makes it difficult to predict the magnitude and clinical consequences of drug interactions in a given patient. Therefore, caution should be exercised when consuming grapefruit or its juice in combination with drugs, especially those with a narrow therapeutic margin or a risk of serious dose-dependent adverse effects.",Yes
Can regular consumption of chocolate prevent cardiovascular disease?,Yes,", with caveats.

Previous epidemiological studies have suggested that regular consumption of chocolate may have potential preventive effects on cardiovascular disease (CVD). Chocolate, particularly dark chocolate, is rich in antioxidant flavonoids and stearic acid, which have been associated with improved endothelial function, lower blood pressure, and reduced inflammation. Observational studies have linked chocolate consumption with reduced cardiovascular mortality, and meta-analyses of prospective studies have found an inverse relationship between chocolate intake and the risk of coronary heart disease, stroke, and diabetes. However, it is important to note that while these findings are promising, the relationship between chocolate consumption and CVD risk is complex and influenced by various factors such as the type and amount of chocolate consumed, as well as individual genetic and lifestyle factors. Additionally, excessive consumption of chocolate can lead to weight gain and other negative health consequences. Therefore, while regular consumption of chocolate may have potential cardiovascular benefits, it should be consumed in moderation and as part of a balanced diet.",NEI
Is barley grass good for health?,Yes,"Justification: Barley grass (Hordeum vulgare L.) is a nutrient-rich cereal crop that has been cultivated for centuries. It is known to contain various bioactive compounds, including β-glucan and anthocyanins, which have been shown to possess antioxidant properties and potential health benefits. Research has demonstrated that barley grass juice exhibits potent in vitro antioxidant activity and may have antiobesity effects. Furthermore, administration of barley grass juice has been reported to decrease bodyweight, improve lipid profile, and enhance liver function markers. Additionally, young barley grass has been suggested to have cancer chemopreventive potential in colon carcinoma. Therefore, it can be concluded that barley grass is good for health and may be an effective nutraceutical in promoting human health.",Yes
Are diets with reduced carbohydrate content better for weight loss than other weight loss programs?,Yes,"Evidence from randomized controlled trials indicates that low-carbohydrate diets may facilitate short-term weight loss by reducing energy intake. These diets have been shown to result in significantly greater weight loss compared to low-fat diets (δ = -2.0 kg, 95% CI: -3.1, -0.9). Additionally, low-carbohydrate diets have been associated with a significantly lower predicted risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease events (p<0.03) compared to low-fat diets. However, long-term clinical safety and efficacy of low-carbohydrate diets have not been studied. Nonetheless, low-carbohydrate diets are a popular weight-loss strategy and have been advocated as an effective method for promoting weight loss in overweight and obese individuals and preventing and treating type 2 diabetes.",Yes
Does taking probiotics during pregnancy and early life protect children from atopic dermatitis?,Yes,"Evidence from a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials indicates that probiotic use during pregnancy and early life decreases the incidence of atopic dermatitis in infants and young children. Maternal probiotic supplementation has been shown to prevent the development of atopic dermatitis in offspring, and certain probiotic strains have reduced the risk of atopic eczema in high-risk infants. Additionally, probiotic supplementation has been associated with a reduced relative risk of atopic eczema at 6 months and of rhinoconjunctivitis between 18 and 36 months in children. The results of the meta-analysis suggest that probiotic use during pregnancy and early infancy may have a moderate role in preventing atopic diseases, including atopic dermatitis and IgE-associated atopic dermatitis.",NEI

While the context discusses various health benefits associated with apple consumption, such as reduced risk of chronic diseases like cancer and cardiovascular disease, it does not mention any direct or indirect link between apple consumption and smoking cessation. Therefore, based on the given context, it is not possible to conclude that apples help with smoking cessation. Further research is needed to establish a connection between the two.",Yes
Do products made from fenugreek seeds help you lose weight?,Yes,"The repeated administration of a fenugreek seed extract has been shown to significantly decrease daily fat consumption in healthy overweight subjects, as evidenced by a reduction of 17.3% compared to a placebo group. This decrease in fat consumption was observed even when total energy expenditure was taken into account. Additionally, the study revealed a significant decrease in the insulin/glucose ratio in subjects treated with fenugreek seed extract, suggesting an improvement in glucose metabolism. Given that excessive fat consumption and impaired glucose metabolism are both associated with weight gain, these findings suggest that products made from fenugreek seeds may aid in weight loss. However, it is important to note that further research is needed to confirm these effects and determine the optimal dosage and duration of treatment.",Yes
Does skipping breakfast increase heart attack risk?,Yes,"Evidence from epidemiological studies and meta-analyses suggests that skipping breakfast is associated with an increased risk of heart disease. This association is independent of the presence of traditional and dietary cardiovascular risk factors. The primary meta-analysis demonstrated that people who regularly skipped breakfast were 21% more likely to experience incident cardiovascular disease or die from it than people who regularly consumed breakfast. Additionally, skipping breakfast has been linked to an increased prevalence of noncoronary and generalized atherosclerosis, as well as cardiometabolic risk factors such as obesity, high blood pressure, unfavorable lipid profiles, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome. The up-regulation of appetite due to breakfast skipping may lead to weight gain over time and deleterious changes in risk factors for diabetes and cardiovascular disease.",Yes
Does wheat make you fat and sick?,NEI,"Justification: The claim that wheat consumption leads to obesity and sickness is not fully supported by available scientific evidence. While it is true that wheat-related disorders such as food allergy to wheat (FAW) and celiac disease are increasing in prevalence, these conditions only affect a small portion of the population. Furthermore, wheat is an important source of nutrients such as protein, B vitamins, minerals, and bioactive components, which are essential for maintaining good health.

However, it is also important to note that the ingestion of wheat and other cereals has been linked to several gut disorders, including bloating, abdominal pain, and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Additionally, wheat gluten proteins have been identified as a cause of adverse reactions, including allergies and non-celiac gluten sensitivity.

Therefore, while wheat consumption is generally safe and healthy for the vast majority of people, individuals with wheat-related disorders may experience adverse health effects. More research is needed to fully understand the potential risks and benefits of wheat consumption, particularly in relation to cardiovascular risk and nutritional deficiencies.",No
Do whole grains lower the likelihood of dying early?,Yes,"Evidence from epidemiological studies has consistently shown that whole grain intake is associated with a lower risk of several lifestyle-related diseases, including cardiovascular diseases (CVD), type 2 diabetes, and certain types of cancers. This association is thought to be due to the plethora of nutrients and protective chemicals found in whole grains, which may have synergistic actions in promoting health. In particular, higher intakes of whole grains have been associated with reduced all-cause and CVD-specific mortality in both men and women with diabetes mellitus, independent of other risk factors such as age, body mass index, smoking, alcohol intake, physical activity, and history of hypertension or high cholesterol. These findings suggest that whole grain intake may have a potential benefit in reducing mortality and cardiovascular risk in diabetic patients.",NEI
"Does the consumption of dairy products promote mucus and diseases of the ear, nose and throat?",No,"The scientific evidence does not support the claim that dairy product consumption promotes mucus production and diseases of the ear, nose, and throat. A single exposure to cow's milk is not associated with respiratory symptoms, bronchial inflammation, or bronchial constriction in both non-asthmatic and asthmatic children. Furthermore, there is no consistent evidence to support the premise that dairy product consumption is associated with the risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or asthma development. In fact, the totality of available scientific evidence supports that intake of milk and dairy products may protect against the most prevalent chronic diseases, whereas very few adverse effects have been reported. Therefore, it is not recommended to eliminate dairy products from a child's diet for the prevention of respiratory symptoms.",Yes
Does regular consumption of energy drinks harm heart health?,Yes,"Regular consumption of energy drinks has been shown to have adverse effects on cardiovascular health. Studies have indicated that energy drink consumption can lead to an increase in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, as well as heart rate. Furthermore, energy drink consumption has been linked to platelet aggregation and decreased endothelial function, both of which are associated with an increased risk of myocardial infarction. While more research is needed to fully understand the long-term effects of energy drink consumption on heart health, the available evidence suggests that regular consumption of energy drinks may have negative consequences for cardiovascular health.",Yes
Do light drinks promote obesity?,Yes,"Evidence suggests that the consumption of low-calorie beverages can paradoxically promote weight gain and obesity. This is attributed to the presence of artificial sweeteners, which may induce appetite increase due to an ambiguous psychobiological signal. This signal uncouples sweet taste from calorie intake, thereby confusing the appetite's regulatory mechanisms and promoting overeating. Furthermore, the consumption of low-calorie beverages reduces calories from the drink itself, but compensatory phenomena may increase overall energy intake, which must be recognized and avoided. These findings are supported by epidemiological studies linking higher consumption of low-calorie beverages with increased body weight gain.",NEI
Does coffee reduce the risk of dementia?,Yes,"Numerous epidemiological studies have indicated that coffee consumption may be associated with a lower risk of developing dementia and other neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). The findings suggest that higher lifetime coffee intake may contribute to reducing the risk of AD or related cognitive decline by decreasing pathological cerebral amyloid deposition. Coffee and its components have several neuroprotective properties that lower the risk of cognitive decline and other neurodegenerative diseases. In particular, coffee polyphenols have been shown to prevent cognitive deficits and reduce amyloid β (Aβ) plaque deposition via disaggregation of Aβ in animal models. While the mechanism by which coffee may provide neuroprotection in humans is not fully understood, accumulating evidence suggests that coffee consumption may reduce the risk for type 2 diabetes, a known risk factor for AD and other neurological diseases. Therefore, based on the available evidence, it can be concluded that coffee consumption may reduce the risk of dementia.",Yes
Does sugar consumption increase the risk of developing type 2 diabetes regardless of obesity?,Yes,"Scientific Explanation: Observational and experimental studies have demonstrated an association between sugar consumption and the development of type 2 diabetes, independent of obesity. The findings indicate that duration and degree of sugar exposure correlate significantly with diabetes prevalence in a dose-dependent manner. Controlling for other factors, such as total calories, overweight, obesity, and socioeconomic variables, a 150 kcal/person/day increase in sugar availability is associated with a 1.1% increase in diabetes prevalence. The relationship between sugar consumption and diabetes risk is attenuated by adjustment for BMI, suggesting that sugar intake may have an independent effect on diabetes risk. However, it is important to note that the causality of this relationship remains to be fully elucidated, as the included studies were observational in nature.",NEI
Does a lower salt diet reduce the likelihood of cardiovascular disease?,Yes,"Evidence suggests that a reduction in dietary salt intake is associated with a decrease in blood pressure, which in turn may lower the risk of cardiovascular disease. Studies have shown that a modest reduction in salt intake, in line with public health recommendations, results in significant falls in blood pressure across different ethnic groups. Furthermore, a low-salt diet has been linked to a reduction in the incidence of hypertension and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. In addition to lowering blood pressure, salt reduction may also reduce other cardiovascular risk factors, such as urinary albumin excretion and arterial stiffness. However, it is important to note that the impact of lowering salt intake on metabolic vascular risk factors, such as insulin resistance and levels of atherogenic lipids, remains uncertain. Nonetheless, based on the available evidence, it can be concluded that a lower salt diet is likely to reduce the likelihood of cardiovascular disease.",Yes
Is less eaten from red plates?,Yes,"Recent studies have indicated that plate color can significantly influence food intake, with red plates potentially reducing consumption. The average total energy intake was found to be significantly lower when food was served on red plates (1102.16 ± 47.12 kcal) compared to black plates (1113.19 ± 47.12 kcal) and white plates (945.72 ± 47.12 kcal). This effect may be due to the environmental impact of plate color on food intake, as it has been shown to alter the amount of food consumed. The origin of this intriguing effect of the color red on consumption remains unclear, but the results suggest that red plates could be a useful strategy for controlling energy intake.",Yes
Does red wine protect better against cardiovascular disease than white wine?,Yes,"Evidence suggests that red wine may be more effective than other alcoholic beverages, including white wine, in decreasing the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) mortality. The higher levels of antioxidant polyphenols in red wine, such as resveratrol, are thought to contribute to its cardioprotective effects. Studies have shown that moderate consumption of red wine is associated with a lower incidence of cardiovascular disease and a relatively greater benefit than other alcoholic beverages in the prevention of atherosclerosis and CHD. The antioxidant components of red wine may provide cardioprotection by reducing oxidative stress in the heart under different pathological conditions. Although moderate drinking of any alcohol helps to reduce the incidence of coronary heart disease, there is no clear evidence that red wine confers an additional benefit beyond its antioxidant properties. However, international comparison data suggest that wine, particularly red wine, may be more protective against coronary artery disease than beer or liquor.",NEI
Do azo food dyes cause attention deficit disorder and hyperactivity in children?,Yes,"Scientific Explanation: The consumption of artificial food dyes during childhood and adolescence has been associated with neurobehavioral changes, such as hyperactivity. Research has proposed that these food colorings exacerbate hyperactive behavior in children. In a placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover clinical study, higher hyperactivity scores were observed in children when they were ingesting food colorings. Additionally, a meta-analysis of 15 double-blind clinical trials revealed an increase in hyperactive behavior in children already considered to be hyperactive when exposed to artificial food colorings. Although the mechanism underlying this phenomenon has not been fully elucidated, the available evidence suggests that it is best to avoid exposing children to artificial food colorings. The proposition that synthetic food colors can induce adverse behavioral effects in children was first enunciated in 1975 by Feingold. The available evidence supports the hypothesis that pesticide exposure at levels that do not cause acute toxicity may be among the multifactorial causes of ADHD and ASD. In conclusion, there is evidence that the removal of food colors from the diet can make a small improvement in the behavior of some children with ADHD.",NEI
Does turmeric prevent or cure cancer?,Yes,"Turmeric, specifically its active component curcumin, has been demonstrated to have significant potential in cancer prevention and treatment. Studies have shown that turmeric can effectively block the proliferation of tumor cells through the suppression of NF-κB and STAT3 pathways. It has also been observed to enhance the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which can induce apoptosis in cancer cells. Furthermore, turmeric has been found to inhibit the growth of malignant neoplasms and exhibit chemopreventive and growth inhibitory activity against several tumor cell lines. The protective effects of dietary turmeric converge on augmenting apoptosis of the initiated cells and decreasing cell proliferation, which in turn, is reflected in decreased tumor burden, multiplicity, and enhanced latency period. These findings suggest that turmeric has a promising role in cancer prevention and treatment, although further research is needed to fully understand its mechanisms of action and potential clinical applications.",NEI
Does breastfeeding reduce the risk of sudden infant death syndrome?,Yes,"Scientific evidence supports the claim that breastfeeding reduces the risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Epidemiological studies have consistently shown that breastfed infants are at a decreased risk of SIDS compared to formula-fed infants. Specifically, exclusive breastfeeding has been found to confer a stronger protective effect against SIDS than partial breastfeeding. The exact mechanism by which breastfeeding reduces the risk of SIDS is not fully understood, but it is thought to be related to the protective effects of breast milk against gastrointestinal pathogens and the promotion of a healthy immune system. Additionally, breastfeeding has been associated with a reduction in the risk of postneonatal death, which is a leading cause of infant mortality. While the duration of breastfeeding required to confer a protective effect against SIDS is unknown, early initiation of breastfeeding has been shown to reduce neonatal and early infant mortality through both exclusive breastfeeding and additional mechanisms. Therefore, promoting breastfeeding has the potential to save or delay a significant number of postneonatal deaths each year.",Yes
"Do boron preparations such as borax, boric acid, or calcium fructoborate relieve pain associated with age-related joint wear (osteoarthritis)?",Yes,"Evidence suggests that boron preparations, such as borax, boric acid, and calcium fructoborate, may alleviate pain associated with age-related joint wear, also known as osteoarthritis. Analytical evidence has shown lower boron concentrations in femur heads, bones, and synovial fluid from people with arthritis compared to those without the disorder. Observational evidence has demonstrated that bones of patients using boron supplements are harder to cut than those of patients not using supplements. Epidemiological evidence has indicated that areas with higher boron intakes have lower incidences of arthritis. Experimental evidence has shown that rats with induced arthritis benefit from orally or intraperitoneally administered boron, and a double-blind placebo-boron supplementation trial with 20 subjects with osteoarthritis has provided further support for the use of boron as a treatment for some forms of arthritis. Boron has been shown to beneficially affect bone growth and central nervous system function, alleviate arthritic symptoms, and facilitate hormone action. In vitro, animal, and human experiments have demonstrated that boron is a bioactive element in nutritional amounts. A significant favorable response to a 6 mg boron/day supplement was obtained in a collagenase-induced rabbit model of osteoarthritis, with 50% of subjects receiving the supplement improving compared to only 10% receiving the placebo. Boron may also form boroester complexes with phosphoinositides, glycoproteins, and glycolipids that affect cell membrane integrity and function, suggesting that it influences the formation and/or activity of substances involved in numerous biochemical processes. Overall, increasing boron intake by consuming a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, nuts, and pulses is a reasonable dietary recommendation to enhance health and well-being, and further research into the use of boron for the treatment or prevention of arthritis is warranted.",No
Can glutamate in food cause intolerance symptoms?,Yes,"Glutamate, a popular food additive, has been associated with concerns regarding its potential to cause excitotoxicity and neuron death, as well as its ability to cross the blood-brain barrier. While glutamate is a crucial neurotransmitter in the mammalian central nervous system, its excessive intake can lead to adverse effects. Glutamate is also the most frequently encountered food excitotoxin, and it has been shown to penetrate certain brain regions and rapidly destroy neurons by hyperactivating the NMDA subtype of glutamate receptor. Furthermore, several reports correlate monosodium glutamate (MSG) consumption with a series of unwanted reactions, including headaches and mechanical sensitivity in pericranial muscles. Therefore, it is plausible that glutamate in food can cause intolerance symptoms in certain individuals.",Yes
Does the Orthopulse device accelerate the orthodontic correction of malocclusions?,NEI,"Justification: The context does not provide explicit information regarding the Orthopulse device and its impact on accelerating orthodontic correction of malocclusions. However, it does mention several innovative techniques, such as Periodontally Accelerated Osteogenic Orthodontics (PAOO) and Improved Accelerated Osteogenic Orthodontics (IAOO), which combine alveolar corticotomy, bone graft materials, and orthodontic forces to accelerate tooth movement and reduce treatment time. These techniques have been reported to significantly accelerate orthodontic tooth movement and minimize the time taken for orthodontic treatment. As the Orthopulse device is not mentioned in the context, it is not possible to definitively state whether it accelerates the orthodontic correction of malocclusions.",Yes
Is it harmful for the mental development of the unborn child if the mother regularly eats fish contaminated with mercury during pregnancy?,Yes,", it can be harmful.

Justification: The study indicates that high levels of mercury exposure to the pregnant woman can result in damage to the brain of the developing fetus. Maternal fish consumption exposes the mother to methylmercury, which can have neurotoxic effects. While fish consumption during pregnancy has been associated with better infant cognition, higher mercury levels have been linked to lower cognition. The relationship between intrauterine exposure to mercury and offspring IQ appears to be benign provided the mother consumes fish, but there is concern that the consumption of fish by pregnant women could adversely affect their fetuses due to the presence of methylmercury. The study found no evidence to suggest that prenatal levels of maternal blood mercury were associated with adverse development of the child, even when the mother had consumed no fish during pregnancy. However, the possibility of harm to the fetus due to maternal fish consumption and exposure to methylmercury remains a topic of investigation.",NEI
Can the consumption of caffeine during pregnancy harm the unborn child?,Yes,"Justification: The context suggests that over-consumption of caffeine during pregnancy has been linked to a range of potential adverse influences, including its pharmacological effects on the fetus and neonate, its teratogenicity, its possible effect on intrauterine growth, and its possible involvement in reproductive loss. Epidemiological studies have also suggested that maternal caffeine exposure during pregnancy is associated with increased abnormalities, including decreased fertility, delayed conception, early spontaneous abortions, and low birth weight. Furthermore, studies have found that caffeine consumption during pregnancy may alter many activities that are ultimately associated with cognitive dysfunction in offspring. Therefore, it can be concluded that the consumption of caffeine during pregnancy has the potential to harm the unborn child.",Yes
Are vegetables prepared in a microwave oven less healthy than those prepared in other ways?,No,"The healthiness of vegetables prepared in a microwave oven compared to other cooking methods is contingent upon the specific cooking conditions employed. Generally, microwave steaming retains vitamins and phytochemicals in vegetables better than boiling, and is rated significantly higher in terms of acceptability for broccoli. However, the microwave cooking process presents controversial results in the literature due to the different conditions that are employed, such as time, power, and added water. In general, the longest microwave cooking time and the higher volume of cooking water should be avoided to minimize losses of nutrients. Non-uniform heating is a major food safety concern in not-ready-to-eat microwaveable foods, but placing food near the edge of the turntable can help promote uniform heating. Therefore, it cannot be definitively stated that vegetables prepared in a microwave oven are less healthy than those prepared in other ways.",NEI
Can garlic extract reduce high blood pressure and thus the risk of cardiovascular disease?,Yes,"Evidence from a meta-analysis and epidemiological studies suggests that garlic consumption is associated with a reduction in blood pressure in both hypertensive and normotensive individuals. The blood pressure-lowering properties of garlic are biologically plausible, and its consumption has been shown to reduce the risk of hypertension and ischemic heart disease. Garlic supplements have been found to be effective in reducing blood pressure in hypertensive patients, similarly to first-line standard anti-hypertensive medications. Aged garlic extract has been suggested to be an effective and tolerable treatment for uncontrolled hypertension, and may be considered as a safe adjunct treatment to conventional antihypertensive therapy. Additionally, garlic indirectly affects atherosclerosis by reducing hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and probably diabetes mellitus, and prevents thrombus formation. Therefore, regular garlic supplementation has been shown to reduce cardiovascular risk.",Yes
Can fructose damage the liver?,Yes,"Fructose, when metabolized by the liver, has been associated with hepatotoxicity under conditions of elevated delivery. High fructose intake has been shown to increase circulating alanine transaminase in humans, which could indicate damage to the liver. Fructose consumption has been linked to metabolic alterations and the severity of liver fibrosis in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Animal studies have suggested that fructose impairs intestinal integrity and leads to hepatic steatosis. Excessive intake of fructose increases lipogenesis in the liver, leading to hepatic lipid accumulation and development of fatty liver disease. Furthermore, fructose has been implicated as a cause of NAFLD and produces hepatic insulin resistance in humans and animals. Therefore, it can be concluded that fructose can damage the liver.",Yes
Can green tea affect the likelihood of dying early and reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease?,Yes,"The consumption of green tea has been associated with a decrease in cardiovascular mortality. This is due to its potential role in preventing cardiovascular disorders, as suggested by epidemiological studies. The antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of green tea, attributed to its polyphenolic catechins, contribute to this effect. Green tea consumption has been inversely associated with the development and progression of cardiovascular diseases and risk factors. It has also been shown to lower plasma levels of cholesterol and triglyceride, which are known risk factors for coronary heart disease. Furthermore, green tea consumption has been associated with a reduced risk of other diseases that cause functional disability, such as stroke, cognitive impairment, and osteoporosis. Therefore, it can be concluded that green tea consumption may indeed affect the likelihood of dying early and reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.",NEI
Is matcha tea particularly healthy?,Yes,"Justification: Matcha tea has been suggested to possess greater potential health benefits than other green teas due to its higher intake of green tea phytochemicals. The present study indicates that matcha tea, consumed in a realistic dose, can induce slight effects on speed of attention and episodic secondary memory. Matcha is richer in some nutritional elements and epigallocatechin 3-o-gallate than other green teas. The concentration of epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) available from drinking matcha is 137 times greater than that from China Green Tips green tea and at least three times higher than the largest literature value for other green teas. Matcha has been shown to protect against hepatic and renal damage through the suppression of renal age accumulation, decreases in hepatic glucose, triglyceride, and total cholesterol levels, and by its antioxidant activities. Matcha supplementation has also resulted in decreases in renal expressions of cml, cel, and rage, as well as an increase in hepatic srebp-2 expression. Encouraging data showing cancer-preventive effects of green tea from cell-culture, animal, and human studies have emerged. Therefore, it can be concluded that matcha tea is particularly healthy.",Yes
Can acupuncture prevent migraines and tension headaches?,Yes,"Acupuncture has been shown to be an effective prophylactic measure for patients with frequent or insufficiently controlled migraine attacks, according to a Cochrane review. Multiple clinical trials and systematic reviews have confirmed the effectiveness of acupuncture in preventing episodic migraines. Acupuncture has been found to significantly influence migraine frequency and intensity, with benefits lasting up to 12 weeks after the final acupuncture session. The specific mechanisms of acupuncture are not clearly understood, but it is postulated that acupuncture at active acupoints may have the potential effect of regulating some disease-affected key regions and pain circuitry for migraine, and promote establishing psychophysical pain homeostasis. Inhibition of dural mast cells, macrophages, and serum inflammatory factors may be one of the mechanisms involved in acupuncture treatment's effect on migraine. Acupuncture is also a validated non-pharmaceutical option for treating migraine and may be a choice for menstrual-related migraine when pharmacological prophylaxis is not suitable.",No
Can green tea reduce the likelihood of dying from cancer ?,NEI,"The context suggests that green tea consumption is associated with a reduced risk of certain types of cancers, including stomach, oral cavity, esophagus, lung, and prostate. Green tea may reduce cancer risk through several mechanisms, including scavenging oxidative radicals, inhibition of tumor initiation, and modulation of detoxification enzymes. However, the context does not provide information on the impact of green tea consumption on cancer mortality. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether green tea can reduce the likelihood of dying from cancer based solely on the given context. Further research is needed to establish a causal relationship between green tea consumption and cancer mortality.",Yes
Can plant sterols or foods with them reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease?,Yes,"Plant sterols and stanols are structurally similar to cholesterol and are known to reduce serum total- and LDL-cholesterol concentrations when added to the diet. The lowering of LDL cholesterol levels by plant sterols and stanols is associated with a decreased risk of cardiovascular disease in humans. Plant sterol-enriched foods are an effective dietary adjuvant in reducing cardiovascular risk by lowering total cholesterol and LDL-C in serum by up to approximately 15%. The consumption of products enriched with plant sterol or stanol esters lowers serum total and LDL-cholesterol concentrations, thereby most likely reducing the risk of coronary heart disease. Plant sterol-enriched foods provide clinicians with a relatively cheap, safe, and effective way to help patients manage their cardiovascular risk. Experimental studies have shown plant sterols to be an important part of the serum-cholesterol lowering effect of certain diets and dietary components. In conclusion, plant sterols and stanols effectively reduce serum LDL cholesterol and atherosclerotic risk. Epidemiological data show that individuals with higher intakes of plant sterols from their habitual diets have lower serum-cholesterol levels. The consumption of dietary plant sterols should be a part of dietary advice to patients with hypercholesterolemia and the general public for the prevention and management of coronary heart disease.",Yes
Can too much iodine cause autoimmune thyroid disease and consequently hypothyroidism?,Yes,"Scientific evidence supports the claim that excessive iodine intake can indeed cause autoimmune thyroid disease and consequently lead to hypothyroidism. This phenomenon has been observed in both human and animal studies. Iodine, an essential component of thyroid hormones, plays a crucial role in thyroid function. However, when consumed in excess, it can trigger the development of autoimmune thyroid diseases such as Hashimoto's thyroiditis. This occurs through a dose-dependent mechanism, where prolonged intake of large amounts of iodine increases the incidence of hypothyroidism. The interaction of excess iodine with the immune system can trigger the onset and development of autoimmune thyroiditis. This leads to a higher prevalence of autoimmune thyroiditis, hypothyroidism, goiter, as well as hyperthyroidism, particularly in the elderly. It is important to note that the mechanisms involved in this process remain poorly understood, but the evidence suggests that high concentrations of iodide may induce thyroid dysfunction not only through biochemical but also immunological mechanisms.",NEI
Is the sweetener aspartame harmful to health?,Inconclusive,"The safety of aspartame, a widely consumed artificial sweetener, remains controversial. While some studies suggest a potential link between aspartame intake and adverse neural effects, particularly in the developing brain, other research indicates that consumption of aspartame by normal humans is safe and not associated with serious adverse health effects. The present scientific data regarding the toxicity of aspartame and its possible association with carcinogenesis, specifically colorectal cancer, are inconclusive. It has been reported that consumption of aspartame could cause neurological and behavioral disturbances in sensitive individuals, but further research is needed to establish a definitive causal relationship. The safety concerns surrounding aspartame's component amino acids, aspartic acid and phenylalanine, as well as its major decomposition products, methanol and diketopiperazine, also warrant further investigation. Therefore, based on the available evidence, it is not possible to definitively conclude that aspartame is harmful to health.",NEI
Does coffee affect cancer death risk?,Yes,"Justification: The findings suggest that coffee consumption is associated with decreased risk of mortality from cancer. Epidemiological studies indicate that coffee consumption reduces the risk of cancers, including colon cancer. A significant association was found between coffee consumption and decreased risk of colorectal and colon cancer among subjects consuming ≥4 cups of coffee per day. However, it is important to note that smoking modifies the observed risk when studying the role of coffee on human health. There was no observational association between coffee intake and overall cancer death. Therefore, while coffee consumption might impact the prevention of certain cancers, its effect on cancer death risk remains unclear and requires further investigation.",NEI
Do diets with primarily or exclusively uncooked foods have health benefits?,Yes,"Evidence suggests that diets rich in whole and unrefined foods, such as whole grains, dark green and yellow/orange-fleshed vegetables and fruits, legumes, nuts, and seeds, contain high concentrations of antioxidant phenolics, fibers, and numerous other phytochemicals that may be protective against chronic diseases. These foods are often consumed in their raw or minimally processed state. Conversely, consumption of ultra-processed foods has been associated with low diet quality, obesity, and other non-communicable diseases. Therefore, it can be inferred that diets with primarily or exclusively uncooked foods may have health benefits due to their higher nutritional content and lower energy density compared to ultra-processed foods.",NEI
Can increased water consumption prevent migraines or other headaches?,Yes,", with caveats

Justification: Evidence suggests that increased water consumption is associated with a significant reduction in migraine disability, pain severity, headache frequency, and duration of headaches. This cost-effective, non-invasive intervention has been shown to decrease the total number of hours and intensity of headache episodes after increased water intake. However, it is important to note that the effectiveness of increasing water intake in preventing migraines or other headaches has not been fully established, and further clinical trials are needed to interpret the causal relationship. Additionally, while drinking more water has been found to improve migraine-specific quality of life, it did not result in relevant changes in days with at least moderate headache. Therefore, while increased water consumption appears to have a positive impact on headache properties, its preventive role in migraines or other headaches remains to be fully understood.",No
"Offer the following herbal appetite suppressants effective and safe weight loss support: Devil's Tongue (Konjac Root), Caralluma fimbriata, Garcinia cambogia, Gymnea sylvestre, Ephedra, Irvinia gabonensis, Fenugreek, Hoodia gordonii, Common Bean, Bitter Orange?",Insufficient,"Information

The context provided does not explicitly mention the herbs listed in the question. However, it does mention Hoodia gordonii as an appetite suppressant and weight loss herb. Without further information, it is not possible to definitively state whether the other herbs listed are effective and safe for weight loss support. It is important to note that while many herbs have been traditionally used for various health purposes, their safety and efficacy must be evaluated through scientific research. Additionally, the use of herbal supplements should be discussed with a healthcare provider to ensure they are appropriate and safe for individual use.",Yes
Are there health benefits to screening the general population for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) as a precaution?,Yes,"Evidence suggests that there are health benefits to screening the general population for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) as a precaution. Individuals with known risk factors, such as current and former smokers, are particularly important targets for screening and early intervention. Screening programs utilizing tools such as the COPD Population Screener (COPD-PS) questionnaire and handheld spirometers (COPD-6) have been shown to increase yields of COPD diagnosis and respiratory-related clinician actions in primary care. Early detection of COPD may reduce the future burden of the disease, as COPD is a treatable condition and identifying COPD subjects is crucial for effective management. Furthermore, patients with COPD are at an increased risk of developing lung cancer, and may benefit from screening at lower pack-year thresholds. Future trials are needed to evaluate the effectiveness of screening in improving outcomes for patients with COPD. Until such studies have shown convincing results, screening for pre-clinical COPD in general practice should not be recommended without a cost-benefit analysis in favor of screening.",NEI
Can cow's milk cause iron deficiency in babies in the first year of life?,Yes,"Justification: The introduction of cow's milk to infants in their first year of life has been associated with iron deficiency and anemia. This is due to the low iron content of cow's milk, which can lead to depleted iron stores and subsequent deficiency. Early introduction of cow's milk, particularly before 24 weeks, has been linked to iron deficiency and anemia. Furthermore, excessive consumption of cow's milk can result in severe iron deficiency anemia during the second year of life in infants with greater than average birth weight. The use of fresh cow's milk and unfortified cow's milk formulas and cereal products has also been shown to predispose infants to iron deficiency. Therefore, it is recommended that iron-fortified formulas be used instead of whole cow's milk during the first year of life, if human milk is not available.",Yes
Does cow's milk for babies have other health disadvantages??,Yes,"Justification: Whole cow's milk has been identified as detrimental to infants due to its low iron content, which can lead to anemia and iron deficiency, subsequently associated with lower childhood developmental scores. Early introduction of cow's milk is a risk factor for the development of these conditions. Furthermore, recent literature suggests that consuming whole cow's milk in infancy has unfortunate effects on growth, particularly weight acceleration and the development of overweight in childhood. The consumption of whole milk after the first year of life should be discouraged due to its potential role in various disorders, including atherosclerosis, recurrent abdominal pain of childhood, cataracts, milk-borne infections, and juvenile delinquency. Additionally, whole bovine milk should not be fed to infants during the first year of life because of its association with occult gastrointestinal bleeding, iron deficiency anemia, and cow's milk allergy.",NEI
Does drinking breast milk as a baby have a positive effect on later health and development?,Yes,"Evidence suggests that breast milk consumption in infancy has a positive impact on later health and development. Breast milk contains a nutrient composition that matches the nutritional needs of children, promoting infant growth and conferring numerous benefits to newborns and developing infants. Breastfeeding has been associated with improved neurodevelopment, with cognitive scores linked to head size, indicating that breast milk may mediate cognitive effects by affecting brain growth. Additionally, studies have reported a positive relationship between breastfeeding duration and IQ in childhood, as well as higher cognitive scores in later life among those who were breastfed for at least six months. Beyond cognitive development, breast milk consumption has been linked to long-term health benefits, such as prolonging the birth interval to subsequent siblings and increasing earning ability. However, it is important to note that observational findings may be confounded by factors associated with mothers' choice to breastfeed.",NEI
Does Almased help with excess weight better than other diets?,NEI,"The question posed cannot be definitively answered due to insufficient information regarding Almased's specific effects on weight loss compared to other diets. However, it is known that a variety of diets, including those with energy restriction, can lead to weight loss when adhered to. The inclusion of almonds in an energy-restricted diet has been reported to enhance weight loss, but the effects of Almased are not specifically addressed in the provided context. Additionally, systematic reviews and meta-analyses indicate that all diets work when adhered to, and initial weight loss can predict the amount of weight lost and maintained for up to 4 years. Therefore, it is important to consider individual dietary needs and preferences when selecting a diet for weight loss.",NEI
"Do products with talc, such as baby powder, increase the risk of ovarian cancer?",Yes,"Scientific evidence suggests that there may be a positive association between perineal use of talc powder and an increased risk of ovarian cancer, particularly invasive serous ovarian cancer. Epidemiological studies have indicated a possible link between genital talc use and ovarian carcinoma, with some studies reporting an increased risk among talc users. Although there is no definitive proof that talc used externally reaches the pelvis, vaginal exposures to talc and other particulates may play an etiologic role in epithelial ovarian cancer. However, it is important to note that not all epidemiologic investigations have found an association between talc use and ovarian cancer risk, and more research is needed to fully understand the relationship between the two.",NEI
"Do large portions, large plates or glasses, and larger packaging cause us to eat and drink more?",Yes,"Justification: The scientific evidence supports the claim that larger portion sizes, plates, glasses, and packaging can lead to increased food and beverage consumption. This phenomenon, known as the portion size effect, is well-documented in numerous studies. Larger portions and containers can unknowingly bias individuals to serve and consume more, leading to higher energy intake levels. Additionally, the size-contrast illusion suggests that food appears larger when plated on smaller dishes, which may contribute to the perception of appropriate portion sizes and subsequent overeating. The increase in portion sizes of high-caloric foods and drinks has been linked to the rise in obesity rates, further supporting the notion that larger portions can contribute to overconsumption and weight gain.",NEI
Does taking coconut oil improve mental abilities in dementia like Alzheimer's disease?,Yes,"Evidence suggests that coconut oil may have potential benefits in lessening cognitive deficits associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). An isocaloric coconut oil enriched Mediterranean diet has been observed to improve cognitive functions in AD patients, with differences according to patient sex and degree of severity of the disease. Coconut oil contains large amounts of medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs) and its consumption is thought to stimulate hepatic ketogenesis, supplying an alternative energy source for brains with impaired glucose metabolism. After intervention with coconut oil, improvements in episodic, temporal orientation, and semantic memory were observed, with a more evident positive effect in women with mild-moderate state. Coconut oil supplementation has also been shown to directly activate ketogenesis in astrocytes, providing fuel to neighboring neurons. Furthermore, coconut oil co-treatment attenuates amyloid-β induced mitochondrial alterations and rescues neuron survival in cultures co-treated with coconut oil and amyloid-β compared to cultures exposed only to amyloid-β. However, more studies are needed to fully understand the effects of coconut oil on cognitive function in AD patients.",Yes
"Does the preparation ""CAPS immu"" from Ringana reduce the risk of infections in healthy people?",Yes,"The scientific evidence suggests that a proprietary larch arabinogalactan preparation has the potential to enhance the body's defense against common cold infections. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, 199 healthy participants who had a self-reported cold infection rate of three in 6 months were randomly assigned to receive either 4.5g of an arabinogalactan preparation or placebo over a period of 12 weeks. The results showed that the number of participants affected by a cold was significantly reduced by arabinogalactan supplementation (p=0.038). Therefore, it can be inferred that the preparation ""CAPS immu"" from Ringana, which contains larch arabinogalactan, may reduce the risk of infections in healthy people.",Yes
Do extracts from grape seeds have a health-promoting effect?,Yes,"Evidence from various studies suggests that extracts from grape seeds possess a diverse array of biological actions and may have health-promoting effects. Grape seed extracts have been shown to contain polyphenols, such as proanthocyanidins, which have been demonstrated to have beneficial health effects in preventing dyslipidemia and cardiovascular diseases. Furthermore, grape seed extracts have been reported to prevent weight gain, moderate hyperglycemia, and reduce inflammation. The antioxidant and antiplatelet properties of grape products are thought to be responsible for observed antiatherosclerotic effects. Additionally, grape seed proanthocyanidins have been shown to improve endothelial function and arteriosclerosis. Overall, these findings suggest that grape seed extracts may have a health-promoting effect, particularly in the prevention of inflammatory-mediated diseases such as cardiovascular disease.",NEI
Is the administration of magnesium through the skin effective?,Yes,"Justification: The administration of magnesium through the skin has been demonstrated to be effective based on anecdotal evidence and published reports. Upon topical application of magnesium solution, it has been found that magnesium penetrates through the human stratum corneum, the outermost layer of the epidermis, and this process depends on the concentration and time of exposure. The primary aim of a study was to estimate the extent of magnesium ion permeation through human skin and the role of hair follicles in facilitating the permeation. Topical magnesium delivery is one of the oldest forms of therapy for skin diseases, such as Dead Sea therapy and Epsom salt baths. Additionally, magnesium has been developed as a drug with various clinical uses and is an essential element involved in various biochemical processes in the human body. Therefore, it can be concluded that the administration of magnesium through the skin is effective.",Yes
Do kava kava supplements help with anxiety disorders?,Yes,"Recent clinical trials suggest that kava (Piper methysticum) has therapeutic value for the treatment of anxiety. Kava, a widely used herbal remedy, is commonly employed for managing mild to moderate cases of anxiety. Its advantages over conventional pharmacologic treatments include better tolerability and lack of physiological dependence and withdrawal. Kava extracts have shown potential in minimizing anxiety-associated symptoms and alleviating pain. The data support the safety of kava in treating anxiety at 280 mg kava lactones/day for 4 weeks. Although the mechanism of action and the extent to which kava may serve as an alternative to pharmaceutical anxiolytics are not fully known, growing research indicates that kava most likely alters concentrations of coadministered psychotropics by inhibiting cytochrome p450 enzymes. Kava extract has demonstrated statistically significant dose-dependent anxiolytic-like behavioral changes in both assays of anxiolysis, exhibiting anxiolytic effects in the plus maze test and increasing the locomotor activity of mice in the open field test.",NEI
Do ultrasound devices help against dust mites?,NEI,"The context provided does not explicitly address the use of ultrasound devices against dust mites. However, it does discuss the potential of ultrasound for disinfection and its synergistic effect with natural compounds. The context also mentions the use of ultrasound for cleaning medical devices and its potential for enhancing traditional washing treatments. The key role in the action of ultrasound in cleaning and disinfection is played by cavitation phenomena. While the context does not provide direct evidence on the effectiveness of ultrasound against dust mites, it suggests that ultrasound could potentially be used for pest repellent systems. However, further research is needed to establish its effectiveness against dust mites.",NEI
"Does the risk of food allergy decrease if babies are fed potentially allergenic foods (cow's milk, peanuts, chicken egg) as late as possible for the first time?",No,"Recent research suggests that the early introduction of potentially allergenic foods (at 4 to 6 months of age) might actually provide a form of protection and help prevent allergy. There is no evidence that delaying the introduction of any specific food beyond 6 months of age helps to prevent allergy. In fact, early exposure to cow's milk protein in the first 3 months of life was associated with a reduced risk of cow's milk allergy. Specifically, new guidelines suggest early ingestion of peanut as a means to prevent peanut allergy. Therefore, it is not accurate to state that the risk of food allergy decreases if babies are fed potentially allergenic foods as late as possible for the first time.",Yes
"for fish, sesame, wheat?",Yes,"The context suggests that fish and seafood play an important role in providing essential vitamins, minerals, and fatty acids for human nutrition and food security. It also indicates that plant materials, including wheat and legumes, make up the largest part of aquafeeds for fish. The study examines the effects of fishmeal replacement with plant meals, such as wheat gluten, soy, or pea protein concentrate, on the performance of juvenile olive flounder and other fish species. The results show that fish and shellfish are good dietary sources of several vitamins and minerals, and whole fish are more nutrient-dense than fillet samples. Therefore, it can be inferred that fish, sesame, and wheat can be combined in a diet to provide a range of essential nutrients. However, the specific nutritional benefits of combining these three foods would depend on the quantities and preparation methods used.",NEI
"Can willow bark tea help with inflammation, pain or fever?",Yes,"The potential anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects of tea, including willow bark tea, have been demonstrated through various studies. The polyphenolic components in tea, such as salicin and procyanidins, are suggested to contribute to its overall health benefits. In particular, black tea decoction has shown significant anti-inflammatory effects in both acute and chronic inflammatory models. The anti-inflammatory activity of willow bark tea can be attributed to its salicin content, which is a precursor to salicylic acid, a known anti-inflammatory compound. Therefore, it can be inferred that willow bark tea may help with inflammation, pain, or fever. However, further research is needed to confirm its efficacy and safety in humans.",Yes
"Can a supposedly ""high acid"" diet weaken bones?",Yes,"Evidence suggests that a diet high in acid-producing foods can negatively impact bone health. This is due to the increased urinary acid and calcium excretion generated by such a diet, which can lead to a slight but significant metabolic acidosis. This metabolic acidosis may result in greater loss of bone mineral and increased potential for fractures. The imbalance between dietary acid and base precursors can create a chronic net dietary acid load, which may have adverse consequences on bone. However, it is important to note that sufficient calcium intake might neutralize this effect. Additionally, the effect of diet on bone mineral density, fracture risk, and markers of bone formation and resorption is not always straightforward, suggesting that other factors may also be influencing the effect of acid/alkali loading on bone.",No
"Does a supposedly ""alkaline-rich"" diet prevent chronic diseases?",NEI,"The claim that an alkaline-rich diet prevents chronic diseases remains inconclusive based on the available evidence. While several studies suggest that neutralizing the acid load in the diet with alkali may have favorable effects on intermediate markers of musculoskeletal health, a causal association between dietary acid load and osteoporotic bone disease is not supported by evidence. Additionally, there is no evidence that an alkaline diet is protective of bone health. However, there is increasing evidence that alkali therapy can retard the progression of chronic kidney disease. Further studies are warranted to establish the role of an alkaline diet in reducing morbidity and mortality from chronic diseases.",NEI
Can a blood test detect mental illness?,Yes,"Recent advancements in neurobiological research have identified potential biomarkers in blood that could aid in the diagnosis and monitoring of mental illnesses. These biomarkers, known as transcriptomic biomarkers, can be obtained from peripheral tissues such as blood cells, making them clinically accessible and practical for use in discerning molecular subtypes of complex psychiatric diseases. The analysis of blood-based gene expression signatures with supervised classifiers, such as ANNs, has shown potential as a diagnostic tool for conditions like schizophrenia. Moreover, the examination of gene expression signatures in whole blood has indicated that it may contain sufficient information to make specific diagnoses of mental illnesses, including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depression. Additionally, the membrane potential of blood cells has been suggested as a diagnostic marker to augment the DSM-IV diagnosis of bipolar disorder I. These findings suggest that blood tests may offer an unexpectedly informative window into brain functioning and disease state, thereby aiding in the detection and management of mental illnesses.",No
Is surgery for an anterior cruciate ligament tear (by replacing the broken anterior cruciate ligament with tendon tissue from another part of the leg) followed by physical therapy better than physical therapy alone?,NEI,"The effectiveness of surgical treatment versus conservative treatment for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries in allowing patients to return to physical activity is controversial. While surgical reconstruction with a tendon graft is the current gold standard for treating ACL ruptures, a randomized controlled trial found no significant difference in outcomes between early ACL reconstruction and optional delayed reconstruction at 2 years. Additionally, a quasi-randomized trial found no difference in the return to sports activities between patients treated surgically and those treated conservatively. However, competitive athletes who underwent reconstruction at a subacute stage had a higher activity level and desired level of activity compared to those who had the reconstruction delayed. Therefore, it is important to assess which patients may benefit from early surgical intervention and which may be successfully treated with nonoperative methods.",Yes
Can motherwort reduce migraine attacks?,NEI,"The context suggests that motherwort (yimucao), a traditional Chinese herb, has been shown to have beneficial effects for women's diseases. However, there is no specific mention or evidence of its efficacy in reducing migraine attacks. The hypothesis that the beneficial effects of motherwort may be related to angiogenesis does not directly address its potential impact on migraine. Therefore, based on the provided context, there is not enough information to definitively state whether motherwort can reduce migraine attacks. Further research is needed to establish a clear link between motherwort and migraine relief.",NEI
Does metal in bed disturb sleep?,NEI,"The provided context does not contain any information regarding the presence of metal in bed or its impact on sleep. Therefore, it is not possible to generate a definitive answer based solely on the given context. However, it is important to note that any factors that cause discomfort or anxiety can potentially disturb sleep. If the presence of metal in bed leads to such discomfort or anxiety, it could indirectly affect sleep quality. Nonetheless, this remains speculative without further evidence or information.",NEI
Does heat treatment (radiofrequency ablation or radiofrequency heat ablation of benign nodules of the thyroid gland work as well as conventional surgical methods?,Yes,"Heat treatment, specifically radiofrequency ablation (RFA), has been shown to be an effective alternative to conventional surgical methods for treating benign thyroid nodules. RFA is a minimally invasive technique that employs thermal energy to destroy targeted tissues, resulting in nodule shrinkage and symptom relief. Studies have demonstrated that RFA is a safe and efficient treatment option for managing symptomatic cold thyroid nodules or hyperfunctioning thyroid nodules. Furthermore, RFA has been shown to improve thyroid function and reduce nodule volume in autonomously functioning thyroid nodules. While evidence supporting the use of other thermal ablation techniques, such as laser-induced thermotherapy and high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU), is still limited, RFA has been advocated as an effective and well-tolerated treatment option for benign thyroid nodules. Therefore, heat treatment can be considered a viable alternative to conventional surgical methods for managing benign thyroid nodules.",Yes
Does Imunoglukan strengthen the immune system?,Yes,"Evidence suggests that Imunoglukan, also referred to as immulina®, has the potential to strengthen the immune system. Independent studies have demonstrated an enhancement of natural killer (NK) cell activity following administration of immulina® for seven days. This was observed through increased mRNA expression of NK cell markers, such as NKG2D and perforin, and a 40% average increase in the killing of K562 tumor cells by NK cells. Additionally, immulina® has been shown to stimulate the production of interleukin-1 receptor antagonist protein (IL-1ra) by mononuclear cells, which is proposed to be part of its therapeutic effect. These findings suggest that Imunoglukan may play a role in augmenting immune responses and potentially contribute to disease control and prevention.",NEI
Do cell phones promote the development and growth of tumors in the head?,NEI,"(Not Enough Information)

Evidence from various scientific studies suggests that the relationship between mobile phone use and the risk of intracranial tumors remains inconclusive. While some case-control studies have found a positive association between mobile phone use and the risk of tumors, others have reported no significant association. A meta-analysis and systematic review of scientific studies have been conducted to examine the effect of cellular phone use on the risk of brain tumor development. However, the results are not sufficient to evaluate the risks among long-term, heavy users and for potentially long induction periods. The International Agency for Research on Cancer has classified radiofrequency electromagnetic fields as 'possibly' carcinogenic to humans, but the evidence is not conclusive. In summary, while there is some concern about the potential adverse health effects of cell phones, including the possibility of causing brain tumors, more research is needed to establish a definitive link between mobile phone use and the development and growth of tumors in the head.",Yes
Does wearing bras promote breast cancer risk?,No,"The scientific study conducted did not establish an association between bra wearing and increased breast cancer risk among postmenopausal women. The results suggest that wearing bras does not promote breast cancer risk. It is essential to note that other factors, such as exposure to ionizing radiation, a history of benign breast disease, and extensive mammographic breast density, are associated with increased breast cancer risk. The study also found that postmenopausal exogenous female hormone use, in general, has not been well established to affect breast carcinoma risk among women with a history of proliferative breast disease with or without atypia. Therefore, the claim that wearing bras promotes breast cancer risk is not supported by the available scientific evidence.",NEI
Are tattoo inks harmful to health?,Yes,"Tattoo inks are a complex mixture of chemical impurities, which have the potential to pose long-term risks to human health. These inks contain components that can induce adaptive stress response pathways, and further work is required to understand the toxicokinetics of tattoo ink chemicals in the body. The presence of metallic pigments in tattoo inks has been linked to allergic contact dermatitis. Illegally imported tattoo inks can contain unknown ingredients and contamination, thereby posing a serious health hazard. The studied tattoo inks caused effects in all bioassays, with red and yellow tattoo inks having the greatest response, particularly inducing genotoxicity and oxidative stress response endpoints. Allergic reactions to tattoos are amongst the most common side effects occurring with this permanent deposition of pigments into the dermal skin layer. Tattooing is a tremendous exposure of the human body to needle operation, particles, and chemicals, and can be associated with a variety of inflammatory, infectious, and neoplastic complications. The biocompatibility of tattoo dyes has not been well researched, and further work is required to assess the toxicological hazard potential of tattoo ink chemicals.",Yes
Do plant hormones (phytoestrogens) other than genistein reduce the number and intensity of hot flashes during menopause?,Yes,"Phytoestrogens, including those other than genistein, have been shown to positively influence menopausal discomforts such as hot flashes. These plant hormones have estrogen-like hormone actions, which enable them to reduce the frequency and intensity of hot flashes. Certain botanicals containing phytoestrogenic activity, such as red clover, have been found to be beneficial in alleviating menopausal symptoms. The consumption of dietary phytoestrogens alters the neuroendocrine mechanism of core body temperature regulation, contributing to their effectiveness in managing hot flashes. In recent years, plants with high phytoestrogen content have been recommended as therapeutic agents for postmenopausal hormonal treatment. These substances can act as either agonists or antagonists of estrogen receptors α and β. Various plant-derived compounds and extracts have been developed for the treatment of menopause-related complaints and disorders. Further exploration is required to determine the long-term efficacy and role of combination botanicals in reducing menopausal symptoms.",NEI
Does the herbal hormone genistein reduce the number and intensity of hot flashes during menopause???,Yes,"Genistein, a naturally occurring phytoestrogen, has been shown to reduce the number and intensity of hot flashes during menopause. In a 24-month, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, subjects supplemented with genistein demonstrated a 51% reduction in the number of hot flushes by week 12 compared to a 27% reduction in the placebo group. Additionally, subjects on genistein had fewer hot flushes per day and a decrease in total duration of hot flushes per day at week 12 compared to placebo. The hormone-like actions of genistein are thought to be responsible for its beneficial effects in alleviating hot flashes and other menopausal discomforts. Genistein has also been shown to have a preventive role against bone mass loss during menopause and may have a cardioprotective role in postmenopausal women. Genistein is a plant estrogen promoted as an alternative to post-menopausal hormone therapy because of its good safety profile and its promotion as a natural product.",NEI
Does bloodletting according to Hildegard von Bingen have health benefits?,NEI,"The context provided does not contain information on the specific bloodletting method proposed by Hildegard von Bingen or its potential health benefits. Therefore, it is not possible to definitively conclude whether bloodletting according to Hildegard von Bingen has health benefits based solely on the information given. However, the context does indicate that bloodletting, in general, has been associated with reductions in key hemorheological variables and may have potential cardiovascular benefits. Further research is needed to determine the specific benefits of bloodletting according to Hildegard von Bingen.",NEI
Can FGXpress Power Strips reduce pain or improve wound healing?,NEI,"The claim that FGXpress Power Strips can reduce pain or improve wound healing cannot be definitively evaluated based on the provided context, as there is no mention of FGXpress Power Strips or their specific properties. However, the context discusses various therapeutic electrical stimulation (ES) modalities that have been found to be effective for wound healing, pain reduction, and edema reduction. These modalities include pulsed electromagnetic fields, electrical current, and monophasic pulsed microcurrent stimulation. The context also mentions that ES can increase the rate of healing by more than 50%. Therefore, it is plausible that FGXpress Power Strips, if they utilize a similar ES technology, could potentially have a positive impact on wound healing and pain reduction. However, further research is needed to establish the specific effects of FGXpress Power Strips.",NEI
Does treatment according to the fascial distortion model help with chronic shoulder pain?,NEI,"The context does not provide specific information regarding the effectiveness of the fascial distortion model for treating chronic shoulder pain. However, it does indicate that various interventions, including multimodal treatments and manipulative therapy, have been effective in reducing pain, increasing range of motion, and improving function in patients with chronic shoulder pain. Given that the fascial distortion model is a treatment approach that focuses on addressing fascial restrictions and distortions in the body, it is plausible that it could be effective in managing chronic shoulder pain. However, further research is needed to establish its efficacy in this regard.",Yes
Are there effective alternatives to the breathing mask (CPAP) for sleep apnea?,Yes,"Justification: There are indeed effective alternatives to Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) therapy delivered via a nasal mask for sleep apnea. These alternatives include Adaptive Servo-Ventilation (ASV), oral appliances, drug therapy, and surgical interventions. ASV has been found to be more reliably effective than CPAP in relieving complex sleep apnea syndrome. Oral appliances are also a viable alternative for the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea. Drug therapy has been proposed as an alternative to CPAP in some patients with mild to moderate sleep apnea. However, it is important to note that CPAP remains the gold standard treatment for obstructive sleep apnea, particularly for moderate to severe cases. The choice of therapy depends on the individual patient's needs and preferences, as well as the specific type and severity of sleep apnea.",Yes
Does closure of the foramen ovale prevent further strokes in people who have had a stroke of unknown cause?,NEI,"(Not Enough Information)

Justification: The efficacy of closure of a patent foramen ovale (PFO) in the prevention of recurrent stroke after cryptogenic stroke remains uncertain. While some studies suggest that PFO closure may prevent recurrent stroke in patients aged 60 years or younger, the overall effect of foramen ovale closure on the risk for subsequent strokes is unknown. The role of surgical closure of PFO for cerebral infarction or transient ischemic attack resulting from paradoxical embolism is unclear, and its effect on recurrence is unknown. Although paradoxical embolism through a PFO is a recognized cause of stroke, clinical predictors, recurrence rate, and prevention of brain infarcts in patients with PFO have not been determined. While collaboration between investigators has yielded a database with sufficient power to identify those patients at highest risk for a PFO-related stroke recurrence who may have the greatest potential benefit from PFO closure, the available research results do not conclusively suggest a causal relationship between PFO and stroke. Therefore, the question of whether closure of the foramen ovale prevents further strokes in people who have had a stroke of unknown cause remains unresolved.",Yes
Does stimulation current therapy (TENS - Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation) help with worn knee joints (knee osteoarthritis)?,Yes,"Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS) has been shown to relieve pain and improve function in patients with knee osteoarthritis. A recent meta-analysis study provides strong evidence supporting the effectiveness of TENS in managing osteoarthritis knee pain. TENS has been proposed as an adjunct to the current standard of care in treating knee osteoarthritis pain. A four-week treatment period of repeated TENS application has been evaluated and found to have a cumulative effect on chronic osteoarthritic knee pain. TENS has also been studied in combination with a group education and exercise program, demonstrating additional effects for knee osteoarthritis. TENS has been proposed as a nonoperative treatment for osteoarthritis and has been found to improve pain, function, and quality of life in patients with painful osteoarthritic knees over a three-month period. TENS has also been found to significantly reduce pain and morphine requirement over a 24-hour period and promote functional recovery in patients who have undergone total knee arthroplasty. TENS has been shown to improve physical function in terms of range of knee motion and the timed-up-and-go test. In conclusion, TENS has been found to improve some physical parameters and produce significant improvement in functional performance among people with knee osteoarthritis.",NEI
Does taking magnesium salts decrease the frequency and intensity of muscle cramps with unknown cause?,No,"The claim that taking magnesium salts decreases the frequency and intensity of muscle cramps with unknown cause cannot be substantiated. A double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized controlled trial conducted on 46 community-dwelling older adults revealed that intravenous magnesium infusion did not reduce the frequency of leg cramps, regardless of the extent to which infused magnesium was retained. The mean change in the number of cramps per week, magnesium versus placebo arms, was -2.4 versus -1.7, with a p-value of .51, indicating no significant difference between the two groups. Although oral magnesium supplements are marketed for the prophylaxis of such cramps, clinical trials exploring the efficacy of oral magnesium have yielded conflicting results. Therefore, the available evidence does not support the use of magnesium therapy for the treatment of rest cramps in a geriatric population.",NEI
Does taking magnesium salts reduce the frequency and intensity of exercise-induced muscle cramps during sports?,NEI,"The role of magnesium salts in reducing the frequency and intensity of exercise-induced muscle cramps remains speculative, with limited scientific research on the subject. Although magnesium is essential for optimal sports performance and its status in athletes is of interest, the causes and cures for cramps that occur during or soon after exercise remain uncertain. While some cases may be associated with disturbances of water and salt balance, others appear to involve sustained abnormal spinal reflex activity secondary to fatigue of the affected muscles. The ingestion of transient receptor potential (TRP) channel agonists has been efficacious in attenuating electrically induced muscle cramps, but the relevance of these studies to the spontaneous cramps that occur during exercise is questionable. Therefore, more research is needed to determine the role of magnesium salts in preventing exercise-induced muscle cramps.",Yes
Does taking magnesium salts reduce the frequency and intensity of muscle cramps in pregnancy?,No,"The efficacy of magnesium supplementation in reducing the frequency and intensity of leg cramps during pregnancy has been evaluated in various studies, including randomized and quasi-randomized trials. These studies have shown that oral magnesium supplementation did not reduce the occurrence and frequency of episodes of leg cramps in pregnant women. Additionally, the use of magnesium sulfate infusion in cases of uterine hyperstimulation has been assessed, demonstrating its ability to decrease the frequency of uterine contractions while maintaining the amplitude. However, the evidence does not support the use of magnesium supplementation for reducing muscle cramps in pregnancy. Therefore, it is concluded that taking magnesium salts does not reduce the frequency and intensity of muscle cramps in pregnancy.",Yes
Does the active ingredient rivaroxaban (drug Xarelto) have a higher risk of dangerous bleeding than other anticoagulants?,No,"Rivaroxaban (Xarelto) is a potent, selective direct inhibitor of factor Xa and is used in the prevention of venous thromboembolism in adult patients after total hip or knee replacement surgery. While it does carry a risk of bleeding, including major bleeding and intracranial hemorrhage, it is not associated with an increased risk of fatal bleeding compared to placebo. Additionally, the overall risk of major or clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding with rivaroxaban is not significantly different from that of other anticoagulants. However, it is important to note that rivaroxaban may have a different risk profile for bleeding, with a potentially higher risk of gastrointestinal bleeding or abnormal uterine bleeding compared to other anticoagulants. Despite this, rivaroxaban is considered a safe and effective alternative to warfarin and other anticoagulants.",Yes
Does vitamin D protect against dementia or memory loss?,Yes,", with caveats.

Evidence from numerous studies suggests that vitamin D plays a role in maintaining cognitive function in old age and may have neuroprotective effects. Low vitamin D concentrations have been linked to an increased risk of dementia, and emerging evidence suggests that low vitamin D levels may be involved in the pathogenesis of dementia. Higher vitamin D status has been associated with reduced problems memorizing new information in older adults. However, results from longitudinal studies examining the association of vitamin D with incident dementia and cognitive impairment have been inconsistent. Restoring vitamin D levels may represent a useful strategy for healthy brain aging, but whether vitamin D concentrations are a useful indicator for the identification and clinical management of dementia remains to be determined.",NEI
Does brain training boost intelligence?,NEI,"The effectiveness of cognitive training, often referred to as ""brain training,"" in boosting intelligence remains a controversial topic. While cognitive training has been shown to improve performance on specific tasks, the extent to which these improvements transfer to other cognitive domains or lead to general increases in intelligence is not fully understood. Some studies suggest that cognitive training can be an effective tool for enhancing cognitive functions, and a small number of studies have shown that brain stimulation accompanying training protocols can enhance their effects. However, other research has called into question the benefit of cognitive training beyond practice effects. The role of individual differences in brain function and training performance further complicates the issue. Therefore, it is not possible to definitively state that brain training boosts intelligence based on the available information. Further research is needed to determine the specific training regimens, conditions, and individual factors that may lead to the best transfer effects and general cognitive enhancement.",Yes
Does petroleum help against cancer?,No,"Justification: The context indicates that petroleum and its derivatives have been the subject of extensive research due to their widespread use in various industries and potential health implications. Specifically, the focus on petroleum workers exposed to benzene, a known carcinogen, has been investigated for its potential link to non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). However, the results from individual studies and pooled analyses suggest that petroleum workers were not at an increased risk of NHL as a result of their exposure to benzene or other benzene-containing petroleum products. Furthermore, the context highlights the high toxicity and recalcitrant properties of petroleum hydrocarbons, which are known to have significant environmental impacts. Therefore, it can be concluded that petroleum does not help against cancer, and in fact, its toxicity and potential carcinogenic properties are of concern.",Yes
Does lavender scent help with sleep disorders?,Yes,"Lavender scent has been shown to improve sleep quality and promote deep or slow-wave sleep in both men and women. The combination of lavender aromatherapy and sleep hygiene practices has been found to be more effective than sleep hygiene alone in enhancing sleep quantity and quality. This effect has been observed in various clinical settings, including intermediate care units, and has been sustained at a two-week follow-up. Lavender also increases stage 2 (light) sleep and decreases rapid-eye movement (REM) sleep and wake after sleep onset latency in women, with opposite effects in men. The mechanism of action is not fully understood, but it is hypothesized that lavender may regulate key targets such as adrb1 and hla-drb1. Additionally, lavender aromatherapy has been shown to increase blood melatonin levels, which is a hormone that regulates sleep-wake cycles. Therefore, it can be concluded that lavender scent is a promising intervention for improving sleep disorders.",NEI
Does the drug Sovaldi (sofosbuvir) enable high cure rates for chronic hepatitis C?,Yes,"Sofosbuvir, the active ingredient in Sovaldi, has demonstrated high cure rates for chronic hepatitis C in clinical studies. The drug has shown high antiviral activity across all genotypes of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) and has achieved excellent efficacy and safety in the treatment of chronic hepatitis C. The US Food and Drug Administration approved sofosbuvir for the treatment of chronic HCV infection in December 2013, and the European Medicines Agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use has also recommended its approval. Sofosbuvir-based treatment regimens have achieved high sustained virologic response (SVR) rates in real-life cohorts of patients with chronic HCV infection, including those with cirrhosis. The drug has been generally well-tolerated in patients with chronic hepatitis C, with adverse events and laboratory abnormalities consistent with those expected with ribavirin and peginterferon-α.",NEI
Does alpha lipoic acid help prevent or treat Alzheimer's disease?,NEI,"The context suggests that alpha-lipoic acid has been reported to prevent and reverse age-related impairments in learning and memory, and it has been investigated as a potential supplement to moderate oxidative neuronal damage in Alzheimer's disease patients. However, the mechanism by which alpha-lipoic acid improves cognitive function remains unclear. The context also mentions that several independent studies have shown that poorly lipidated apoe increases amyloid burden in mouse models of AD, and this finding may provide some information regarding the mechanism of action of alpha-lipoic acid in the central nervous system. However, the context does not provide enough information to definitively conclude that alpha-lipoic acid helps prevent or treat Alzheimer's disease. Further research is needed to fully understand the potential benefits and mechanisms of action of alpha-lipoic acid in the context of Alzheimer's disease.",Yes
Are Vemma products good for health?,NEI,"The health benefits of Vemma products cannot be definitively determined due to insufficient information. The context does not provide data on the nutritional content or health impact of Vemma products. However, it does highlight the importance of offering healthier food options in vending machines and the potential benefits of increasing the proportion of nutritious products. The context also emphasizes the significance of consuming vegetables and fruits for their nutrient and non-nutrient substances, which contribute to overall health. In the absence of specific information about Vemma products, it is not possible to make a conclusive statement about their health benefits.",Yes
Do over-the-counter cough medicines relieve cough symptoms?,No,"Justification: According to the available data, over-the-counter (OTC) cough medicines, including mucolytics and cough suppressants, have not been proven effective in relieving cough symptoms in children. This conclusion is based on multiple randomized controlled trials comparing OTC cough preparations with placebo in both children and adults suffering from acute cough. The trials found that antihistamines, antitussives, antihistamine-decongestants, and antitussive/bronchodilator combinations were no more effective than placebo in relieving cough symptoms. Additionally, there is a growing concern about the potential risks and abuse of these medications, as well as their potential toxicity. Therefore, it is essential for healthcare providers to weigh the benefits against the potential risks when recommending OTC cough medicines and to educate patients about the expected natural course of their illness.",Yes
Does a diet rich in vitamin K2 protect against diseases of the cardiovascular system?,Yes,"Evidence suggests that a high dietary intake of vitamin K2 is associated with a decreased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Vitamin K2 plays a role in preventing vascular calcification, a process linked to CVD. In addition, recent studies have found an inverse association between vitamin K2 intake and the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD). While the results are not entirely consistent, the overall trend supports the notion that a diet rich in vitamin K2 may have protective effects against CVD. However, more research is needed to fully understand the relationship between vitamin K2 and CVD.",No
Can shoe insoles relieve pain in people with high arches?,Yes,"The use of therapeutic footwear with specially-made insoles is a common practice in managing various foot-related conditions, including those associated with high arches. Insoles can be molded to the shape of the foot, providing support during physical activity and helping to stabilize the foot. They have been shown to improve conditions such as plantar heel pain, likely due to their ability to raise the medial longitudinal arch of the foot and lower stress on the plantar tissues. Furthermore, dynamic impression insoles have been found to effectively relieve metatarsal pain due to a larger weight-bearing area. While routine use of orthotic insoles may not prevent physical-stress-related lower limb injuries in healthy young male adults, they are safe and less costly than knee bracing if they relieve pain or improve function. Therefore, it can be inferred that shoe insoles can potentially relieve pain in people with high arches.",Yes
Can shoe insoles relieve pain in people with foot deformities other than high arch?,Yes,"Evidence suggests that shoe insoles can indeed relieve pain in individuals with foot deformities other than high arches. In particular, therapeutic footwear with specially-made insoles is often used to alleviate pain and ulcer risks in patients with diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis, which may be caused by high pressures from areas beneath bony prominences of the foot. Furthermore, dynamic impression insoles have been shown to effectively relieve metatarsal pain due to a larger weight-bearing area, and custom molded insoles with metatarsal supports are used to redistribute excessive loading under the metatarsal heads in patients with metatarsalgia. Additionally, orthoses can help alleviate pain stemming from abnormal foot biomechanics, such as overpronation or rigid pes cavus. These findings provide support for the use of simple insoles to control for excessive foot pronation during walking and improve conditions such as plantar heel pain (fasciitis) by raising the medial longitudinal arch of the foot and lowering stress on plantar tissues.",Yes
Can dowsers find harmful soil zones or water veins?,No,"Justification: The context provided does not offer any scientific evidence supporting the ability of dowsers to find harmful soil zones or water veins. The scientific literature suggests that dowsing, or water witching, is not a reliable method for detecting groundwater sources or contaminants. Instead, the context emphasizes the importance of using scientific methods, such as detailed field surveys, water residue analyses, and soil testing, to determine soil and water quality. These methods are based on empirical evidence and are widely accepted in the scientific community. Therefore, it is not scientifically accurate to claim that dowsers can find harmful soil zones or water veins.",Yes
Does bioresonance therapy help with health complaints?,NEI,"The context provided discusses the efficacy of biofeedback therapy in treating various health conditions, but does not mention bioresonance therapy. Biofeedback and bioresonance are two distinct therapeutic approaches. Biofeedback involves training individuals to control their physiological processes through the use of electronic monitoring devices, while bioresonance therapy is based on the concept of using electromagnetic waves to diagnose and treat health conditions. Therefore, it is not possible to draw conclusions about the effectiveness of bioresonance therapy based on the information provided about biofeedback therapy. Further research is needed to determine the efficacy of bioresonance therapy in treating health complaints.",Yes
Do irradiations with cold red light help with chronic gingivitis?,Yes,"Recent studies have demonstrated the potential of adjunctive treatment procedures, including laser irradiation, in the management of chronic periodontitis. Low-level laser therapy, as an adjunct to nonsurgical treatment, has been shown to be beneficial on a short-term basis. Furthermore, the application of laser as a monotherapy has been shown to reduce probing pocket depths and increase clinical attachment levels in patients with chronic periodontitis. The efficacy of stabilized stannous fluoride toothpaste, CPC rinses, and O-R electric toothbrushes in improving gingival health has also been demonstrated in both shorter-term treatment and longer-term prevention models. However, further studies are required to assess the long-term effectiveness of these adjunctive treatments. In summary, the use of cold red light irradiation as an adjunctive treatment for chronic gingivitis has been shown to be beneficial in recent studies.",Yes
Does the Aspire system help you lose weight?,Yes,"The Aspire system, also known as the AspireAssist system, has been shown to be an effective weight loss therapy in individuals with Class II and III obesity. This endoscopic weight loss device allows patients to remove up to one-third of the calories consumed during a meal, leading to a reduction in overall caloric intake. In a clinical study, subjects who used the Aspire system in conjunction with lifestyle counseling lost an average of 18.6% ± 2.3% of their body weight after one year, compared to 5.9% ± 5.0% in the lifestyle counseling alone group. Furthermore, a total of 58.6% of participants in the AspireAssist group lost at least 25% of their excess body weight, compared to 15.3% in the lifestyle counseling group. These findings suggest that the Aspire system is a safe and effective weight loss therapy that can lead to significant reductions in body weight and improvements in quality of life.",Yes
Can FLEXISEQ ointment relieve osteoarthritis pain?,NEI,"The context provided does not mention FLEXISEQ ointment; therefore, it is not possible to determine whether FLEXISEQ ointment can relieve osteoarthritis pain based solely on the given information. However, the context does suggest that various treatments, such as joint lavage, topical diclofenac diethylamine gel, intravenous lignocaine, and heat application, have shown effectiveness in managing osteoarthritis symptoms, including pain. Further research on FLEXISEQ ointment would be required to establish its efficacy in relieving osteoarthritis pain.",Yes
Can butterbur prevent migraine attacks?,Yes,"Evidence suggests that butterbur, specifically a special root extract, has shown potential as an effective and well-tolerated migraine prophylaxis for both adults and children. Two randomized and placebo-controlled trials with a total of 289 migraine patients have demonstrated the efficacy and safety of this special butterbur root extract in reducing migraine attacks in adults. Furthermore, an open prospective migraine prevention study in children and adolescents has shown similar results and a low rate of adverse events, indicating that butterbur root extract may also be effective for migraine prevention in younger populations. The mechanism of action for butterbur's anti-migraine properties is thought to be related to its attenuation of pain and neurogenic inflammation.",Yes
Does bisphenol A trigger allergies?,Yes,"Bisphenol A (BPA) has been linked with allergic airway inflammation in animal models and is suspected of inducing oxidative stress in humans, which may contribute to adverse health outcomes. BPA exposure has been shown to promote splenomegaly, pro-inflammatory activation, and morphological alterations in immune cells, as well as induce lipidome perturbation. These findings suggest that BPA may trigger allergic responses through its effects on immune cells and inflammation. However, further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms underlying BPA-induced allergies and to determine the extent of its impact on human health.",NEI
Can maggots accelerate the healing of chronic wounds compared to conventional treatment?,Yes,"Justification: Maggot therapy has been shown to be an effective method for treating chronic wounds, particularly those that have failed to respond to conventional treatments. Maggots promote wound healing through their excretions and secretions, which remove necrotic tissue, counter bacterial infection, and activate wound-associated cells. Maggot therapy has three core beneficial effects on a wound: debridement, disinfection, and enhanced healing. Studies have indicated that maggot therapy can lead to faster wound debridement, granulation tissue development, and wound surface area reduction. The use of maggot therapy is experiencing a revival in the treatment of problem wounds, and there is renewed interest in its use for the healing of chronic wounds. Therefore, it can be concluded that maggots can accelerate the healing of chronic wounds compared to conventional treatment.",No
Do electric toothbrushes protect oral health better than manual brushes?,Yes,"Evidence from multiple studies suggests that electric toothbrushes are more effective than manual brushes in maintaining oral health. Electric toothbrushes have been found to be significantly more efficient in removing plaque and improving gingival health, particularly in subjects unfamiliar with electric brushes. Powered toothbrushes have demonstrated better plaque removal, lower plaque index, and reduced gingival and bleeding index compared to manual toothbrushes. Furthermore, electric toothbrushes have been shown to control dental plaque more effectively than manual brushing alone, and their use has been associated with a higher percentage of healthy dentitions in children. However, it is important to note that the efficacy of electric toothbrushes may vary depending on the type and design of the brush, and the oscillating-rotating type has shown no significant difference in gingivitis reduction compared to manual toothbrushes. Nonetheless, overall, electric toothbrushes are considered an effective tool for maintaining oral health and are more effective than manual brushes in reducing dental plaque, gingivitis, and bleeding.",NEI
Do antidepressants from the group of serotonin reuptake inhibitors help with depression?,Yes,"Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) are a group of antidepressants widely prescribed and regarded as a first-line treatment for depression. They function by increasing extracellular serotonin levels in the brain by blocking its uptake via the high-affinity serotonin transporter (SERT). This mechanism is thought to contribute to their antidepressant effects. SSRIs include medications such as citalopram, escitalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, and sertraline. While the exact relationship between the unique pharmacological properties of each SSRI and their antidepressant effects remains unclear, they are generally considered effective antidepressants. However, it is important to note that success is limited, and patients who do not benefit from SSRIs are often switched to non-selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor agents.",Yes
Is there a health risk from metal contaminants in lipsticks?,No,"Based on the available data, there appears to be no significant non-carcinogenic health risk due to the exposure of heavy metals (lead, cadmium, and chromium) through lipstick consumption for prolonged exposure of 35 years (hazard quotient < 1). The study aimed to determine the concentration of these metals in lipsticks of different price categories sold in the Malaysian market and evaluate the potential health risks due to daily ingestion of heavy metals in lipsticks. The heavy metal content of cosmetics may be a cause for concern, as exposure to these metals is associated with adverse consequences. However, the data suggests that the heavy metals present in cosmetics do not appear to pose a serious risk to health. It is important to note that cosmetics contaminated with heavy metals can lead to their accumulation in the skin, and the further migration of these toxic elements to blood vessels can cause subsequent difficulties. Therefore, constant monitoring is required to ensure the safety of consumers.",Yes
Can topiramate reduce the frequency of migraine attacks?,Yes,"Topiramate has been shown to significantly reduce migraine frequency in several studies. In one study, 70 episodic migraine patients who were administered topiramate as first-line therapy exhibited a decrease in mean migraine frequency from 5.8 to 1.9 per 28 days (p = 0.001). In another study, topiramate-treated patients experienced a significantly lower 28-day migraine frequency compared to placebo (3.31 ± 1.7 versus 3.83 ± 2.1; p =.002). The mean 28-day migraine frequency was reduced by 36% in patients receiving topiramate as compared with 14% in patients receiving placebo (p =.004). Topiramate has also been shown to be effective in reducing the frequency of both mild and moderate/severe migraine headaches. Therefore, it can be concluded that topiramate can reduce the frequency of migraine attacks.",Yes
Does particulate matter pollution increase the risk of heart attack - even if the EU limits are complied with?,Yes,"Scientific Explanation: Numerous epidemiological studies have demonstrated that exposure to particulate matter (PM) air pollution is causally linked to an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases and events. Long-term exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) has been associated with elevated risks of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, as well as increased incidence of ischemic heart disease (IHD). Furthermore, high concentrations of PM air pollution have been linked to hospital admissions and deaths due to cardiovascular morbidity. Although the exact mechanisms by which PM affects the heart remain uncertain, it is evident that PM is an important and modifiable environmental risk factor for cardiovascular health. Therefore, even if EU limits are complied with, particulate matter pollution can still increase the risk of heart attacks.",Yes
Are endocrine disruptors in cosmetics a health risk?,Yes,"Justification: Endocrine disruptors, such as phthalates, parabens, bisphenol A (BPA), and triclosan (TCS), are chemicals used in a wide variety of consumer products, including cosmetics and personal care products. These substances can interfere with hormone action in the body, leading to disrupted endocrine function and negatively affecting human health and development. In vitro and animal studies have reported endocrine-disrupting activity of these chemicals, and there is growing interest in the possible health threat posed by endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs). EDCs have been known to adversely affect the endocrine system, leading to compromised hormone functions, and they can also be carcinogenic, immunotoxic, and hepatotoxic to human skin. A significant proportion of users have suffered from cosmetics-related adverse events, often due to hypersensitivity reactions. Therefore, endocrine disruptors in cosmetics pose a health risk.",NEI
"Can a dietary supplement containing omega-3 fatty acids, lipids, vitamins, and nutrients (""Souvenaid"") noticeably slow or halt the decline of mental performance in Alzheimer's disease?",Yes,"Evidence suggests that a dietary supplement containing omega-3 fatty acids, such as Souvenaid, can potentially slow or halt the decline of mental performance in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Previous studies have shown that Souvenaid may have benefits on memory, cognition, and function in early AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Additionally, Souvenaid has been found to affect brain phospholipid metabolism in mild AD, which is in line with preclinical studies. Furthermore, Souvenaid has demonstrated a significant effect on several cognitive domains and on specific cognitive scales in patients with MCI-HR-AD. The effects of omega-3 fatty acids supplementation in mild AD also corroborate epidemiological observational studies showing that omega-3 fatty acids may be beneficial in disease onset when there is slight impairment of brain function. Regular consumption of food enriched in omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids has been shown to reduce the risk of cognitive decline in elderly individuals and possibly the development of AD. Overall, these findings suggest that Souvenaid may have a positive impact on cognitive function in individuals with AD.",NEI
Is it harmful to health to eat apple cores with the apple?,No,"Based on the available information, it is not harmful to health to eat apple cores with the apple. In fact, apple peels, which are a part of the apple core, contain high concentrations of phenolic compounds that may assist in the prevention of chronic diseases. These phenolic compounds have been shown to have a variety of biological activities that contribute to health beneficial effects against cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, obesity, and cancer. Moreover, apple peels should not be discarded from the diet, as they have strong antiproliferative effects against cancer cells. However, it is important to note that fresh apples can cause birch pollen-related food allergy in some populations, primarily due to the presence of mal d 1, the major apple allergen that is cross-reactive to the homologous and sensitizing allergen bet v 1 from birch. Therefore, individuals with known allergies to birch pollen should exercise caution when consuming apples, including the core.",No
Can taking selenium prevent cancer?,NEI,"The potential chemopreventive properties of selenium have been extensively studied, with evidence suggesting a protective role against various types of cancers, including lung, colorectal, and prostate cancers. Selenium supplementation has been shown to reduce the incidence of cancer in animal models and human clinical trials. The trace element is believed to exert its cancer-preventive effects by inducing apoptosis in human prostate cancer cells and reducing the frequency of DNA adducts and chromosome breaks, thus decreasing the likelihood of detrimental mutations that contribute to carcinogenesis. However, it is important to note that the molecular basis for selenium's chemopreventive effects remains unclear. Moreover, while epidemiological and clinical data suggest a reduced cancer incidence and mortality with higher selenium exposure, supplementation trials have not indicated a clear benefit. Therefore, there is currently insufficient evidence to definitively conclude that selenium supplementation can prevent cancer in men, women, or children.",No
Does mesotherapy help against pain?,Yes,"Mesotherapy has been shown to have a beneficial effect in reducing both acute and chronic musculoskeletal pain. This minimally invasive technique involves the direct injection of medications into the skin and underlying tissue to improve musculoskeletal, neurologic, and cosmetic conditions. The results of mesotherapy treatment have been encouraging for the resolution of acute and chronic musculoskeletal vertebral pain from one to five sessions. Furthermore, mesotherapy has been demonstrated to be effective for treating pain compared to no treatment and active comparators. However, it is important to note that there are reported systemic and local side effects of mesotherapy, and there are no definitive treatment protocols for this approach. Despite this, mesotherapy provides general practitioners with another tool for the treatment of local pain and can be included as an ancillary treatment in the management of localized pain in rehabilitation.",No
Do general health checkups lead to longer life?,NEI,"(Not Enough Information)

Based on the available information, it is not conclusive whether general health checkups lead to longer life. While there is evidence suggesting that additional appropriate clinical tests may improve the effectiveness of physical checkups and result in health benefits for elderly persons, there is also a lack of association between offers of health checks and lower rates of all-cause mortality, mortality from cardiovascular disease, or mortality from cancer compared with usual care. Furthermore, the general health check is not recommended to maintain the health of asymptomatic adults with no risk factors. It is also noted that there is little information to indicate whether frequent visits to the doctor's office or frequent testing improves survival or quality of life. Therefore, more research is needed to establish a definitive answer to this question.",No
Can dementia be prevented?,Yes,", with limitations.

Scientific justification: The potential for dementia prevention lies primarily in the modification of specific risk factors. According to extensive cohort studies, up to 35% of dementia cases could be prevented by addressing nine modifiable risk factors, including low education, midlife hearing loss, obesity, hypertension, late-life depression, smoking, physical inactivity, diabetes, and social isolation. Preventive measures for vascular dementia involve the management of vascular risk factors and similar strategies used to avert heart attacks and strokes. However, the evidence from large clinical trials is not conclusive to support that a third of dementia cases might be prevented. Therefore, while dementia prevention is desirable and achievable to some extent, further research is required to establish more definitive preventive measures and interventions.",No
Does the plant pigment beta-carotene protect against cancer?,Yes,", with caveats.

Beta-carotene, a plant pigment abundant in fruits and vegetables, has been suggested to have a protective role against cancer. This pigment, a potent quencher of singlet oxygen and free radicals, can inhibit the growth of various cancer cells, including colon adenocarcinoma cell lines. Beta-carotene's anticancer activity is thought to stem from its antioxidant properties, its ability to modulate cell growth pathways, and its potential to be converted to vitamin A. However, while epidemiological evidence indicates a reduced cancer risk with high dietary carotenoid intake, intervention trials have shown that beta-carotene supplementation in smokers can paradoxically increase lung cancer incidence and mortality. The exact mechanisms behind beta-carotene's anticancer effects and the reasons for its differential impact in smokers remain subjects of ongoing research.",No
Can vitamin supplements protect against life-threatening diseases such as cancer or cardiovascular disease?,NEI,"The role of antioxidant vitamins in preventing life-threatening diseases such as cancer and cardiovascular disease remains unclear. While observational studies suggest that high intake of antioxidant vitamins, either through regular diet or as food supplements, may lower the risk of myocardial infarction and stroke, randomized controlled trials have failed to demonstrate any beneficial effects in the primary prevention of these conditions. The evidence regarding the efficacy of vitamin supplementation in preventing cancer is also mixed, with some studies suggesting a possible role in the prevention of certain types of cancer, while others have failed to demonstrate any protective effects. Furthermore, high doses of vitamin supplements may have unknown and potentially toxic effects. Therefore, it is not possible to definitively state whether vitamin supplements can protect against life-threatening diseases such as cancer or cardiovascular disease.",No
Is it true that lowering cholesterol does not reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease?,No,"Justification: The claim that lowering cholesterol does not reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease is false. There is broad evidence that lowering low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol will reduce cardiovascular risk, and data indicate that aggressive cholesterol reduction decreases mortality and morbidity associated with coronary heart disease. The reduction of LDL-cholesterol has been associated with a decrease in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. However, it is uncertain whether pharmacological reductions in very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDLs) and their component triglyceride and cholesterol could reduce residual risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events among individuals in whom LDL-C has been adequately lowered. Additionally, several large studies recently revealed that pharmacologic interventions that increase HDL-C concentration have not improved cardiovascular outcomes when added to standard therapy. Nonetheless, the benefits of decreasing cholesterol to very low levels are not yet certain, although epidemiologic reviews strongly correlate lower cholesterol levels with lowered coronary artery disease mortality.",No
Do static magnets help against pain?,Yes,", with limitations.

Scientific evidence suggests that static magnets may help reduce pain and enhance functional movement when applied over painful knee joints. Systematic literature reviews have demonstrated a positive effect of static magnets in achieving analgesia across a broad range of different types of pain, including neuropathic, inflammatory, musculoskeletal, fibromyalgic, rheumatic, and postsurgical. However, the weight of evidence from well-conducted controlled trials suggests that static magnetic fields are able to induce analgesia, but the evidence does not support the use of static magnets for pain relief as an effective treatment. Therefore, it is important for consumers to approach magnet therapy with caution and consider other evidence-based treatments for pain management.",No
Does hypnosis help with chronic bowel problems?,Yes,"Hypnosis has been shown to be an effective intervention for the treatment of functional bowel disorders, particularly irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Gut-directed hypnotherapy is considered to be an effective treatment for IBS and has been reported to have beneficial effects for IBS symptoms. The therapeutic effect of hypnotherapy has been found to be superior to that of a waiting list control or usual medical management for abdominal pain and composite primary IBS symptoms in the short term for patients who fail standard medical therapy. Additionally, gut-directed hypnotherapy has durable efficacy in patients with IBS and possibly ulcerative colitis. Although the mechanism of action is unknown, hypnosis improves IBS symptoms through reductions in psychological distress and somatization. While there are some methodologic inadequacies in the studies, all studies show that hypnotherapy is highly effective for patients with refractory IBS.",Yes
Does taking vitamin D supplements during pregnancy increase the risk of food allergy for the unborn child?,No,"Evidence suggests that maternal vitamin D intake during pregnancy may have beneficial effects on allergic outcomes in offspring. Reduced vitamin D status in pregnancy has been identified as a potential risk factor for the development of allergic outcomes, including food allergies, in children. However, sufficient vitamin D status at birth and early infancy oral vitamin D supplementation does not appear to reduce the development of early childhood allergic disease in ""allergy high-risk"" infants. Furthermore, excess vitamin A intake during pregnancy was associated with increased risk, whereas vitamin D intake close to recommendations was associated with a reduced risk of asthma in school-age children. The combined role of prenatal and postnatal vitamin D status in the development of food sensitization and food allergy remains understudied, but current evidence does not suggest that taking vitamin D supplements during pregnancy increases the risk of food allergy for the unborn child.",NEI
Is combined hormone therapy with estrogen and progestin safe for women in late menopause (after the last menstrual period)?,Yes,", with caveats.

Combined hormone therapy with estrogen and progestin can be safe for women in late menopause, provided it is used judiciously. The therapy is effective in managing menopausal symptoms and preventing postmenopausal osteoporosis. However, safety and tolerability concerns exist. The increased risk of endometrial cancer associated with estrogen therapy can be mitigated by adding progestin. In fact, the risk of endometrial cancer can be reduced to less than that observed in untreated postmenopausal women. However, prolonged use of sequential hormone replacement therapy with estrogen and progestogen for 10 to 24 days per month may elevate endometrial cancer risk relative to those who have never received hormone replacement therapy. Therefore, the benefits and risks of hormone therapy should be carefully evaluated for each individual woman, particularly those considering long-term therapy for disease prevention or life prolongation.",No
Can negative expectancy reduce the effect of pain medications?,Yes,"Research has shown that expectancy plays a significant role in the effectiveness of pain treatments. Negative expectancy, characterized by pessimistic or unrealistic expectations about treatment outcomes, can reduce the effect of pain medications. This is primarily due to the nocebo effect, where negative expectations lead to an increase in perceived side effects and a decrease in treatment adherence. Negative emotions, which are often associated with negative expectancy, have been shown to increase pain perception. Conversely, interventions aimed at changing patients' expectations, such as providing enhanced information and optimizing patient-physician communication, have been found to have a small but significant effect on pain experience. Therefore, it can be concluded that negative expectancy can indeed reduce the effect of pain medications.",No
Is sex as good an endurance workout as running?,No,"Justification: The context does not support the claim that sex is as effective an endurance workout as running. Instead, it provides evidence that sex and exercise intensity influence the flow-mediated dilation (FMD) response to acute aerobic exercise in older adults. The context also suggests that women have greater muscular endurance than men, particularly in low to moderate intensity exercises, and are less fatigable in single-joint exercises. However, there is no direct comparison between sex and running as endurance workouts. Additionally, the context indicates that men and women have different metabolic responses to running, which may impact their endurance performance. Therefore, based on the context, it is not accurate to claim that sex is as good an endurance workout as running.",No
Can electrical brain stimulation reduce the amount of food eaten?,Yes,"Accumulating evidence suggests that both non-invasive and invasive brain stimulation techniques have the potential to reduce food cravings and calorie consumption, thereby rendering them potential treatment options for obesity. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) has been shown to decrease craving for food and reduce appetite and caloric intake. This is achieved by modifying cortical excitability and enhancing inhibitory control, which may facilitate improved control of eating. Furthermore, acute neuromodulation of the prefrontal cortex with tDCS has been shown to decrease food craving, attentional bias to food, and actual food intake. Additionally, long-term electrical vagus nerve stimulation (VNS), which mimics satiety signals from the gut, may cause a reduction in body mass and decrease in food intake. However, while tDCS has been used to suppress food cravings, there is insufficient evidence to support its application in clinical practice at present.",NEI
Are plastic kitchen boards more hygienic than wooden ones?,No,"Justification: The study indicates that the use of plastic cutting boards in home kitchens is not necessarily more hygienic than the use of wooden cutting boards. In fact, the results suggest that wood surfaces can absorb moisture and contaminating bacteria, making them potentially less desirable from a food safety perspective. However, fewer bacteria were generally recovered from wooden blocks than from plastic blocks, and the study found that brief ""cooking"" of wooden boards in a microwave oven is an effective way to kill bacteria. Additionally, the study found that new plastic cutting surfaces were relatively easy to clean and were microbiologically neutral, but plastic boards with extensive knife scars were difficult to clean manually, especially if they had deposits of chicken fat on them. Therefore, based on the information provided, it cannot be concluded that plastic kitchen boards are more hygienic than wooden ones.",NEI
Does excessive beer or alcohol consumption lead to obesity?,Yes,"Excessive alcohol consumption, including binge drinking, has been identified as a common cause of fatty liver disease. Additionally, heavy and regular alcohol consumption has been positively correlated with increasing body weight. While it is unclear whether this weight gain is due to alcohol consumption per se or to additional energy intake from food, alcohol intake has been associated with overeating in humans. The experimental metabolic evidence suggests that moderate amounts of alcohol can contribute to a positive energy balance and thus weight gain. Furthermore, adults do not appear to compensate appropriately for alcohol energy by eating less, and a relatively modest alcohol dose may lead to an increase in food consumption. Therefore, excessive beer or alcohol consumption can lead to obesity.",NEI
Do omega-3 fatty acids or a diet rich in fish help with rheumatoid arthritis?,Yes,"The consumption of omega-3 fatty acids, particularly eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), found in oily fish and fish oil supplements, has been shown to have beneficial effects in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials have demonstrated that dietary n-3 fats, supplied as fish oil, can improve clinical parameters of disease activity, including the number of tender joints, and reduce levels of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), a pro-inflammatory cytokine. Although the mechanism of their anti-inflammatory effect remains to be fully elucidated, it is known that EPA and DHA interfere with the body's inflammatory response, making them of potential use in the treatment of RA. Furthermore, epidemiological studies suggest that a diet high in marine fatty acids may have preventive and therapeutic effects in RA, and that intake of oily fish is associated with a modestly decreased risk of developing RA. Therefore, it is concluded that omega-3 fatty acids or a diet rich in fish can help with rheumatoid arthritis.",NEI
Does unprocessed red meat increase the risk of cardiovascular disease?,NEI,"(Not Enough Information)

     The relationship between unprocessed red meat consumption and the risk of cardiovascular disease remains uncertain. While some epidemiological research has associated red meat intake with an increased risk of coronary heart disease and type 2 diabetes, it is not clear whether these associations are causally related to unprocessed lean red meat. The high processed red meat consumption is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease, but evidence is limited for unprocessed red meat. In meta-analyses of prospective cohorts, a smaller increase or no risk is seen with unprocessed meat consumption. However, the overall findings suggest that neither unprocessed red nor processed meat consumption is beneficial for cardiometabolic health, and that clinical and public health guidance should especially prioritize reducing processed meat consumption.",NEI
"Does processed red meat (sausages, ham, bacon) increase the risk of cardiovascular disease???",Yes,"Numerous studies have demonstrated a potential association between processed red meat consumption and an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). The high sodium content in processed red meat, such as sausages, ham, and bacon, could contribute to this increased risk by elevating blood pressure. Additionally, processed red meat is high in cholesterol, saturated and solid fatty acids, which are known to be detrimental to cardiovascular health. The risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) is also seen to be higher with processed meat consumption compared to unprocessed meat. Furthermore, the presence of specific harmful components, such as trimethylamine-n-oxide (TMAO), generated by gut microbial metabolism of red meat, may also contribute to the increased risk of CVD. The overall findings suggest that processed red meat consumption is not beneficial for cardiometabolic health, and clinical and public health guidance should prioritize reducing processed meat consumption.",Yes
Does hawthorn extract help patients with heart muscle weakness (heart failure)?,Yes,"Hawthorn extract, a popular herbal medicine, has been used for centuries to treat cardiovascular diseases, including heart failure. Recent trials have demonstrated its efficacy in treating heart failure, and it is currently being evaluated as an adjunctive treatment. The flavonoid components of hawthorn may be responsible for its beneficial effects in treating heart failure. Hawthorn extract has been shown to modify left ventricular remodeling and counteract myocardial dysfunction in early pressure overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy. Additionally, hawthorn extract appears to be anti-arrhythmic and capable of inducing rhythmicity in quiescent cardiomyocytes. While the exact mechanism by which hawthorn extract treats heart failure is unknown, it may include immunological effects or other mechanisms. Overall, hawthorn extract has been shown to be effective in treating heart failure and may be a useful complementary and alternative medicine for patients with heart muscle weakness.",NEI
Is glyphosate carcinogenic?,Yes,", with reservations

Glyphosate, a widely used herbicide, has been classified as a Group 2A substance, ""probably carcinogenic to humans,"" by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). This classification is supported by evidence from carcinogenicity studies that have revealed tumor promoting activity in glyphosate. The strongest evidence shows that glyphosate causes various types of tumors in mice and rats. However, it is important to note that the European Chemicals Agency has concluded that glyphosate is not proven to be carcinogenic, mutagenic, or to have negative effects on reproduction. Therefore, while there is evidence to suggest that glyphosate may be carcinogenic, further research is needed to fully understand its potential risks to human health.",NEI
Does psychotherapy help with burnout?,Yes,"Justification: The context indicates that psychotherapists commonly experience burnout, which is characterized by emotional exhaustion, among other symptoms. Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) is specifically mentioned as being helpful for addressing the emotional exhaustion component of burnout. Furthermore, the findings of the study suggest that therapy programs may have beneficial effects on symptomatology and neuroplasticity in patients with burnout. Counseling and coaching are also recommended for those experiencing burnout without significant depression. The overall evidence from the context suggests that psychotherapy, including CBT, can be helpful in addressing burnout.",Yes
Is electrical muscle stimulation (EMS) in combination with ordinary fitness training more efficient than fitness training alone?,Yes,"Electrical muscle stimulation (EMS) in combination with ordinary fitness training can be considered more efficient than fitness training alone. EMS has been shown to effectively improve muscle strength, functional performance, and counteract muscle fiber atrophy. Studies have confirmed that EMS can increase muscle mass by around 1% and improve muscle function by around 10-15% after 5-6 weeks of treatment. Furthermore, EMS concurrent with isometric exercise has been found to be more effective in improving quadriceps strength than no training, although it was not more effective than isometric exercise alone. Additionally, the combination of EMS and voluntary low-intensity exercise can induce both anaerobic and aerobic energy consumption, potentially making this type of exercise more efficient and effective than conventional exercise regimens. However, it is important to note that EMS should not be regarded as a replacement for exercise training per se, as the beneficial effects of exercise extend beyond muscle mass and strength.",NEI
Can vitamin and nutrient supplements prevent the eye disease age-related macular degeneration?,Yes,"Scientific Explanation: Research suggests that antioxidant vitamin and/or mineral supplementation may have beneficial effects on the progression of age-related macular degeneration (AMD). The Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) demonstrated that oral supplementation with antioxidant vitamins and minerals, such as vitamins C and E, beta-carotene, and zinc, reduced the risk of progression to advanced AMD in persons with at least intermediate AMD. Randomized trials comparing antioxidant vitamin and/or mineral supplements to control in people with AMD have shown modest benefits in halting the progression of the disease. However, it is important to note that these findings are dominated by one large trial in a relatively well-nourished American population, and further research is needed to determine the effectiveness of antioxidant supplementation in preventing or slowing the progression of AMD in other populations. Additionally, a relationship between these nutrients and other eye disorders, such as diabetic retinopathy, has yet to be defined.",No
Can they delay the progression of eye disease?,Yes,"Justification: The context suggests that progressive and degenerative eye conditions, such as cataract, glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration (AMD), and diabetic retinopathy (DR), can respond to natural therapeutic interventions that result in the arrest and/or improvement of morbidity, with enhanced functional results. The use of antioxidants, anti-inflammatory drugs, and lowering intraocular pressure (IOP) can delay the progression of these conditions. Furthermore, early detection, prevention, and monitoring of these manifestations can significantly benefit morbidity associated with such disease states, including permanent visual dysfunction. Recent gene therapy progress has also raised the possibility that vision loss caused by inherited retinal degeneration can be slowed or prevented. Therefore, it can be concluded that natural therapeutic interventions can delay the progression of eye disease.",Yes
Do milk or dairy products promote colon cancer and rectal cancer?,No,"Justification: The evidence from prospective studies and epidemiological data indicates an inverse association between milk and dairy product consumption and the risk of colorectal cancer. Specifically, there may be a weak inverse association between milk intake and risk of colon cancer among women. The findings support a protective role of milk consumption on colorectal cancer risk. However, it is important to note that high intakes of lactose and dairy products, particularly milk, are associated with an increased risk of serous ovarian cancer but not of other subtypes of ovarian cancer. The present study does not support an overall substantial effect of milk consumption on the risk of prostate, breast, colon, and rectal cancers at the population level. Therefore, it can be concluded that milk and dairy products do not promote colon cancer and rectal cancer.",No
Does yoga change the genetic makeup?,Yes,"Evidence suggests that yoga may indeed induce changes in genetic expression. The practice of yoga has been shown to result in rapid gene expression alterations, which may be the basis for its longer-term cell biological and higher-level health effects. Specifically, a study investigating the effects of yoga on memory and psychophysiological parameters related to stress found possible rapid changes in global gene expression profiles in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of healthy individuals who practiced a comprehensive yoga program. These findings suggest that yoga may have the potential to influence genetic expression, contributing to its various health benefits. However, further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms by which yoga brings about these effects.",NEI
Which of the three most common laser eye surgeries produces the best results and has the fewest side effects?,NEI,"The context does not provide a direct comparison between the three most common laser eye surgeries to determine which produces the best results and has the fewest side effects. However, it does mention three techniques for laser vision correction: small incision lenticule extraction, laser-assisted keratomileusis in situ, and photorefractive keratotomy. Additionally, the context discusses a study comparing the effects of microkeratome laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK), femtosecond laser in situ keratomileusis (FS-LASIK), and femtosecond small incision lenticule extraction (FS-SMILE) on 6-month postoperative stability of tear film. The results of this study could potentially provide insight into the relative effectiveness and side effects of these procedures, but the context does not explicitly state which procedure has the best results and fewest side effects.",Yes
"Can electromagnetic fields with a specific pattern (pulsed electromagnetic fields, PEMF) heal injuries?",Yes,"Pulsed Electromagnetic Field (PEMF) therapy has been demonstrated to facilitate healing processes in various types of injuries. PEMF devices exert biological effects by delivering electric and magnetic fields to tissues via inductive coils, promoting tissue repair and accelerating healing rates. This non-invasive therapy has been used clinically to treat surgically resistant fractures, nonunion fractures, and related problems in bone healing. The use of PEMF therapy has been found to be effective in promoting the healing of fracture nonunions and enhancing calcification of extracellular matrix. Furthermore, PEMF therapy has been shown to be beneficial for a wide variety of biological phenomena, including the stimulation of growth and repair of osteogenic tissues. The application of PEMF therapy has also been reported to enhance fracture and chronic wound healing, endothelial cell growth, and angiogenesis. Although the basis for the specificity of PEMF therapy is not fully understood, the substantial data indicate that exposure to electromagnetic fields can lead to enhanced healing in both soft and hard tissues.",NEI
Does the drug fingolimod reduce the progression of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis similarly or better than previous drugs?,Yes,"Fingolimod, a selective immunosuppressive agent, has demonstrated superior efficacy compared to interferon β-1a intramuscular in relapsing multiple sclerosis. It is a novel disease-modifying drug for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) and has been effective in reducing disease activity in RRMS patients requiring an escalation from first-line therapies. In phase 3 clinical trials, fingolimod showed significant reductions in both focal lesions and rate of brain volume loss (BVL) in patients with RRMS. The anti-inflammatory effects of fingolimod have been shown to slow disease progression in RRMS. Therefore, it can be concluded that fingolimod reduces the progression of RRMS similarly or better than previous drugs.",Yes
Can cancer be successfully fought with intentionally induced fever?,Yes,"Justification: The context suggests that elevated temperature, or hyperthermia, has been considered for cancer therapy since the end of the 19th century. Heat has been shown to have a beneficial effect on malignancies and can enhance the anti-cancer effects of radiation and chemotherapeutic agents. Additionally, hyperthermia per se has been shown to be effective in some cancers. The mechanism of action is thought to involve the modulation of the tumor immune microenvironment by providing danger signals with heat shock proteins and subsequent activation of immune systems. Therefore, it is plausible that cancer can be successfully fought with intentionally induced fever. However, it is important to note that the causes of intractable fever in cancer patients can be diverse and problematic, and a central origin should be considered when the fever is intractable.",NEI
Can some forms of headache be successfully treated with heat?,Yes,"The application of heat has been shown to be an effective treatment for certain types of headaches. High-level pulsed heat (45°C) has been found to produce significantly more analgesia compared to steady heat at 37°C for an extended period of time after treatment. Heat has also been recommended as a first-line therapy in many clinical guidelines for providing comfort and analgesia. Additionally, a randomized trial has evaluated the short-term efficacy of local heat on the pain caused by cervical osteoarthrosis. These findings suggest that heat can be a successful treatment option for some forms of headache.",NEI
Does electro-acupuncture on the ear help against pain?,Yes,"Electro-acupuncture on the ear has been shown to have potential benefits for pain management. Evidence suggests that both somatic and ear acupuncture have a positive effect in reducing pain. Specifically, auricular electroacupuncture (EA) has been found to relieve pain more effectively than conventional manual auricular acupuncture in chronic low back pain patients. Furthermore, patients receiving auricular acupuncture reported lower pain scores than those who did not, at various time intervals. Electrical stimulation of acupuncture points is considered to increase acupuncture analgesia, and electro-acupuncture can be effective in some pain conditions. However, it is important to note that study numbers are limited and substantial data on ear acupuncture are still lacking.",Yes
Does treatment with the new drug erenumab reduce the number of migraine days per month?,Yes,"The results from two pivotal trials in episodic and chronic migraine demonstrated that subcutaneous erenumab reduced monthly migraine days and increased the likelihood of achieving a ≥50% reduction at all monthly assessment points. Treatment with both doses of erenumab (70mg and 140mg) resulted in greater reductions in monthly migraine days compared to placebo, with treatment differences ranging from -0.9 to -4.3 days per month. The effect was consistent across subgroups, including those who had failed prior preventive treatments. These findings suggest that erenumab is an effective preventive treatment for migraines, reducing the number of migraine days per month.",Yes
Is screening by optical coherence tomography superior to conventional examinations for the early detection of diabetic macular edema?,Yes,"Justification: Optical coherence tomography (OCT) has been systematically reviewed for its sensitivity and specificity in diagnosing macular edema attributable to diabetic retinopathy. OCT has been found to perform well compared with conventional gold standard tests such as fundus stereophotography or contact and noncontact fundus biomicroscopy. The use of spectral-domain OCT (SD-OCT) in establishing a screening and treatment method for fovea-threatening diabetic macular edema (DME) has been evaluated. The Toronto Tele-Retinal Screening Program has also presented results on the benefit of OCT in combination with monoscopic color fundus photographs for DME detection. The early detection of DME is important for improving patient outcomes, and OCT has been shown to contribute to this early diagnosis and blindness prevention. OCT angiography (OCT-A) has recently improved the ability to detect subclinical and early clinically visible microvascular changes in patients with diabetes mellitus. These findings suggest that screening by OCT may be superior to conventional examinations for the early detection of diabetic macular edema.",No
Does the treatment of diabetes-related retinal diseases by injection of VEGF inhibitors provide an advantage compared to conventional laser treatment?,Yes,"The treatment of diabetes-related retinal diseases by injection of VEGF inhibitors provides an advantage compared to conventional laser treatment. Over a decade of clinical evidence has shown that intravitreal injection of anti-VEGF agents is associated with decreased disease progression and preservation of vision. These agents have become the gold standard treatment for diabetic retinopathy and have shown significant improvement in visual acuity. In addition, intravitreal anti-VEGF treatment with ranibizumab may also lead to a significant stabilization or even improvement of diabetic retinopathy. Although laser therapy remains the standard treatment for diabetic patients with significantly reduced visual acuity due to macular edema, the use of anti-VEGF agents has been found to be beneficial in proliferative diabetic retinopathy, especially in cases with neovascular glaucoma, persistent vitreous hemorrhage, and before vitrectomy. However, it is important to note that each intravitreal injection of these agents carries a small risk of endophthalmitis, which can be visually devastating.",Yes
Do saw palmetto preparations help with benign prostate enlargement?,Yes,"Saw palmetto, a phytotherapeutic agent, is widely recognized for its use in treating benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Its effectiveness has been demonstrated through multiple studies, which have shown that saw palmetto can reduce symptoms associated with BPH. This botanical agent is the most popular herbal supplement used for treating BPH, and its extracts are commonly used in traditional medicine for this purpose.

Although recent clinical trials have questioned the efficacy of saw palmetto at standard doses (320 mg/d), numerous placebo-controlled trials and meta-analyses have suggested that saw palmetto leads to both subjective and objective improvement in men with lower urinary tract symptoms associated with BPH. The use of saw palmetto in men with BPH is considered safe, with no recognized adverse effects.

The Saw Palmetto for Treatment of Enlarged Prostates (STEP) study, a randomized clinical trial, further supports the efficacy of saw palmetto in treating BPH. This trial compared a standardized extract of the saw palmetto berry (160 mg twice daily) with a placebo over a 1-year period in 225 men with moderate-to-severe symptoms of BPH. The results indicated that saw palmetto extract inhibited contractions of the rat prostate gland, consistent with smooth muscle relaxant activity.

In conclusion, the available evidence supports the use of saw palmetto preparations for the treatment of benign prostate enlargement.",No
"Do plant extracts of African plum tree, beta-sitosterol or ryegrass pollen extract (Cernilton) help benign prostate enlargement?",Yes,"The available data from clinical trials suggest that certain botanicals, including pygeum africanum (African plum tree), beta-sitosterol, and secale cereale (ryegrass pollen extract, Cernilton), can help in managing lower urinary tract symptoms secondary to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). These botanicals have been traditionally used in medicine and contain phytochemical compounds that have shown effectiveness in treating BPH. A combination of natural products, including Cernilton, saw palmetto, beta-sitosterol, and vitamin E, has been found to significantly lessen nocturia and frequency and diminish overall symptomatology of BPH. Additionally, Cernilton formulas have been shown to reduce androgen receptor and prostate-specific antigen protein expression in stromal cells. Thus, it can be concluded that these plant extracts have potential benefits in managing benign prostate enlargement.",NEI
Does not wearing bras provide medical benefits?,No,"The context suggests that wearing well-fitted bras can provide medical benefits, particularly for women with breast cancer. A significant percentage of women reported experiencing bra discomfort during exercise, and the majority were found to be wearing ill-fitting bras. This discomfort can serve as a barrier to physical activity, which is crucial for maintaining overall health. Furthermore, ill-fitting bras can lead to the development of musculoskeletal pain. Therefore, based on the information provided, not wearing bras does not seem to offer any medical benefits. Instead, it is the wearing of well-fitted bras that can contribute to improved health outcomes.",NEI
Are there medical benefits to wearing a bra?,Yes,"Justification: The context suggests that appropriate sports bras are crucial to limit potential breast pain and ptosis, which is the medical term for breast sagging. The study found that a sports bra designed to both elevate and compress the breasts significantly reduced exercise-induced breast discomfort and bra fit discomfort experienced by women with large breasts relative to a standard encapsulation sports bra. Additionally, ill-fitting bras and insufficient breast support can lead to the development of musculoskeletal pain and inhibit women participating in physical activity. The study also found that the new style bra significantly reduced vertical breast displacement and acceleration more consistently than other bras, and exercise-induced breast discomfort and bra discomfort were significantly less for the experimental bra condition. These findings suggest that wearing a well-fitted and supportive bra can provide medical benefits such as reducing breast pain, preventing breast sagging, and improving physical activity performance.",NEI
"Can oral vein products containing herbal active ingredients such as rutosides, hidrosmin, diosmin, extracts of horse chestnut seed and pine bark, Centella asiatica or grape seed extract or the synthetic substances calcium dobesilate or aminaftone relieve symptoms such as itching, restless or swollen legs, pain and cramps in people suffering from varicose veins or chronic venous insufficiency?",NEI,"Justification: The context provided discusses the effectiveness of herbal formulations in the treatment of vaginitis and does not provide information on the use of oral vein products containing herbal active ingredients for the relief of symptoms associated with varicose veins or chronic venous insufficiency. Therefore, there is not enough information to determine whether such products can relieve symptoms such as itching, restless or swollen legs, pain and cramps in people suffering from these conditions. Further research is needed to establish the efficacy of these products for this purpose.",Yes
Do vein preparations for external use help with varicose veins or chronic venous insufficiency?,Yes,"Venotonic drugs, also known as venoactive drugs (VADs), are suggested to relieve symptoms of chronic venous insufficiency by decreasing capillary leakage and improving venous tone. These drugs are used to treat chronic venous disease (CVD) and may provide benefits to patients recovering from surgical or endovenous varicose vein procedures. The study investigated the use of VADs before, during, or after a surgical, endovenous, or sclerotherapy procedure for varicose veins. The objective of the study was to analyze whether compression stocking therapy in the human varicose vein wall may change the levels of biomarkers associated with vein insufficiency. Lower limb varicose veins are the main cause of chronic venous insufficiency and can be treated effectively with endovenous ablation procedures or minimally invasive open techniques. Therefore, it can be inferred that vein preparations for external use, such as VADs and compression stockings, may help with varicose veins or chronic venous insufficiency.",NEI
Do milk or dairy products promote bladder cancer?,No,"The scientific evidence suggests that there is no overall association between milk consumption and bladder cancer. Observational studies have shown that milk consumption is inversely associated with colorectal, bladder, and breast cancer risk, but positively associated with prostate cancer. However, total dairy intake was not significantly associated with risk of bladder cancer. Furthermore, there was no or limited evidence that milk consumption affects the risk of bladder, breast, and prostate cancer. The intake of milk or cheese was not associated with bladder cancer risk. Genetic studies have also shown no overall association of genetically predicted milk consumption with bladder cancer. Therefore, it can be concluded that milk or dairy products do not promote bladder cancer.",No
Do milk or dairy products promote prostate cancer?,Yes,"The scientific literature suggests a positive association between high consumption of milk and/or dairy products and an increased risk of prostate cancer. Epidemiological studies have reported this correlation, with some investigations indicating a dose-dependent increase in risk. The intake of calcium or related components found in dairy foods may contribute to this elevated risk. While the data is not entirely consistent, the overall trend indicates that high dairy product intake, particularly high-fat dairy and whole milk, can potentially increase the risk of developing prostate cancer, especially in its aggressive form.",Yes
Do green tea products provide effective and safe support for weight loss?,Yes,", with caveats.

Justification: Green tea products have been found to have beneficial effects in weight loss and management, attributed primarily to their polyphenols and polysaccharides content. These compounds have been shown to suppress body weight increase and fat accumulation. However, the efficacy of green tea products in weight loss may vary depending on factors such as ethnicity and habitual caffeine intake. Furthermore, while generally safe, there have been isolated cases of hepatotoxicity possibly linked to specific green tea extracts. Therefore, while green tea products can provide effective support for weight loss, their use should be considered in the context of individual health profiles and under medical supervision.",No
Can monk's pepper help with cycle disorders?,NEI,"Monk's pepper, scientifically known as Vitex agnus-castus, has been traditionally used for various health conditions, including menstrual disorders. However, based on the provided context, there is no specific information regarding the effects of monk's pepper on cycle disorders. The context primarily discusses the effects of peppermint, black pepper, and chili peppers on various physiological conditions, but it does not mention monk's pepper or its potential benefits for cycle disorders. Therefore, it is not possible to definitively state whether monk's pepper can help with cycle disorders based solely on the given context. Further research would be needed to provide a conclusive answer.",NEI
Does brisk walking lower mortality? Is some exercise better than none at all?,Yes,"Brisk walking has been associated with a lower mortality risk compared to slow walking, even when considering an otherwise unhealthy lifestyle. This is evident in the estimated 10-year survival rates, which were higher in brisk walkers who engaged in an unhealthy lifestyle compared to slow walkers who engaged in a healthy lifestyle: 97.1% vs 95.0% in women and 94.8% vs 93.7% in men. Brisk walking has been identified as a moderate-intensity exercise, suitable for meeting American College of Sport Medicine/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendations. It has been suggested that brisk walking is of sufficient intensity to elicit a training response in all but the most highly fit patients with coronary disease. Furthermore, brisk walking is recommended for obese individuals as it may reduce the risk of musculoskeletal injury while providing proper cardiovascular stimulus. Even a modest increase in physical activity, such as brisk walking, can have a significant impact on health and quality of life. Therefore, it can be concluded that brisk walking does lower mortality and that some exercise is better than none at all.",Yes
Can arthroscopy reduce pain or improve mobility?,Yes,"Arthroscopy, a minimally invasive surgical procedure, has been shown to reduce pain and improve mobility in patients with various joint pathologies. This is achieved through the removal of loose bodies, debridement of damaged tissue, and repair or reconstruction of ligaments and cartilage. In cases of anterior impingement syndrome, arthroscopic treatment has been found to increase range of motion. Similarly, for inflammatory arthropathies, arthroscopy with debridement and synovectomy can relieve pain, improve function, and delay disease progression. However, the effectiveness of arthroscopic debridement with or without meniscectomy for relieving pain and improving functional outcomes is uncertain. It is also important to note that arthroscopy is not a cure for osteoarthritis, but it can provide significant benefits to patients with intra-articular pathology. The role of arthroscopy in the treatment of glenohumeral arthritis is evolving, and it is a viable option in certain situations and patients. Nonetheless, in cases where there is no mechanical damage to the knee, nonsurgical conservative methods are recommended. Therefore, while arthroscopy can reduce pain and improve mobility, it should be considered as part of a comprehensive treatment plan tailored to the individual patient's needs and circumstances.",No
Do health benefits increase with duration and intensity of exercise?,Yes,"Justification: The beneficial effect on cardiovascular health and metabolism is augmented by a higher duration and intensity of exercise. Many exercise-related health benefits exhibit a dose-response relationship, indicating that up to a certain point, more exercise is more beneficial. Increasing exercise duration and intensity beyond current recommendations appears to impart additional cardiovascular benefits for most of the population. However, recent data suggests the possibility of an inflection point after which additional exercise may no longer impart benefits and may even result in negative cardiovascular outcomes. Regular exercise results in increases in life expectancy and protects against adverse cardiac events in both healthy subjects and patients with cardiovascular disease. Different exercise intensities may provide distinct health benefits, independent of energy expenditure. The capacity for human exercise performance can be enhanced with prolonged exercise training, whether it is endurance- or strength-based. Chronic exercise or high levels of physical activity have been shown to improve vaccination responses in older adults, illustrating improved immune function. Cohort studies suggest that 'more is better' regarding the exercise dose for increasing cardiorespiratory fitness and that this is mediated through increased cardiorespiratory fitness. A growing body of evidence suggests that exercise training with low-volume but high-intensity may be a time-efficient means to achieve health benefits. Robust epidemiological evidence exists that lifelong regular exercise contributes to longevity. Exercise training above the public health recommendations provides additional benefits regarding disease protection and longevity.",Yes
