Does a mixture of hops and other natural remedies help with sleep problems?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",No,Yes,Yes,"The context suggests that hops (Humulus lupulus) has been used in traditional European medicine as a mild sedative for the treatment of anxiety, nervousness, and insomnia. The hypothermic effects of hops extract, which are possibly mediated through activation of melatonin receptors, have been shown to significantly decrease body temperature in mice, indicating a potential sleep-inducing mechanism. Although the bioactive principle of hop preparations is still not fully understood, daily intake of a hop extract has been found to exert favorable effects on vasomotor symptoms and other menopausal discomforts. Therefore, it is plausible that a mixture of hops and other natural remedies may help with sleep problems. However, further research is needed to elucidate the underlying sleep-inducing mechanism of hops and to determine the optimal combination and dosage of natural remedies for the treatment of sleep problems."
Can Internet-based self-help training based on cognitive behavioral therapy reduce the burden of tinnitus?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"Internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (ICBT) has been found to be an effective treatment for reducing tinnitus-related distress and improving patients' ability to cope with tinnitus. Studies have shown that ICBT can result in significant decreases in tinnitus distress and comorbidities such as insomnia, depression, hyperacusis, and cognitive failures, as well as a significant increase in quality of life. ICBT has also been found to be at least as effective as established individualized face-to-face clinical care in reducing tinnitus distress and tinnitus-related difficulties. Therefore, it can be concluded that Internet-based self-help training based on cognitive behavioral therapy can reduce the burden of tinnitus."
Do nicotine replacement products like nicotine gum or nicotine patches help with long-term smoking cessation?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"Nicotine replacement therapies (NRTs) have been shown to be effective in facilitating smoking cessation. These therapies include nicotine gum, transdermal patches, intranasal spray, and inhaled preparations. The effectiveness of NRTs is influenced by factors such as the clinical setting, the level of nicotine dependency, the dosage and form of NRT used, and the intensity of additional advice and support offered to the smoker. While only one-quarter to one-third of smokers who utilize NRTs to quit smoking are able to maintain long-term abstinence from tobacco use, NRTs have been shown to improve success rates in smoking cessation treatment. Treatment with the nicotine inhaler plus nicotine patch has resulted in significantly higher cessation rates than inhaler plus placebo patch. The nicotine lozenge is also a safe and effective treatment for smoking cessation in low- and high-dependence smokers. Higher doses of nicotine patch may produce small increases in quit rates. Therefore, it can be concluded that nicotine replacement products like nicotine gum or nicotine patches do help with long-term smoking cessation."
Do infusions of vitamin C relieve symptoms of chronic fatigue or long covid?,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",NEI,NEI,NEI,"The current evidence does not support supplementing critically ill patients with vitamin C, including those with chronic fatigue or long COVID-19. Although vitamin C has been shown to reduce the duration and severity of common cold infections, its effects on fatigue have not been well-documented. While vitamin C, as an antioxidant and neuro-modulating agent, can help reduce pain in various clinical settings, its role in relieving symptoms of chronic fatigue or long COVID-19 remains unclear. Further studies, particularly of monotherapy administration, are warranted to determine the potential benefits of vitamin C for these conditions."
Do kava kava supplements help with anxiety disorders?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"Recent clinical trials suggest that kava (piper methysticum) has therapeutic value for the treatment of anxiety. Kava is an herbal remedy widely used for treating mild to moderate cases of anxiety. It has several advantages over conventional pharmacologic treatments, such as better tolerability and lack of physiologic dependence and withdrawal. Kava extracts have shown great potential in minimizing anxiety-associated symptoms and alleviating pain. The data support the safety of kava in treating anxiety at 280 mg kava lactones/day for 4 weeks. Kava extract has exhibited anxiolytic effects in various tests, including the plus maze test and open field test, and has been found to decrease monoamine oxidase (MAO) activity in mice. Although the exact mechanism of action and the extent to which kava may serve as an alternative to pharmaceutical anxiolytics are not fully known, growing research indicates that kava most likely alters concentrations of coadministered psychotropics by inhibiting cytochrome p450 enzymes."
Can topiramate reduce the frequency of migraine attacks?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"The context suggests that topiramate, an anticonvulsant with multiple mechanisms of action, has been shown to be effective in reducing the frequency of migraine attacks. In a study involving 70 episodic migraine patients, those administered topiramate as first-line therapy exhibited a significant decrease in mean migraine frequency from 5.8 to 1.9 per 28 days (p = 0.001). Additionally, topiramate has been found to be well tolerated and effective in reverting chronic migraine with medication overuse to episodic migraine. In a double-blind phase, topiramate-treated patients experienced a significantly lower 28-day migraine frequency compared to placebo (3.31 +/- 1.7 versus 3.83 +/- 2.1; p =.002). These results suggest that topiramate is efficacious and safe as an adjunctive treatment in patients with migraine whose prior response to prophylactic management has been less than satisfactory."
Can CBD (cannabidiol) help with migraines or other headaches?,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",NEI,NEI,NEI,"Cannabidiol (CBD) has been shown to have therapeutic potential for various human diseases, including chronic neurodegenerative diseases, epilepsy, and other convulsive syndromes. However, the use of CBD does not always resolve pain, and there is limited evidence specifically regarding its efficacy in treating migraines or other headaches. While some patients anecdotally report symptoms' relief through consumption of cannabis, more research is needed to determine the potential benefits and risks of CBD for the treatment of migraines and other headaches."
"What are the advantages and disadvantages of vaccinating infants simultaneously with the usual six-dose vaccine (against diphtheria, tetanus, polio, pertussis, hepatitis B, and Haemophilus influenzae B) and a pneumococcal vaccine? (Reader inquiry)","['True', 'NEI', 'False']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"advantages of vaccinating infants simultaneously with the usual six-dose vaccine and a pneumococcal vaccine include reducing the number of injections given to young infants, improving vaccine delivery, and providing protection against multiple diseases in a timely and efficient manner. The disadvantages are not explicitly stated in the provided context, but potential disadvantages could include increased reactogenicity or adverse events due to the administration of multiple vaccines at once. However, the context suggests that the safety and immunogenicity of such combined vaccines have been demonstrated in various studies."
Do antidepressants from the group of serotonin reuptake inhibitors help with depression?,"['True', 'False', 'NEI']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"The context suggests that Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) are a widely prescribed and first-line treatment for depression. SSRIs, which include citalopram, escitalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, and sertraline, are thought to act by increasing extracellular serotonin in the brain by blocking its uptake via the high-affinity serotonin transporter (SERT). This increase in serotonin levels is believed to contribute to their antidepressant effects. The context also mentions that SSRIs are generally used for the treatment of various mood and anxiety disorders, and that they are more effective than psychotherapies for some types of depression. However, it is noted that the relations between antidepressant effects and unique pharmacological properties in respective SSRIs remain unclear."
Can contact with holy water make you sick?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"Justification: The context suggests that holy water in churches and chapels may serve as a source of infection. Microbiological and chemical water quality assessments have revealed the presence of pathogenic microorganisms, including fecal indicators, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus, in holy water samples. Consumption of contaminated water can lead to various diseases such as amoebiasis, cholera, shigellosis, typhoid, and viral infections causing gastroenteritis and hepatitis B. The high concentrations of harmful pathogens in holy water samples pose a significant health risk to the public, particularly in rural areas. Therefore, contact with contaminated holy water can potentially make individuals sick."
Does coffee affect cancer death risk?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",No,Yes,Yes,"Justification: The context suggests that coffee consumption is associated with decreased risk of mortality from all-cause, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. However, it is noted that smoking modifies the observed risk when studying the role of coffee on human health. A meta-analysis found no observational association between coffee intake and overall cancer risk or cancer death, with an estimated odds ratio of 1.01 (0.94, 1.08) for overall cancer risk and 1.11 (0.95, 1.31) for cancer death. However, it is important to note that coffee is a rich source of bioactive compounds that have potential anticarcinogenic effects, and has been hypothesized to have protective effects in colorectal neoplasia. Therefore, it can be concluded that coffee consumption may affect cancer death risk, but further research is needed to fully understand the relationship."
Can hand washing with antibacterial soaps or wash lotions containing other disinfectants reduce the risk of infection compared to regular soap???,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The use of antibacterial soaps or wash lotions containing other disinfectants has been shown to reduce the risk of infection compared to regular soap. Antibacterial lotions can complement washing by providing a demonstrable reduction in bacterial levels on the skin. Antiseptic hand washing and the use of nonsterile gloves over unwashed hands confer similar reductions in the number of microorganisms. The use of alcohol-based hand-rubs has also shown significant reduction of bacterial counts on the examined hands. However, it is important to note that handwashing with soap and water is still more effective for the removal of bacteria of potential faecal origin from hands than handwashing with water alone. Additionally, the use of antimicrobial hand towels did not prevent E. coli contamination of mothers' hands in Kenyan households during random testing and offered no advantages over standard handwashing and drying practices. Therefore, while antibacterial soaps and wash lotions can reduce the risk of infection, they should not be considered a substitute for thorough hand washing and good hygienic practices."
Do cesarean babies have a higher risk of becoming overweight later in life?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"The study suggests that children born by cesarean delivery have a higher risk of being overweight throughout childhood compared to those delivered vaginally. The odds of being overweight are 1.52 times higher for cesarean-born children. The study also indicates that women born by cesarean delivery may have a higher risk of being obese and developing type 2 diabetes during adult life. The results show a greater likelihood of obesity at age 2 years in the cesarean delivery group compared with the vaginal delivery group. However, this association was not observed at older ages. The proportion of obese children was greater in the cesarean delivery group compared with the vaginal delivery group at age 2 years, but not at older ages. Mothers who gave birth by cesarean delivery had a higher mean prepregnancy body mass index, greater mean gestational weight gain, and shorter mean duration of exclusive breastfeeding compared with those who delivered vaginally."
Are heavy (ex-)smokers less likely to die of lung cancer if they regularly participate in lung cancer screening by computed tomography (CT)?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",Yes,Yes,Yes,".

     The National Lung Screening Trial demonstrated a significant reduction in lung cancer-specific mortality among high-risk current and former smokers who underwent yearly low-dose chest computed tomography (CT) screening. This finding was further supported by a recent randomized screening trial, which also showed a reduction in lung cancer mortality with CT scans. The US Preventive Services Task Force recommends annual lung cancer screening with low-dose CT for current and former smokers aged 55-80 years with a 30-pack-year smoking history. The risk-based model for CT screening for lung cancer was estimated to be associated with a greater number of lung cancer deaths prevented over 5 years compared to a model based on USPSTF recommendations. In a trial involving high-risk persons, lung-cancer mortality was significantly lower among those who underwent volume CT screening than among those who underwent no screening. The preliminary results of the National Lung Screening Trial confirmed that lung cancer screening by CT is associated with a reduction in lung cancer mortality compared to a control group undergoing chest X-ray at the same time intervals. Current and former smokers with COPD may disproportionately benefit from lung cancer screening."
Does the risk for the unborn child to develop asthma later on increase if the mother is exposed to high pollen concentrations during pregnancy?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"Justification: The context suggests that maternal exposure to environmental factors, including allergens such as pollen, can influence the development of asthma in offspring. This is supported by evidence from animal models, which demonstrate that exposure to allergens in strongly sensitized mothers influences offspring asthma development. Furthermore, the context indicates that pollen contact in early infancy may enhance the risk for subsequent pollen allergy, and that maternal exposure to airborne pollutants during pregnancy increases airway hyperreactivity in offspring. Therefore, it can be inferred that high pollen concentrations during pregnancy may increase the risk for the unborn child to develop asthma later on."
Does thyme help against cough?,"['True', 'False', 'NEI']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The context suggests that thyme (Thymus vulgaris) has been traditionally used to prepare herbal remedies with antitussive properties. Furthermore, the study investigated the effects of a standardized hydroalcoholic extract of thyme on primary human airway epithelial cell lines in a model of lung inflammation. The results showed that thyme extract has significant anti-inflammatory properties, reducing the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and mucus secretion. Additionally, thyme extracts have been reported to have antispasmodic activity, which may help alleviate cough symptoms. Therefore, based on the available information, it can be inferred that thyme may help against cough."
Are privately performed IgG tests to clarify food intolerances meaningful?,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",NEI,No,No,"The clinical utility of specific IgG4 dosing against food in adult patients with suspected food allergy/intolerance has been evaluated, and it has been found that testing for specific IgG4 lacks clinical utility for the diagnosis of food allergy or intolerance. In a case series of 73 adult patients with suspected food allergy and clinical manifestations of chronic urticaria or other allergy-supposed skin symptoms, it was found that food-specific IgG4 does not indicate (imminent) food allergy or intolerance, but rather a physiological response of the immune system after exposition to food components. Therefore, testing of IgG4 to foods is considered as irrelevant for the laboratory work-up of food allergy or intolerance and should not be performed in case of food-related complaints. These findings, combined with the lack of convincing evidence for histamine-releasing properties of IgG4 in humans, and lack of any controlled studies on the diagnostic value of IgG4 testing in food allergy, do not provide any basis for the hypothesis that food-specific IgG4 should be attributed with an effector role in food hypersensitivity."
"Should wisdom teeth that have not or not completely grown out of the jaw and gums be removed as a precaution? Even if the ""impacted"" teeth are not causing any symptoms at the moment and no pathological changes are to be expected immediately?","['NEI', 'True', 'False']",NEI,NEI,NEI,"Insufficient evidence was found to support or refute routine prophylactic removal of asymptomatic impacted wisdom teeth in adults. While it has been suggested that watchful monitoring of asymptomatic wisdom teeth may be an appropriate strategy, there is no clear evidence to support or refute this approach. The prophylactic removal of asymptomatic impacted wisdom teeth is defined as the surgical removal of wisdom teeth in the absence of local disease. However, this procedure is not recommended without a defined pathologic indication. In the case of asymptomatic condition, a careful examination is necessary because they may develop into pathological status such as dentigerous cysts. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer to the question based on the available evidence."
Does carbonic acid have any health effects on the digestive tract???,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",NEI,No,No,"The context provided does not mention carbonic acid, but rather discusses the effects of carboxylic acids, such as butyric acid, on colonic diseases. It also mentions the role of calcium and chlorogenic acid in the digestive system. Therefore, based on the given context, it is not possible to determine the health effects of carbonic acid on the digestive tract."
"Is the Feldenkrais Method effective against pain and tension in the neck, shoulders and back?","['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The Feldenkrais Method has been shown to be effective in reducing pain and tension in the neck, shoulders, and back. Studies have demonstrated that patients undergoing the Feldenkrais Method reported significantly less pain than controls in the context of chronic neck/scapular pain and chronic low back pain. The method has been found to change muscle tone, leading to a more relaxed supine position and reducing disability index. Additionally, the Feldenkrais Method has been shown to improve quality of life and interoceptive awareness. While the improvements observed with the Feldenkrais Method may not be as large as suggested by anecdotal claims, the method appears to be a promising intervention for chronic pain and tension in the neck, shoulders, and back."
Do smoking bans lead to fewer preterm births?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"The context suggests that smoking cessation during pregnancy can reduce the risk of poor birth outcomes, including preterm birth. Smoking bans, which aim to reduce smoking rates, could therefore contribute to a reduction in preterm births. The context also indicates that smoking during pregnancy is associated with adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes such as preterm delivery, intrauterine growth restriction, stillbirth, and low birth weight. Therefore, it can be inferred that smoking bans, by reducing smoking rates, could lead to fewer preterm births."
Does cupping relieve chronic neck and back pain?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The context suggests that dry cupping therapy has been found to be effective for reducing pain in patients with chronic neck pain and non-specific low back pain. Low-quality evidence revealed that dry cupping had a significant effect on pain reduction for chronic neck pain and low back pain. Moderate-quality evidence suggested that dry cupping improved functional status for chronic neck pain. A single session of dry cupping therapy may be an effective short-term treatment method for immediately reducing pain and increasing oxygenated and total hemoglobin levels in patients with nonspecific neck pain. Cupping therapy is a promising method to cure or reduce the symptoms of some diseases including muscle pain, fatigue, and tension. Cupping is an ancient technique used in treating pain and various disorders. Chinese cupping may be a low-risk, therapeutic treatment for the prompt reduction of symptoms associated with subacute and chronic low back pain."
Does brisk walking lower mortality? Is some exercise better than none at all?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"Brisk walking has been identified as a form of moderate intensity exercise, which is associated with a longer life. Studies have shown that brisk walkers have a survival advantage over slow walkers, irrespective of other lifestyle behaviors, except for smoking. The estimated 10-year survival was higher in brisk walkers who engaged in an unhealthy lifestyle compared to slow walkers who engaged in an otherwise healthy lifestyle. These findings suggest that even a modest increase in physical activity, such as brisk walking, can have a significant impact on health and quality of life. Exercise confers myriad health benefits, including enhanced cardiovascular fitness, improved blood pressure, and decreased prevalence of hypertension and coronary heart disease. Therefore, it can be concluded that brisk walking does lower mortality and that some exercise is better than none at all."
"Can budesonide spray inhalation for covid-19 reduce the risk of hospitalization, severe or even fatal outcome?","['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The use of budesonide in preterm infants has been associated with a decrease in the need for continued mechanical ventilation, severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) type II or death, and grade III BPD or death. Additionally, the use of intra-tracheal instillation of budesonide using surfactant as a vehicle significantly decreased the incidence of BPD or death in preterm infants. Early descriptions of patients admitted to the hospital during the COVID-19 pandemic showed a lower prevalence of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) than would be expected for an acute respiratory disease like COVID-19, leading to speculation that inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) might protect against infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 or the development of serious sequelae. Furthermore, the use of corticosteroids in the treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia has been associated with a significant reduction in hospital mortality. Therefore, it is plausible that the use of budesonide spray inhalation for COVID-19 could reduce the risk of hospitalization, severe, or even fatal outcomes."
Is mannose as good as or better than antibiotics for preventing recurrent cystitis?,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",NEI,NEI,NEI,"The study suggests that d-mannose can be an effective aid in acute cystitis management and a successful prophylactic agent in a selected population. It was found to improve quality of life and significantly reduce recurrent UTIs in both catheter and non-catheter users. The association of d-mannose and NAC therapy resulted in a similar effect to antibiotic therapy in preventing UTIs in patients submitted to urodynamic examination. However, more studies are needed to confirm the results of this pilot study and to compare the effectiveness of d-mannose to antibiotics in preventing recurrent cystitis. Therefore, it is not possible to definitively conclude that d-mannose is as good as or better than antibiotics for preventing recurrent cystitis based on the information provided."
Can a blood test detect mental illness?,"['True', 'False', 'NEI']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The context suggests that research has been ongoing to identify biological markers, specifically transcriptomic biomarkers, in peripheral tissues such as blood cells, for the diagnosis and follow-up of mental illnesses like major depression and schizophrenia. The use of a bioinformatics approach to examine the gene expression signature in whole blood has been explored to make a specific diagnosis of schizophrenia. Furthermore, the membrane potential of blood cells has been proposed as a diagnostic marker for bipolar disorder I. The research also indicates that blood levels of different transcript panels may identify the depressed from the non-depressed, and follow and predict response to cognitive-behavioral therapy in depressed individuals. However, it is important to note that while these findings are promising, more research is needed to fully establish the use of blood tests in the diagnosis and management of mental illnesses."
Can shoe insoles relieve pain in people with high arches?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"The use of therapeutic footwear with specially-made insoles has been shown to relieve pain and reduce ulcer risks in individuals with various foot conditions, such as diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis. In particular, in-shoe foot orthoses have been found to improve conditions such as plantar heel pain (fasciitis) by raising the medial longitudinal arch of the foot and lowering the stress on the plantar tissues. Dynamic impression insoles have also been shown to effectively relieve metatarsal pain due to a larger weight-bearing area. Furthermore, a study found that the use of therapeutic insoles significantly reduced the mean pain score from 7.6 to 1.1 (p<0.001) in individuals with flatfoot deformity. Therefore, it is reasonable to suggest that shoe insoles may also be effective in relieving pain in individuals with high arches."
Can FGXpress Power Strips reduce pain or improve wound healing?,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",NEI,NEI,NEI,"The context provided does not explicitly mention FGXpress Power Strips, thus it is not possible to definitively state whether they can reduce pain or improve wound healing. However, the context does suggest that therapeutic electrical stimulation (ES) and pulsed electromagnetic fields (PEMF) have been found to be effective for bone and wound repair, pain and edema reduction, and increasing the rate of wound healing. Additionally, the application of a monophasic pulsed microcurrent has been shown to help reduce the treatment period for wound contraction. Therefore, if FGXpress Power Strips utilize similar ES or PEMF technology, it is possible that they could have similar effects on pain and wound healing. However, further research would be needed to confirm this."
Can cosmetic products with caffeine for hair and scalp help against hereditary hair loss?,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",NEI,NEI,NEI,"The context provided does not contain explicit information regarding the effectiveness of caffeine-based cosmetic products in treating hereditary hair loss. While the context mentions the use of caffeine in hair growth cosmetic products and its potential protective role in aging-related disorders, it does not provide direct evidence or studies that confirm the efficacy of caffeine in addressing hereditary hair loss. Therefore, it is not possible to definitively state that cosmetic products with caffeine can help against hereditary hair loss based on the given context."
Can stress promote dementia?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"Justification: The context indicates that there is an association between stress and dementia, with previous studies suggesting that stress diagnoses increase the risk of dementia. Longstanding psychological stress has been associated with increased risk of neurodegenerative disorders, such as dementia and Alzheimer's disease. Chronic stress has been implicated in the etiology of Alzheimer's disease and is considered an important risk factor. The study provides evidence that chronic stress accelerates the onset and severity of cognitive deficits, indicating that chronic stress may be an important contributor to the onset and development of Alzheimer's disease."
Does an alkaline bath help with neurodermatitis?,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",NEI,NEI,NEI,"The provided context does not explicitly mention the use of alkaline baths for the treatment of neurodermatitis, also known as atopic dermatitis (AD). The context discusses the use of bathing as a therapeutic measure for AD, the efficacy of two complementary bath products, and the use of baths followed by topical corticosteroid application. However, it does not provide information on the specific use of alkaline baths for AD. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether an alkaline bath helps with neurodermatitis based on the provided context."
"Does starting school later improve health, learning success, and quality of life in adolescents?","['NEI', 'True', 'False']",NEI,NEI,NEI,"The provided context does not directly address the question of whether starting school later improves health, learning success, and quality of life in adolescents. The context primarily focuses on the relationship between health in early adolescence and subsequent academic and employment outcomes, as well as the potential mediators of these relationships. It also discusses the role of school factors in the emergence of poor young adult health outcomes and the association between health and educational aspirations. However, it does not provide information on the effects of starting school later on health, learning success, and quality of life. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer based on the given context."
Does the full moon have a negative effect on sleep duration?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",No,Yes,Yes,"The context suggests that the full moon may have a negative effect on sleep duration, particularly in women. Separate analyses for men and women indicated that in women, total sleep time, stage 4 sleep, and REM sleep were reduced when sleep occurred close to the full moon. However, in men, REM duration increased around the full moon. The interaction between lunar class and sex was significant for total sleep time, stage 4 sleep, and REM sleep. No significant main effect for the factor lunar class was observed for any of the objective sleep parameters and subjective sleep quality, but some significant interactions were observed. These findings suggest that the full moon may have a negative effect on sleep duration, particularly in women."
Is the administration of magnesium through the skin effective?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The administration of magnesium through the skin, also known as topical magnesium application, has been found to be effective in various studies. Upon topical application of magnesium solution, it has been observed that magnesium penetrates through the human stratum corneum, the skin's outermost layer. This permeation depends on the concentration and time of exposure. Topical magnesium delivery is one of the oldest forms of therapy for skin diseases, with examples such as Dead Sea therapy and Epsom salt baths. It has been used as an adjuvant by various routes, including intravenous, intrathecal, and epidural in different dosage regimens. Magnesium is an essential element involved in various biochemical processes in the human body. However, the transport of magnesium ions across the skin's protective barrier, the stratum corneum, is contentious. Despite this, there is evidence that magnesium, when infused into asthmatic patients, can produce bronchodilation in addition to that obtained from standard treatments. Therefore, based on the available evidence, the administration of magnesium through the skin can be considered effective."
"Is active surveillance (""active surveillance"") of patients with low-risk prostate cancer associated with increased prostate cancer mortality risk in the long term?","['NEI', 'True', 'False']",NEI,No,No,"The evidence suggests that active surveillance is not associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer mortality in the long term for men with low-risk prostate cancer. In fact, active surveillance is increasingly recognized as the preferred standard of care for these patients, as it allows for the avoidance of radical treatment and its associated side effects. The aim of active surveillance is to offer radical treatment only to those men who are at higher risk of local progression or metastatic disease. The systematic review of literature on active surveillance for low-risk prostate cancer supports this approach, as it has been found to be a viable treatment option that addresses the issue of overtreatment. The reasons for limited uptake of active surveillance are complex, but it is increasingly utilized as a potential solution to the problem of overdiagnosis and overtreatment of clinically insignificant disease."
"Did oseltamivir (Tamiflu®) or other neuraminidase inhibitors help reduce deaths from the H1N1 influenza virus (""swine flu"" virus)?","['NEI', 'True', 'False']",NEI,Inconclusive,Inconclusive,"The available evidence on whether neuraminidase inhibitors, such as oseltamivir, reduce mortality in patients with influenza is inconclusive. While oseltamivir has been shown to be effective in reducing symptom burden and preventing infection in those with influenza A or B, its impact on mortality is not definitively established. Clinical practices have demonstrated that oseltamivir was effective in treating the 2009-H1N1 influenza, but failed to treat the 2006-H5N1 avian influenza. The evidence focuses solely on influenza A/H1N1pdm09, and further research is needed to determine the extent to which neuraminidase inhibitors reduce mortality in patients with influenza."
Does taking rosehip powder for rheumatoid arthritis improve symptoms?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",No,Yes,Yes,"The evidence suggests that rosehip powder may have a beneficial effect on the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis. A previously published systematic review and meta-analysis have concluded that the consumption of standardized rose hip powder (rosa canina l.) can reduce pain in osteoarthritis patients. Furthermore, a meta-analysis of three randomized controlled trials involving 287 patients with a median treatment period of 3 months reported that treatment with standardized rosehip powder consistently reduced pain scores and that patients allocated to rosehip powder were twice as likely to respond to rosehip compared to placebo. Additionally, the genus rosa (roses) has long been used in traditional or folk medicine worldwide for the treatment of various types of arthritis including rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis. Rosehips, which contain a particular type of galactolipid, have a specific anti-inflammatory action. In contrast to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and aspirin, rosehip has anti-inflammatory actions that do not have ulcerogenic effects and do not inhibit platelets nor influence the coagulation cascade or fibrinolysis."
Does LOW dose atropine (0.05% or less) sustainably inhibit the progression of myopia in children???,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The context suggests that low-dose atropine (0.05% or less) has been found to sustainably inhibit the progression of myopia in children. Studies have shown that regular topical administration of 0.025% atropine eye drops can prevent myopia onset and myopic shift in premyopic schoolchildren for a 1-year period. Additionally, the efficacy and safety of atropine 0.01% in slowing myopia progression in European paediatric patients has been evaluated. The effectiveness of atropine in controlling the progression of myopia was found to be dose-related, with lower concentrations of atropine (0.5 to 0.01%) being associated with fewer symptoms while still controlling myopia. Therefore, it can be concluded that low-dose atropine (0.05% or less) can sustainably inhibit the progression of myopia in children."
Can sexual activity relieve headaches?,"['True', 'False', 'NEI']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The data suggests that sexual activity can lead to partial or complete relief of headache in some migraine and cluster headache patients. In migraine, 60% of patients who had experience with sexual activity during an attack reported an improvement, with 70% of them reporting moderate to complete relief. Similarly, in cluster headache, 37% of patients who had experience with sexual activity during an attack reported an improvement, with 91% of them reporting moderate to complete relief. However, it is important to note that sexual activity can also worsen headaches in some patients. The cause of headaches related to sexual activity ranges from benign to life-threatening, and the underlying mechanisms are not yet fully understood."
Does aloe vera relieve discomfort caused by psoriasis?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"Aloe vera has been traditionally used for the treatment of skin diseases, including psoriasis, and has demonstrated good results in various clinical trials. The systematic review of clinical trials assessing the effectiveness and safety of aloe for the treatment of psoriasis concluded that administration of aloe as cutaneous treatment is generally well tolerated, with no serious side effects reported. Patients in the topical aloe cream group had significantly less postoperative pain at hours 12, 24, and 48 hours and at 2 weeks. The medicinal plant, aloe vera, promotes wound healing in burn injuries and has been used for the prevention and cure of various diseases and symptoms, including skin disorders. Aloe vera gel has been widely used in skin care and is widely used in the treatment of an array of disturbances, especially skin disorders. The data indicated that both aloe vera gel and cape aloe extract significantly improved wound healing in human primary epidermal keratinocytes and a human skin equivalent model. Therefore, it can be concluded that aloe vera relieves discomfort caused by psoriasis."
"Can a dietary supplement containing omega-3 fatty acids, lipids, vitamins, and nutrients (""Souvenaid"") noticeably slow or halt the decline of mental performance in Alzheimer\","['True', 'NEI', 'False']",No,Yes,Yes,"The dietary supplement Souvenaid, which contains omega-3 fatty acids, lipids, vitamins, and nutrients, has been shown to have a significant effect on several cognitive domains in patients with mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease. Studies have demonstrated that Souvenaid can improve or maintain cognition and has an effect on neurodegeneration biomarkers. The effects of omega-3 fatty acids supplementation in mild Alzheimer's disease corroborate epidemiological observational studies showing that omega-3 fatty acids may be beneficial in disease onset, when there is slight impairment of brain function. Regular consumption of food enriched in omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids has been shown to reduce the risk of cognitive decline in the elderly and possibly the development of Alzheimer's disease. Nutritional supplementation with long-chain polyunsaturated omega-3 fatty acids may exert beneficial effects on brain structure and function. The age-related decline in cognitive function has been associated with biochemical changes that can be attenuated following n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid treatment."
Does curcumin protect healthy people from mental impairment or even from developing dementia?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The context suggests that curcumin has therapeutic potential as a preventive agent against the deterioration of cognitive faculties. Studies have shown that curcumin possesses neuroprotective and cognitive-enhancing properties that may help delay or prevent neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease. In vitro and animal studies have demonstrated that curcumin alters Aβ metabolism, influences brain function, and reduces oxidative stress and inflammation, which are associated with cognitive decline and dementia. Curcumin has been shown to improve cognitive function in the elderly and to have a potential to act on the symptoms of neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that curcumin may protect healthy people from mental impairment and even from developing dementia."
Does regular consumption of coffee increase the risk of heart disease such as heart attack or stroke?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",No,Yes,Yes,"The context suggests that heavy coffee consumption has been associated with an increased risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) and acute myocardial infarction or coronary death. Chronic coffee consumption may also exert a detrimental effect on aortic stiffness and wave reflections, which may increase the risk of cardiovascular disease. However, it is important to note that moderate coffee consumption is unlikely to adversely affect cardiovascular health for most healthy people. The adverse effects of chronic coffee consumption on traditional risk factors for CHD are less consistent, with coffee intake slightly increasing blood pressure and plasma concentrations of homocysteine and cholesterol, but with no association with the incidence of hypertension and a strong negative association with the incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus. In meta-analyses of recent well-controlled prospective epidemiologic studies, coffee-consumption was not associated with risk of coronary heart disease and weakly associated with a lower risk of stroke and heart failure."
Does gargling with hydrogen peroxide have health risks?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"Gargling with hydrogen peroxide can pose health risks, as it is a highly reactive substance that can cause damage to oral soft tissues and hard tissues when present in high concentrations and with prolonged exposure. While there is evidence for the safety of hydrogen peroxide when used at low concentrations in self-administered oral health care products, caution should be exercised with higher concentration peroxide products. Ingestion of hydrogen peroxide can result in morbidity through direct caustic injury, oxygen gas formation, and lipid peroxidation. Additionally, hydrogen peroxide is not more effective than other antiseptics and its potentially serious risks should not be unrecognized. Concerns regarding hydrogen peroxide carcinogenicity arise from its ability to act as a strong oxidizing agent. Therefore, it is recommended to avoid ingesting hydrogen peroxide or using it in situations where the evolved oxygen gas cannot dissipate freely."
Do household cleaners and room fresheners in spray form cause damage to the heart?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"Long-term frequent use of household spray and scented products has been associated with reduced heart rate variability (HRV) in predominantly older adult women. Reduced HRV is a marker of autonomic cardiac dysfunction and suggests an increased risk of cardiovascular health hazards. The use of cleaning sprays can result in chemical airway exposure, with particles in the relevant size range for both nasal and alveolar deposition. Chemical substances present in cleaning products could be responsible for these effects. Therefore, it can be inferred that household cleaners and room fresheners in spray form have the potential to cause damage to the heart."
Does vitamin D alleviate autism symptoms in children?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The literature suggests that vitamin D may have a potential role in the prevention and treatment of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). A high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency has been reported in children with ASD, and supplementation with vitamin D3 has been found to significantly improve the outcome of some children with ASD, especially younger children. A 12-month randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of vitamin D supplementation in 73 New Zealand children with ASD found that vitamin D may improve ASD symptoms. However, more studies with longer duration are needed to confirm these results. The effect of vitamin D supplementation on the risk of ASD is conflicting, and the results of randomized controlled trials are mixed and inconclusive. Nevertheless, there is strong mechanistic evidence to suggest that vitamin D and omega-3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids have the potential to significantly improve the symptoms of ASD."
"Is short, high-intensity training equally effective as longer, moderate-intensity training?","['NEI', 'False', 'True']",Yes,No,No,"The literature suggests that high-intensity interval training (HIIT) is more effective than moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT) in improving functional ability and increasing peak oxygen consumption (VO2max). However, it has not been studied when HIIT is applied in a circuit (HIICT) and direct comparisons with higher-volume MICT under unsupervised settings are limited. Furthermore, although HIIT protocols are time efficient, they are not superior to conventional exercise training in sedentary young adults. Therefore, it cannot be concluded that short, high-intensity training is equally effective as longer, moderate-intensity training."
Can regular intake of vitamin C prevent colds?,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",No,No,No,"The studies conducted on the effect of vitamin C on the common cold have not shown a significant decrease in the incidence of colds with regular supplementation. Although vitamin C has been shown to consistently decrease the duration of cold episodes and the severity of symptoms, it has not been unequivocally shown to affect the incidence of colds. The failure of vitamin C supplementation to reduce the incidence of colds in the general population indicates that routine vitamin C supplementation is not justified. However, vitamin C may be useful for people exposed to brief periods of severe physical exercise."
Do people with blood group AB have a higher risk of developing dementia?,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",No,No,No,"The study showed no association between ABO blood group and risk of Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia, or unspecified dementia. The results provide no evidence that ABO blood group influences the risk of dementia. However, recent data indicates that blood group AB is associated with impaired cognition in elderly patients, and there is a higher incidence of cognitive deficits in ABO blood-type system 'AB' individuals. Additionally, ABO blood group has been linked to the risks for cardiovascular diseases and cancers that affect lifespan. A potential role for the ABI3 gene has been suggested in the risk of Alzheimer's disease, but the detailed mechanism before typical AD onset was unclear. To date, there are no large-scale studies that have examined the relationship between ABO blood group and dementia-related disorders in detail."
"Can willow bark tea help with inflammation, pain or fever?","['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The study indicates that black tea, which is derived from the leaves of the plant Camellia sinensis, has potential anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects. The anti-inflammatory effects of black tea decoction have been demonstrated in both acute and chronic inflammatory models, with significant reductions in rat paw edema. The effects are attributed to salicin and structurally related phenolic metabolites, while polyphenols including procyanidins are suggested to contribute to the overall effect of willow bark. Extracts of the bark of willow species have been used for their potential immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory activities. Therefore, it can be inferred that willow bark tea may have potential benefits in managing inflammation, pain, or fever."
Does bisphenol A trigger allergies?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"Justification: The context indicates that bisphenol A (BPA) has been linked with pediatric asthma development and allergic airway inflammation in animal models. The findings suggest that BPA exposure can promote pro-inflammatory activation and morphological alterations, which may contribute to organ injury. Although the direct causation between BPA and allergies in humans is not explicitly stated, the evidence of BPA's role in inducing oxidative stress and inflammation in animal models suggests that it may trigger allergies."
Does eye training help prevent myopia?,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",No,NEI,NEI,"The use of visual training to stabilize myopia appears to be helpful for many patients, while remaining ineffective for others. Methods of visual training can produce a false image of visual improvement from an enhanced parasympathetic response to a task, but this effect may be a factor that induces progression of myopia. Randomized controlled trials with comparisons of the effectiveness of interventions to decrease myopia progression in myopic children were reviewed, but the results are not conclusive. Therefore, it is not possible to definitively state whether eye training helps prevent myopia."
Does Spirulina help with obesity?,"['True', 'False', 'NEI']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The evidence suggests that spirulina supplementation has a beneficial effect on obesity-related parameters. A meta-analysis demonstrated significant decreases in body mass, body mass index, and waist circumference after three months of spirulina supplementation. Additionally, a double-blind placebo-controlled trial found that spirulina supplementation at a dose of 1 g/d for 12 weeks was effective in modulating body weight and appetite and partly modifying serum lipids. Furthermore, spirulina has been shown to improve insulin sensitivity, plasma lipid levels, and inflammation and oxidative stress biomarkers in obese individuals with well-treated hypertension. These findings suggest that spirulina supplementation may be a promising therapeutic approach for obese patients."
,"['True', 'False', 'NEI']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The context suggests that ginseng has been shown to have cognition-enhancing effects in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. Ginseng has been reported to improve cognitive function in animals and in healthy and cognitively impaired individuals. Studies have demonstrated the potential efficacy of a heat-processed form of ginseng on cognitive function and behavioral symptoms in patients with moderately severe AD. The results suggest that panax ginseng is clinically effective in the cognitive performance of AD patients. Preclinical studies have confirmed that ginseng and its active components are pharmacologically efficacious in different models of cognitive impairment. However, there is currently a lack of convincing evidence to show a cognitive enhancing effect of panax ginseng in healthy participants and no high-quality evidence about its efficacy in patients with dementia."
Can dark field analysis indicate other health problems?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"Dark field analysis, a method used to assess dark adaptation, may indicate other health problems. Dark adaptation is a complex process involving two visual cycles and various factors, including vitamin D levels. Research suggests that vitamin D deficiency is associated with a wide range of health effects, such as depressive disorders and lung function impairment. Moreover, vitamin D levels may serve as a marker of overall health status. Given the interconnectedness of these factors, it is plausible that dark field analysis could provide insights into other health problems beyond visual function. However, further investigations are needed to establish the clinical utility of dark adaptation in diagnosing various health conditions."
"Do turmeric preparations alleviate the symptoms of knee osteoarthritis (""joint wear"") better than a placebo?","['NEI', 'True', 'False']",NEI,NEI,NEI,"The context does not provide information on the efficacy of turmeric preparations in alleviating the symptoms of knee osteoarthritis. Therefore, it is not possible to determine if turmeric preparations are more effective than a placebo in this regard. The context discusses various other treatments, such as acupuncture, diclofenac, ESWT, and herbal preparations like Duhuo Jisheng Tang and ""tlpl/ay/03/2008,"" but there is no mention of turmeric preparations."
Can eating grapefruit in combination with some medications lead to harmful interactions?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"Ingesting grapefruit or its juice in conjunction with certain medications can indeed lead to harmful interactions. This is primarily due to the presence of furanocoumarins in grapefruit, which are known to interact with a variety of medications. These interactions can affect the metabolism of certain drugs, particularly those metabolized via the intestinal cytochrome p450 (CYP) 3A enzymes. This can result in either an increase or decrease in the systemic exposure of these medications, potentially leading to adverse effects or reduced efficacy. Prominent medications known to interact with grapefruit include statins, antiarrhythmic agents, immunosuppressive agents, and calcium channel blockers. It is important to note that the variable composition of grapefruit juice and the individual patient's response can make it difficult to predict the exact magnitude and clinical consequences of these interactions. Therefore, caution is advised when consuming grapefruit or its juice during drug therapy, especially when the drug has a narrow therapeutic margin or carries a risk of serious dose-dependent adverse effects."
Is glyphosate carcinogenic?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has classified glyphosate as a Group 2A substance, which is ""probably carcinogenic to humans."" This classification is based on evidence that glyphosate has tumor-promoting activity and has been shown to cause various types of tumors in animal studies. Although the European Chemicals Agency has concluded that glyphosate is not proven to be carcinogenic, the IARC's classification reflects the consensus of a group of international experts and is widely recognized as a reliable indicator of a substance's potential to cause cancer in humans. It is important to note that the IARC's classification is based on the weight of evidence from multiple studies, and that the specific mechanisms by which glyphosate may cause cancer are not yet fully understood. However, the available evidence suggests that glyphosate is a probable carcinogen and that its widespread use in agriculture may pose a risk to human health."
Does the pregnancy hormone hCG help with weight loss?,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",No,No,No,"The context provided suggests that the use of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) hormone in conjunction with diet for weight loss has not been found to have an advantage over diet alone in rats. Additionally, the context indicates that the prevention of gestational weight loss has been a priority for clinicians, and recent work suggests that gestational weight loss may be beneficial for obese mothers. However, the context does not provide evidence to support the claim that hCG specifically aids in weight loss. Therefore, based on the information provided, it is not accurate to state that hCG helps with weight loss."
Does geranium extract help against colds and sinusitis???,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"Geranium extract, specifically its characteristic components citronellol and geraniol, have been shown to exhibit anti-inflammatory activities, which supports their potential therapeutic use for inflammation-associated disorders. In the context of colds and sinusitis, these components have been found to alleviate nasal symptoms in allergic rhinitis by controlling the allergen-induced inflammatory process. Geraniol treatment has been able to suppress biomarkers associated with allergic rhinitis and decrease nasal rub scores. Furthermore, geranium extract has been used traditionally for treating cough, cold, and sore throat. These findings suggest that geranium extract may indeed be beneficial against colds and sinusitis."
Is microwave therapy effective and safe for long-term reduction of excessive sweating (primary hyperhidrosis) in adults?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The context suggests that a new microwave-based device has been developed for the treatment of axillary hyperhidrosis, which selectively heats the interface between the skin and underlying fat where the sweat glands reside. The results demonstrate that microwave technology is well-suited for targeting sweat glands while allowing for protection of both the upper skin layers and the structures beneath the subcutaneous fat. A systematic review of the clinical effectiveness and safety of treatments available in secondary care for the management of primary hyperhidrosis was also undertaken. Additionally, thermal Nd:YAG lasers used with an interstitial fiber, microwave devices, and photodynamic therapy appear to offer new treatment options for axillary hyperhidrosis. Therefore, it can be inferred that microwave therapy is effective and safe for long-term reduction of excessive sweating in adults with primary hyperhidrosis."
Does treatment with cortisone-like drugs such as dexamethasone ensure that more critically ill patients survive Covid 19 disease?,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",Yes,No,No,"The use of corticosteroids, such as dexamethasone, in critically ill patients with COVID-19 has been associated with lower 28-day all-cause mortality and an increase in the number of ventilator-free days. However, it cannot be definitively stated that treatment with corticosteroids ensures that more critically ill patients survive COVID-19 disease. The impact of corticosteroid therapy on outcomes of patients with COVID-19 is highly controversial, and while some studies have reported a significant reduction in risk of in-hospital death, others have not found a significant reduction in treatment failure. Additionally, it is important to note that corticosteroid therapy is not associated with delayed viral clearance and is not recommended for patients with mild or moderate COVID-19."
Is a gluten-free diet recommended for people who do not have celiac disease?,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",NEI,No,No,"The context suggests that a gluten-free diet is primarily recommended for individuals with celiac disease, a gluten-induced hypersensitivity reaction. Although the diet is increasingly adopted by people without this condition, there is minimal evidence that suggests gluten is a trigger for gastrointestinal symptoms in these individuals. The context also mentions that gluten-free diet followers without celiac disease have a higher prevalence of certain health conditions. Therefore, based on the provided context, a gluten-free diet is not generally recommended for people who do not have celiac disease."
,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The context suggests that gels and ointments containing various botanical extracts have been used for the local treatment of venous and microcirculatory alterations, including varicose veins and chronic venous insufficiency. The use of aescin + essential phospholipids (aepl) topical gels has been shown to be beneficial in improving microcirculation, capillary flow, and vascular tone, as well as strengthening the connective tissue of the perivascular amorphous substrate. The loss of vascular integrity is associated with the pathogenesis of both hemorrhoids and varicose veins, and topical treatment with aepl in areas of venous microangiopathy can prevent ulceration and improve skin healing processes. While the context does not specifically mention the use of arnica, hawthorn, cypress, butcher's broom, Asian (or Indian) pennywort, and heparin in gels or ointments, it suggests that such botanical extracts may have similar benefits in relieving discomfort and secondary symptoms of varicose veins."
Does taking ginger reduce nausea and vomiting during pregnancy?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The present study suggests that ginger is effective in reducing nausea and vomiting in pregnant women during the first trimester. The study found that ginger might improve nausea and vomiting by about 4 points on a 40-point scale or stop vomiting for 1 in 3 women at 6 days. The study also found that ginger was more effective for nausea (intensity and distress) and distress of vomit. However, it is important to note that the study also mentions that there is currently insufficient clinical evidence to support the use of ginger for nausea and vomiting of pregnancy, and further studies are needed to determine the proper dosage and safety of this drug for a pregnant mother and her fetus."
Do behavioral therapy methods help with specific fears (phobias) such as fear of spiders?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"Justification: The findings indicate that exposure therapy, a behavioral treatment method, is effective in reducing avoidance behaviors and negative beliefs associated with spider phobia. In-vivo exposure therapy, which involves real-life exposure to feared stimuli, has been found to be particularly beneficial. Additionally, the use of realistically animated spider stimuli in computer-based interventions and virtual reality exposure therapy has also shown promise. The study also highlights the role of disgust in spider phobia and suggests that exposure therapy can be effective in reducing fear and perceived danger, especially at high levels of pretreatment disgust propensity. However, more research is needed to fully understand the role of disgust in the treatment of spider phobia."
"Do preparations with rose root have an effect against stress and its consequences, e.g. exhaustion?","['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The context suggests that preparations with rose root, specifically Rhodiola rosea (R. rosea), have an effect against stress and its consequences, such as exhaustion. R. rosea is classified as a traditional herbal medicinal product for temporary relief of stress symptoms, such as fatigue and weakness. The reported capacity of R. rosea to strengthen the organism against stress and its good tolerability offer a promising approach in the treatment of stress-related burnout. In an acute mild stress model, R. rosea decreased corticosterone level and increased expression of stress-responsive genes, especially in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. The results presented provide an encouraging basis for clinical trials further investigating the clinical outcomes of R. rosea extract in patients with the burnout syndrome. R. rosea extract has a stimulating effect on the CNS, suggesting potential benefits on cognitive functions, memory, learning, and attention."
Does condom use cause depression in women?,"['NEI', 'False', 'True']",NEI,No,No,"The evidence does not support the claim that condom use causes depression in women. In fact, the research suggests that depressive symptoms and suicide attempts among females who used condoms were proportional to the consistency of condom use. However, it is important to note that depressed young women are at particularly high risk of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and may be more likely to use condoms incorrectly. The study also found that for females who did not use condoms, depression scores went up as the amount of time since their last sexual encounter increased. Therefore, it is not the use of condoms that causes depression, but rather the lack of condom use and incorrect use that may be associated with depression."
Is ivermectin an effective drug for treating covid 19 disease?,"['False', 'True', 'NEI']",No,Yes,Yes,"Ivermectin, an anti-helminthic drug, has been proposed for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19. In vitro studies have shown that ivermectin inhibits the replication of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. A systematic review and meta-analysis of currently available data on the therapeutic potential of ivermectin for the treatment of COVID-19 as an add-on therapy revealed that adding ivermectin led to significant clinical improvement compared to usual therapy. Ivermectin has also demonstrated broad-spectrum antiviral activity against both DNA and RNA viruses. However, further investigation is warranted to explore the potential benefits of ivermectin in humans."
Does extract from the Damiana plant (Turnera diffusa) help with erectile dysfunction?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The results indicate that Turnera diffusa, also known as Damiana, has been shown to have aphrodisiac effects in traditional medicine. Experimental studies have demonstrated that a chemically characterized aqueous extract of Turnera diffusa facilitated the expression of male sexual behavior in rats, specifically by shortening ejaculation latency. Furthermore, Turnera diffusa has been found to increase sexual motivation and performance in sexually sluggish male rats, with the pro-sexual effect involving the participation of the nitric oxide (NO) pathway. The study also supports the traditional use of extracts from Turnera diffusa in erectile dysfunction. Additionally, the extract of Turnera diffusa and two isolated compounds, pinocembrin and acacetin, have been shown to significantly suppress aromatase activity, which is associated with erectile function. Therefore, the evidence suggests that extract from the Damiana plant (Turnera diffusa) may help with erectile dysfunction."

However, it does not specifically address the effects of transcranial pulse stimulation (TPS) on mental performance in people with AD. Therefore, there is not enough information to definitively answer the question. Further research is needed to determine the potential benefits of TPS on mental performance and quality of life in people with AD."
Does taking magnesium salts decrease the frequency and intensity of muscle cramps with unknown cause?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",No,No,No,"The claim that taking magnesium salts decreases the frequency and intensity of muscle cramps with unknown cause is not supported by the provided context. A double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized controlled trial was conducted on 46 community-dwelling older adult rest cramp sufferers to determine whether 5 consecutive days infusion of 20-mmol (5 g) magnesium sulfate would reduce the frequency of leg cramps per week. The results showed that intravenous magnesium infusion did not reduce the frequency of leg cramps in a group of older adult rest cramp sufferers regardless of the extent to which infused magnesium was retained. The mean change in number of cramps per week, magnesium versus placebo arms, was -2.4 versus -1.7, p = .51, 95% confidence interval of the difference -3.1 to 1.7. Therefore, the data suggest that magnesium therapy is not indicated for the treatment of rest cramps in a geriatric population."
"Do remedies containing the trifoliate fruit alleviate the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis (""rheumatism"")?","['True', 'NEI', 'False']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"The context suggests that remedies containing the trifoliate fruit, specifically choerospondias axillaris, have been observed to reduce inflammation in inflammatory diseases like rheumatoid arthritis (RA). This is supported by scientific evidence which indicates that traditional medicaments exert beneficial effects on RA through various cellular mechanisms. These include the downregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-6, and NF-κB, suppression of oxidative stress, inhibition of cartilage degradation, and enhancement of antioxidant performance. The study further demonstrates the anti-arthritic activity of R. centifolia, validating its traditional use for the treatment of RA. Therefore, it can be inferred that remedies containing the trifoliate fruit may alleviate the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis."
"Do mouth rinses with hydroxyapatite, for example the products ""Linola sept mouth rinse"" and ""Karex Abwehr"", protect against SARS-CoV-2 infection?","['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The context suggests that mouth rinses can significantly reduce virus infectivity, including SARS-CoV-2. Hydroxyapatite is a common component in dental hygiene agents and has been found to be effective in preventing caries, treating hypersensitivity, and curing periodontal diseases. The use of mouth rinses with minimal potential disruption of cells may help identify active agents that can reduce SARS-CoV-2 spread. Therefore, it can be inferred that mouth rinses with hydroxyapatite, such as ""Linola sept mouth rinse"" and ""Karex Abwehr"", may protect against SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, further research is needed to confirm this."
Can too much iodine cause autoimmune thyroid disease and consequently hypothyroidism?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"Excessive iodine intake has been shown to induce hypothyroidism in patients with underlying thyroid disorders, including autoimmune thyroiditis such as Hashimoto's thyroiditis. This is supported by epidemiological studies that have observed an increase in the prevalence of overt and subclinical hypothyroidism, as well as autoimmune thyroiditis, with increasing iodine intake. The mechanisms involved are not fully understood, but it is thought that iodine excess may interact with the immune system and trigger the development of autoimmune thyroid disease. Additionally, high doses of ingested iodine have been observed to predict and increase the incidence of the thyroiditis process. These findings suggest that excessive iodine intake may lead to thyroid dysfunction through both biochemical and immunological mechanisms, particularly in patients with autoimmune thyroid disorders."
Do extracts of prickly pear (Opuntia ficus-indica) help with hangover symptoms after alcohol consumption?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The extracts of prickly pear (Opuntia ficus-indica) have been shown to help with hangover symptoms after alcohol consumption. The fruit extracts contain betalain pigments and polyphenols, including flavonoids, which have been introduced as reducing hangover symptoms and liver protective activity. The hydroalcoholic extract of prickly pear seeds has been characterized for its therapeutic effects, including antinociceptive and anti-inflammatory action. The traditional use of prickly pear for alleviating alcohol hangover has been supported by mouse PK data, which showed that the pear extract decreased the alcohol level in blood regardless of ALDH2 genotype. The high content of bioactive compounds in prickly pear has also been shown to have antioxidant, antimicrobial, and anticancer properties. The consistent in vitro and in vivo data suggest that Korean pears stimulate the two key alcohol-metabolizing enzymes."
Can Theta Healing help with physical ailments and mental problems?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"Theta Healing, a form of mind-body therapy, has been shown to be beneficial for various physical ailments and mental problems. This is based on the principle that healing touch and other similar techniques can improve physiologic and psychologic complaints, health perception, and overall well-being. Theta Healing, like other mind-body therapies, involves the practitioner entering a meditative state and passing their hands above the patient's body to find and correct any imbalances in the patient's 'life energy' or chi. This process can help to rebalance the energy circulating in the body, thereby alleviating pain and discomfort associated with various conditions. Furthermore, Theta Healing has been used to treat various diseases without inflicting mental trauma or the pain of surgery, and it can be used in conjunction with conventional medical care to restore health. Therefore, it is plausible that Theta Healing could be effective in helping with physical ailments and mental problems."
Does short-term fasting reduce the side effects of chemotherapy for cancer???,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"According to a series of studies, short-term fasting has been shown to reduce the side effects of chemotherapy in cancer patients. Preclinical evidence suggests that short-term fasting (STF) protects healthy cells against the side effects of chemotherapy and increases the vulnerability of cancer cells to it. Clinical studies have also suggested that repeated short-term fasting may reduce the side effects of chemotherapy, enhance quality of life, and slow down tumor progression. In a recent study, 10 patients who fasted in combination with chemotherapy reported a reduction in a wide range of side effects, including fatigue, weakness, and gastrointestinal side effects. Additionally, preclinical studies have suggested that fasting prior to chemotherapy may be an effective strategy to protect patients against the adverse effects of chemotherapy. Fasting has also been shown to potentially improve the response of tumor cells to chemotherapy by repairing DNA damage in normal tissues, upregulating autophagy flux, altering apoptosis, and depleting regulatory T cells."
Does disulfiram improve the effectiveness of chemotherapy for cancer?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"Disulfiram, a drug used to treat alcoholism, has been indicated to play a primary as well as an adjuvant role in the treatment of many cancers. Disulfiram has been shown to be effective against various types of cancers in preclinical studies. It is known to elicit anticancer effects alone or improve the efficacy of many cancer drugs. Disulfiram in combination with copper has been reported to override drug resistance in cancer cells. Disulfiram combined with chemotherapy based on the microtubule inhibitor vinorelbine appears to prolong survival in non-small cell lung cancer patients. The attenuation of AE2 and its supportive enzyme CA12, and the inhibitory effect on cell migration by disulfiram treatment in cancer cells provided the molecular evidence supporting the potential of disulfiram as an anticancer agent. Therefore, it can be concluded that disulfiram improves the effectiveness of chemotherapy for cancer."
Can weight loss programs reduce obesity in children and adolescents?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"The efficiency of lifestyle intervention for childhood obesity has been proven by several randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses. These interventions, which include diet, physical activity, and behavioral modifications, have been shown to be effective in reducing body mass index (BMI) in children and adolescents. Multidisciplinary programs that involve medical, psychological, and nutritional sessions have been found to have encouraging long-term effects. However, it is important to note that weight loss interventions tend to demonstrate efficacy in the short-term, but individuals may slowly revert back to their original weight status over time. Therefore, weight loss maintenance approaches in childhood are thought to be promising, but a structured overview of these maintenance interventions is lacking. Early prevention and treatment of childhood and adolescent obesity is mandated, and a combination of lifestyle changes including strategies to reduce energy intake, increase physical activity, reduce sedentary activities, facilitate family involvement, and change behaviors associated with eating and physical activity are recommended."
"Does propolis have a preventive or soothing effect against infection with coronavirus, colds or flu?","['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"Propolis, a resinous material produced by honey bees, has been shown to have a diverse array of biological activities, including anti-inflammatory, antiviral, immunostimulatory, and carcinostatic activities. In pre-clinical studies, propolis has been found to promote immunoregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6, IL-1 beta, and TNF-α. Additionally, propolis and its components have been shown to have anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory activities. Furthermore, propolis components have inhibitory effects on the ACE2, TMPRSS2, and PAK1 signaling pathways, and antiviral activity has been proven in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, it can be inferred that propolis may have a preventive or soothing effect against infection with coronavirus, colds, or flu. However, more research is needed to confirm these findings and determine the optimal dosage and duration of propolis use for these purposes."

Therefore, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer based solely on the given information.

     However, it is important to note that the context discusses the potential health benefits of natural mineral water and groundwater, which are believed to possess beneficial effects due to their natural source of various minerals. Clinical and pharmacological analyses have suggested that certain types of groundwater, such as Jeju groundwater, may have protective effects against hyperlipidemia, fatty liver, and skin inflammation.

     Nevertheless, the use of semi-precious stones in jugs and their potential health effects is a separate issue that requires further research and evidence to support any claims."
Do air purifiers help relieve symptoms of allergic asthma?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",No,Yes,Yes,"The use of air purifiers, specifically HEPA air purifiers, has been shown to effectively reduce particulate matter and house dust mite allergen concentration in indoor air. This reduction in allergen exposure can lead to improvement in clinical manifestations of patients with allergic rhinitis. Furthermore, air purifiers have been recommended by clinicians for patients with allergic rhinitis, and have been shown to be effective in removing pollen from homes, thereby decreasing the risk of symptoms. In asthmatic patients, airway hyperresponsiveness and allergic inflammatory changes are regarded as the primary manifestations of the disease. The main goals of asthma treatment are to decrease inflammation and maximize bronchodilation. The use of air purifiers can contribute to this by reducing allergen exposure and improving airway hyperresponsiveness. Therefore, it can be concluded that air purifiers can help relieve symptoms of allergic asthma."
Does hawthorn extract help patients with heart muscle weakness (heart failure)?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"Hawthorn extract has been used for centuries for cardiovascular diseases, including heart failure. Recent trials have demonstrated its efficacy for the treatment of heart failure, and it has been shown to have cardiotonic effects. The flavonoid components of hawthorn may be responsible for its beneficial effects in treating heart failure. Hawthorn extract has been shown to modify left ventricular remodeling and counteract myocardial dysfunction in early pressure overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy. However, the exact mechanism by which hawthorn extract treats heart failure is unknown, and its efficacy when added to contemporary evidence-based heart failure therapy is also unknown. Nevertheless, hawthorn extract is a popular herbal medicine given as adjunctive treatment for chronic heart failure."
Is stool transplantation effective against recurrent Clostridium difficile infections ?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has been shown to be an effective therapy for recurrent Clostridium difficile infections. The procedure involves the transfer of fecal matter from a healthy donor to a patient with recurrent C. difficile infection, aiming to restore the normal gut microbiota. Studies have demonstrated that FMT is highly effective, safe, and has practically no adverse effects. The procedure is also inexpensive and easy to perform, making it a viable alternative to antibiotic therapy. FMT has been shown to effectively reduce the recurrence of C. difficile infection and promote the restoration of normal gut microbiota. Furthermore, FMT provides a mortality benefit over standard of care for severe and fulminant C. difficile infection in critically ill patients. However, concerns regarding donor infection transmission and patient acceptance may limit the use of FMT."
Do milk or dairy products promote prostate cancer?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"Justification: The literature suggests a positive association between the consumption of milk and dairy products and an increased risk of developing prostate cancer. This association is observed in various epidemiological studies, including a large prospective study. The risk is thought to be related to the calcium content in dairy products. However, it is important to note that the association is not statistically significant for all types of dairy products and stages of prostate cancer. The inconsistency in the data warrants further investigation."
Can inhalation with budesonide spray relieve symptoms of covid-19?,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",Yes,NEI,NEI,"The provided context discusses the use of budesonide in managing loss of smell in COVID-19 patients and its effects on various respiratory conditions such as asthma and COPD. However, it does not provide direct evidence on the efficacy of inhaled budesonide in relieving the general symptoms of COVID-19. The context primarily focuses on the impact of budesonide on airway responsiveness, inflammation, and cough in patients with asthma and COPD. Therefore, it is not possible to definitively conclude whether inhalation with budesonide spray can relieve symptoms of COVID-19 based on the provided information. Further research is needed to establish the role of budesonide in managing the symptoms of COVID-19."
"Can remedies from the iambul tree improve blood glucose control in diabetes or precursors of diabetes (""pre-diabetes"")?","['NEI', 'True', 'False']",NEI,NEI,NEI,"The context provided does not contain information on the Iambul tree or its potential effects on blood glucose control in diabetes or pre-diabetes. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer based solely on the given information. Further research and evidence are required to determine the potential benefits of remedies from the Iambul tree in managing blood glucose levels."
Does taking magnesium salts reduce the frequency and intensity of muscle cramps in pregnancy?,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",Yes,No,No,"The use of magnesium salts for the treatment of leg cramps during pregnancy is a controversial issue, as evidenced by a recent Cochrane systematic review. The study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of magnesium supplementation in treating leg cramps in pregnancy. However, the results indicate that oral magnesium supplementation during pregnancy did not reduce the occurrence and frequency of episodes of leg cramps. Although magnesium sulfate has been shown to decrease the frequency of uterine contractions, this effect does not appear to extend to leg cramps. The use of magnesium sulfate during labor in women with mild preeclampsia did not affect any component of labor but did necessitate a higher dose of oxytocin. Therefore, based on the available evidence, it cannot be concluded that taking magnesium salts reduces the frequency and intensity of muscle cramps in pregnancy."
Does wearing compression stockings on a long-haul flight prevent thrombosis (blood clots) and the associated symptoms?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"The use of compression stockings during long-haul flights has been shown to be effective in preventing flight-related deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in low- to high-risk participants. This is supported by high-quality evidence from randomized trials comparing compression stockings to no stockings in passengers on flights lasting at least four hours. The odds ratio of 0.10 (95% CI 0.04 to 0.25, p < 0.001) indicates a significant reduction in the incidence of symptomless DVT in those wearing compression stockings. Furthermore, there is moderate-quality evidence that superficial vein thrombosis may also be reduced with the use of compression stockings. In addition to preventing thrombosis, compression stockings have been shown to reduce leg edema and edema-related pain and discomfort during long-haul flights."
"Can pumpkin seeds or preparations from them help women and men with irritable bladder, bladder weakness or incontinence?","['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The findings from the study suggest that pumpkin seed oil extracts from Cucurbita maxima and Cucurbita pepo are effective for urinary disorders such as overactive bladder (OAB) in humans. The positive modulatory effect of the fluted pumpkin seed on critical markers of erectile function could be attributed to its polyphenolics and amino acid constituents. The aqueous extract of the fluted pumpkin seed significantly scavenged free radicals and inhibited PDE-5, arginase, AChE, and ACE in rats' corpus cavernosum in a concentration-dependent pattern. Therefore, this seed could be used as a functional food ingredient in the management of erectile dysfunctions and also in improving erectile functions in men. Pudendal nerve stimulation is known to have a potential modulative effect on bladder function. The dominant phenolics and amino acid constituents of this seed might be an effective nutraceutical in enhancing erections in men. Phytotherapy for lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) due to benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) is progressively demanded by patients and trusted by physicians. The bioactivity of a hydro-ethanolic extract of pumpkin seeds from the Styrian pumpkin, Cucurbita pepo L. subsp. intravesically administered PGE2 reduced bladder capacity, producing a model of overactive bladder (OAB), and sensory pudendal nerve stimulation again increased bladder capacity but also reduced voiding efficiency. Pudendal nerve stimulation is a promising treatment approach for lower urinary tract dysfunction, including symptoms of overactive bladder."
Does parents licking the pacifier protect children from allergic diseases?,"['False', 'True', 'NEI']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The study suggests that children whose parents ""cleaned"" their pacifier by sucking it were less likely to have asthma, eczema, and sensitization at 18 months of age than children whose parents did not use this cleaning technique. The protective effect against eczema development was found to be independent and additive with vaginal delivery. The salivary microbiota differed between children whose parents cleaned their pacifier by sucking it and children whose parents did not use this practice. The study suggests that parental sucking of their infant's pacifier may reduce the risk of allergy development, possibly via immune stimulation by microbes transferred to the infant via the parent's saliva."
Are oral zinc supplements effective for treating a cold (chill)?,"['True', 'False', 'NEI']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"The evidence suggests that oral zinc supplements may be effective for treating a cold. Biochemical evidence and clinical studies have shown that zinc, particularly in the form of zinc gluconate glycine lozenges, can reduce the duration and severity of cold symptoms in adults. When initiated within 24 hours of symptom onset, oral zinc is associated with a shorter duration of the common cold in healthy people. Controlled clinical trials have shown that zinc gluconate glycine lozenges can reduce symptom severity and duration of symptoms in patients with the common cold. However, the use of intranasal zinc is strongly associated with anosmia, or the loss of the sense of smell, in humans. Therefore, oral zinc supplements may be a viable option for treating a cold, but caution should be exercised with intranasal zinc."
Do acupuncture or related smoking cessation methods help you stay smoke-free for at least 6 months?,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",Yes,No,No,"The evidence from 405 subjects suggests that acupuncture may help between 5 and 15 percent of the population to stop smoking for at least six months. However, there is no consistent, bias-free evidence that acupuncture, acupressure, laser therapy, or electrostimulation are effective for smoking cessation. The lack of evidence and methodological problems mean that no firm conclusions can be drawn. Additionally, there is no clear evidence that acupuncture is effective for smoking cessation, and its effect on the urge to smoke is unclear. Therefore, it cannot be definitively stated that acupuncture or related smoking cessation methods help individuals stay smoke-free for at least six months."
Can exercise improve mental performance impaired by alcohol consumption?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The context suggests that exercise has a positive impact on mental health, including depression and anxiety, in individuals with alcohol use disorders. Acute bouts of moderate-intensity exercise have been shown to help manage mood, anxiety, and craving, thereby reducing relapse risk. The study investigating the effects of exercise on changes in mood, anxiety, and craving from pre- to post-exercise supports the role of exercise in improving mental performance impaired by alcohol consumption. Furthermore, the focus on the medial prefrontal cortex, an alcohol-vulnerable region that undergoes neuroplastic changes in response to exercise, suggests that exercise can have a positive impact on mental performance. However, more rigorous research is needed to fully understand the interactive effects of alcohol and exercise on the brain."
Does treatment with the new drug erenumab reduce the number of migraine days per month?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"The pivotal trials of erenumab in both episodic and chronic migraine demonstrated a significant reduction in monthly migraine days. Treatment with both doses of erenumab (70mg and 140mg) resulted in greater reductions in monthly migraine days compared to placebo. The treatment difference versus placebo ranged from -0.9 to -4.3 days, depending on the dose and the subgroup of patients. The results were consistent across different subgroups, including patients who had failed prior preventive treatments. Additionally, at week 12, 30% of patients in the erenumab group had a 50% or greater reduction from baseline in the mean number of monthly migraine days, compared to 14% in the placebo group. These findings suggest that erenumab is an effective preventive treatment for migraines, with the potential to significantly reduce the number of migraine days per month."
Do products with the tropical fruit mangosteen promote health?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The tropical fruit mangosteen (garcinia mangostana) has been reported to contain multiple health-promoting properties. Recent studies have shown that mangosteen has numerous health benefits, including increasing antioxidant capacity, possessing anti-inflammatory benefits, and maintaining healthy immune and gastrointestinal systems. Mangosteen is a rich source of oxygenated and prenylated xanthone derivatives, which have been implicated in its medicinal value. The bioactive compounds found in mangosteen have potential cytotoxic activity for cancer cell lines, and mangosteen extract has been shown to protect various human organs against disorders and diseases. Therefore, products containing mangosteen may promote health."
Does carnosine relieve autism symptoms in children?,"['True', 'False', 'NEI']",No,Yes,Yes,"The study found that after 8 weeks of l-carnosine supplementation, children with autism showed statistically significant improvements on the Gilliam Autism Rating Scale (total score and the behavior, socialization, and communication subscales) and the Receptive One-Word Picture Vocabulary Test. Although no significant difference was detected on the irritability subscale scores, l-carnosine add-on can improve hyperactivity/noncompliance subscales of the ABC-C rating scale in patients with ASD. However, supplementation of l-carnosine did not improve the total score of CARS2-ST, ATEC, Bears Sleep Screening Tool, and 6-GSI scores of children with ASD. The mechanism of action of l-carnosine is not well understood, but it may enhance neurologic function, perhaps in the entorhinal or temporal cortex. Further investigations are needed with more objective assessments to critically validate the effectiveness of l-carnosine on ASD children for more decisive results."
Does sugar consumption impair memory or other mental performance?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"Justification: The available evidence indicates that sugar consumption can induce cognitive dysfunction, including impairments in memory. Several studies have found that high-sugar diets can produce impaired performance in tests assessing spatial learning and memory in rats. Greater intake of total sugars has also been significantly associated with lower word list learning scores. Furthermore, consumption of high levels of sugar-sweetened beverages by adolescents may impair neurocognitive functions affecting decision-making and memory. Excessive sugar consumption among older adults has been associated with poor cognitive functions. However, longitudinal studies and clinical trials are needed to clarify the direction of causality and to investigate the underlying mechanism."
Do products made from red mold rice have fewer side effects than cholesterol-lowering drugs called statins???,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",No,No,No,"The evidence suggests that products made from red yeast rice, also known as red mold rice, contain natural statins and have similar lipid-lowering effects as synthetic statins. However, the safety of red yeast rice in clinical practice is still incompletely characterized, and the variability in monacolin K content makes it difficult to predict or understand dose-related efficacy and side-effect risks. Therefore, it cannot be concluded that products made from red yeast rice have fewer side effects than cholesterol-lowering drugs called statins."
"Do Waveex and similar products reduce exposure to electromagnetic fields, for example when using a cell phone or smartphone?","['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"Recent studies have shown that electromagnetic fields (EMFs) emitted by mobile phones can have effects on brain activity, well-being, attention, and neurological parameters in mobile phone users. The use of mobile phone chips, such as Waveex, has been found to significantly reduce the effects of EMFs on electroencephalographic (EEG) brain activity and attentional performance. Electromagnetic shielding fabrics, produced as conductive nonwoven textile surfaces, have also been shown to improve oxidant-antioxidant status and tp53 expression in electromagnetic waves exposed zebrafish embryos. These findings suggest that products like Waveex can reduce exposure to EMFs when using a cell phone or smartphone."
Does less than 7h of sleep daily increase mental performance?,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",No,No,No,"The context suggests that a sleep duration of 7-8 hours is optimal for reducing chronic disease risk and maintaining cognitive performance. Sleep laboratory studies have found that restricted sleep duration, including less than 7 hours, leads to worse short-term cognition, particularly memory. Furthermore, perceived sleep-related difficulties are more likely among individuals reporting less than 7 hours of sleep compared to those reporting 7-9 hours. Research has also associated short sleep duration with obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Therefore, it can be concluded that less than 7 hours of sleep daily does not increase mental performance."
Does sugar substitution increase the risk of developing or dying from cancer?,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",NEI,NEI,NEI,"The context provided does not directly address the question of whether sugar substitution increases the risk of developing or dying from cancer. However, it does suggest that high sugar intake may increase cancer risk by promoting insulin-glucose dysregulation, oxidative stress, inflammation, and body adiposity. It also mentions that a parallel increase in sugar intake may facilitate carcinogenesis by promoting hyperglycaemia. In contrast, the context indicates that there was no association between frequency of consuming sugar-sweetened soft drinks and the risk of certain cancers, but an unexpected positive association was observed for consumption of artificially sweetened soft drinks. Therefore, based on the information provided, it is not possible to definitively answer the question of whether sugar substitution increases the risk of developing or dying from cancer."
Does MONTHLY administered HIGH-dose atropine (1%) sustainably inhibit the progression of myopia in children?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",Yes,No,No,"The context does not provide sufficient evidence to conclude that monthly administered high-dose atropine (1%) sustainably inhibits the progression of myopia in children. The studies mentioned in the context primarily focus on the efficacy and safety of low-dose atropine (0.01%-0.5%) in slowing myopia progression. While there is evidence that high-dose atropine (1%) has been used to retard the progression of simple childhood myopia, the context does not provide information on the sustainability of this effect with monthly administration. Therefore, it cannot be definitively stated that monthly administered high-dose atropine (1%) sustainably inhibits the progression of myopia in children."
"Can exercise prevent premature deaths from heart attacks, strokes, heart failure, and pre-diabetes as effectively as medication?","['True', 'False', 'NEI']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"Justification: The provided context suggests that exercise can effectively prevent premature deaths from heart attacks, strokes, heart failure, and pre-diabetes. Exercise has been shown to improve cardiovascular efficiency, arrest or reverse atherosclerosis, and reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease, obesity, and diabetes. Exercise is also known to lower the risk for cardiovascular disease and mortality. Although there are limited clinical data to support the use of exercise training as a means to reduce mortality and morbidity in patients with heart failure, current guidelines state that exercise is beneficial. Exercise is one of the commonly recommended interventions/preventions for hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and cardiovascular disease. However, it is important to note that exercise can cause sudden cardiac death in patients with pre-existing cardiac conditions. Therefore, it is recommended that patients with pre-existing cardiac conditions consult with their healthcare provider before starting an exercise program."
"Can the state of health be assessed as reliably with a ""cell check"" analysis as with other diagnostic tests (for example, blood or urine analyses)?","['NEI', 'True', 'False']",NEI,NEI,NEI,"The provided context does not explicitly mention ""cell check"" analysis, making it challenging to definitively compare its reliability to other diagnostic tests such as blood or urine analyses. However, the context does highlight the importance of laboratory measurements in routine health checkups, which can involve various analytes in the blood, urine, and breath samples. The performance of a medical diagnostic test is often evaluated by comparing the outcome to the patient's true disease state. The context also emphasizes the value of combining tests for a more accurate determination of the patient's health status. Therefore, while the reliability of a ""cell check"" analysis cannot be directly compared, it is reasonable to infer that its performance would also depend on its ability to accurately reflect the patient's health status, similar to other diagnostic tests."
Is screening by optical coherence tomography superior to conventional examinations for the early detection of diabetic macular edema?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",No,Yes,Yes,"Justification: The context suggests that optical coherence tomography (OCT) has been systematically reviewed for its sensitivity and specificity in diagnosing macular edema due to diabetic retinopathy. It has been found to perform well compared to conventional examinations such as fundus stereophotography or biomicroscopy. OCT has been used in a screening and treatment method for fovea-threatening diabetic macular edema (DME) and has contributed to the early diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy and blindness prevention. Furthermore, OCT angiography (OCT-A) has improved the ability to detect subclinical and early clinically visible microvascular changes in patients with diabetes mellitus. The sensitivity and specificity of spectral-domain OCT (SD-OCT) for the detection of fovea-threatening DME have been determined. These findings suggest that screening by OCT is superior to conventional examinations for the early detection of diabetic macular edema."
Can butterbur prevent migraine attacks?,"['True', 'False', 'NEI']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"The context indicates that butterbur has been studied for its potential as an efficient and well-tolerated migraine preventive in children and adolescents. Two randomized and placebo-controlled trials with a total of 289 migraine patients have demonstrated the efficacy and safety of a special butterbur root extract in the reduction of migraine attacks in adults. The results and low rate of adverse events in this open prospective migraine prevention study in children and adolescents are similar to the results of two multicenter placebo-controlled butterbur studies in adults. The mechanism of the anti-migraine action of extracts of butterbur is also mentioned. Therefore, it can be concluded that butterbur has the potential to prevent migraine attacks."
Does taking preparations with fenugreek extract improve sex life or satisfaction with it?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The context suggests that fenugreek extract has been shown to have a significant effect on total serum testosterone levels in males. This is supported by clinical trials that have demonstrated the androgenic and anabolic effects of different types of glycosides extract of fenugreek in males. Furthermore, the study objective was to examine whether a fenugreek seed extract would improve healthy men's aging male symptoms, health-related quality of life (HRQOL), grip strength, and anxiety. The results of the study showed that fenugreek supplementation was an effective nutritional intervention for improving aging male symptoms, anxiety levels, grip strength, and aspects of HRQOL in healthy recreationally active men. Additionally, people use fenugreek as a supplement to energize, bolster, and enhance sexual ability. Therefore, it can be inferred that taking preparations with fenugreek extract may improve sex life or satisfaction with it."
Does regular HPV testing in addition to the recommended Pap smear detect more precancerous lesions than just the Pap smear alone?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"Regular HPV testing in conjunction with the recommended Pap smear has been shown to detect more precancerous lesions than just the Pap smear alone. This is due to the fact that HPV testing is more sensitive for the detection of cervical precancer and cancer than cervical cytology. The addition of high-risk HPV testing to a cervical smear may improve the efficacy of cervical cancer screening programmes, the triage of women with equivocal or borderline pap smears, and the monitoring of women who have been treated for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 (CIN 3). Several randomized controlled studies have shown that screening for cervical cancer using HPV detection can be more effective than cytology alone. Primary HPV-testing has been shown to provide a superior detection of women at risk of cervical (pre)cancer compared to cytology-based screening. Testing for HPV has been shown to increase the sensitivity and negative predictive value for detection of high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN2+), either when used in conjunction with pap cytology testing or alone."
Does electro-acupuncture on the ear help against pain?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"The context suggests that electro-acupuncture on the ear, also known as auricular electroacupuncture, has been shown to have a significant effect in reducing pain. Studies have demonstrated that both somatic acupuncture and somatic plus ear acupuncture have a positive effect in reducing pain. Electro-acupuncture of the outer ear has been found to be an effective therapeutic option for pain relief. Patients receiving auricular acupuncture reported lower pain scores than those who did not. The results of a prospective, randomized, double-blind, controlled study showed that auricular electroacupuncture relieved pain more effectively than conventional manual auricular acupuncture in chronic low back pain patients. The mechanism of action is thought to be related to the enhancement of acetylcholine secretion, which has anti-inflammatory effects, and the increase of acupuncture analgesia through electrical stimulation of acupuncture points."
Does cinnamon lower blood sugar levels in diabetes?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",No,Yes,Yes,"The use of cinnamon has been found to have a positive effect on blood glucose control in patients with type 2 diabetes. Studies have shown that cinnamon supplementation can significantly improve blood glucose control and lower fasting serum glucose, triacylglycerol, and LDL and total cholesterol concentrations. The cinnamon extract has also been found to have a moderate effect in reducing fasting plasma glucose concentrations in diabetic patients with poor glycemic control. While definitive conclusions cannot be drawn regarding the use of cinnamon as an antidiabetic therapy, it does possess antihyperglycemic properties and potential to reduce postprandial blood glucose levels."
Does taking hyaluronic acid in capsule form improve the symptoms of knee osteoarthritis?,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",NEI,NEI,NEI,"The context provided exclusively discusses the intra-articular injection of hyaluronic acid for the treatment of knee osteoarthritis. The evidence presented supports the clinical effectiveness and safety of hyaluronic acid injections for pain relief and function improvement in patients with knee osteoarthritis. However, there is no information regarding the efficacy of taking hyaluronic acid in capsule form for improving the symptoms of knee osteoarthritis. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer based solely on the provided context. Further research is needed to evaluate the potential benefits of oral hyaluronic acid supplementation for knee osteoarthritis."
Do light drinks promote obesity?,"['True', 'False', 'NEI']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The consumption of low-calorie beverages has been linked to increased body weight gain in some epidemiological studies. This association is attributed to the relatively low levels of satiety induced by these beverages, which may not adequately compensate for the energy intake from the beverages. Artificial sweeteners present in low-calorie beverages could induce appetite increase, possibly due to an ambiguous psychobiological signal that confounds the appetite's regulatory mechanisms, promoting overeating and ultimately leading to weight gain. Despite their low-calorie content, the consumption of low-calorie beverages has been increasing worldwide, mainly due to their sweet taste without adding significant calories to the diet. However, it is still controversial whether moderate amounts of alcohol represent a risk factor for weight gain and obesity."
Does the osteoporosis drug teriparatide increase the risk of bone cancer as a side effect?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The context suggests that teriparatide, a therapeutic agent used for osteoporosis, has been reported to increase the incidences of bone neoplasms, such as osteosarcoma, in Fischer 344 rats when administered subcutaneously for a long term. The osteoblastogenic effect of teriparatide might induce this condition, and the development of osteosarcoma in Sprague-Dawley rats has been shown to depend on the dose level and treatment duration with teriparatide. Rat studies using 3-60 times the approved human dose have shown an association between teriparatide and an increased risk of osteosarcoma. However, it is important to note that the non-carcinogenic dose level following 2-year daily administration has not been established, and adequate clinical trials have not been conducted to assess the efficacy of teriparatide for reducing the risk of hip fracture."
Do preparations with humic acids help with diseases or complaints of the stomach and intestines?,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",NEI,NEI,NEI,"The context does not provide information on the effects of preparations with humic acids on diseases or complaints of the stomach and intestines. However, it does discuss the potential therapeutic roles of various food-derived ingredients and nutrients in gastrointestinal disorders. The ability of antacids and cholestyramine to bind bile acids is noted as potentially valuable in treating reflux gastritis. The context also mentions the use of butyrate, a short-chain fatty acid, in providing symptomatic relief for colonic diseases and its effect on altering the gut microbiota of IBD patients. The use of nutrients for pharmacotherapy is also discussed as a recent advance in treating gastrointestinal disorders. Despite these findings, the context does not provide information on the specific effects of humic acids on gastrointestinal health."
Is fasting effective and safe in the long term for arthritis and other diseases?,"['True', 'False', 'NEI']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"Fasting has been shown to be clinically beneficial in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and osteoarthritis (OA). It has been observed to significantly improve joint pain, swelling, and other arthritic symptoms in patients with RA. The anti-inflammatory effect of fasting is of significant interest, and it has been found to decrease lipid peroxidation and increase total antioxidant capacity in plasma. Furthermore, fasting has been shown to have a beneficial modulating effect on blood lipids and glucose regulation.

     In addition to its benefits for arthritis, fasting has been found to be effective in reducing metabolic disorders and age-related diseases. It has been shown to improve health and general well-being, as well as have cytoprotective effects. Animal studies have also suggested that fasting may increase longevity and alter biological parameters related to longevity.

     While the long-term safety of fasting for arthritis and other diseases has not been extensively studied, the available evidence suggests that it may be a useful therapeutic intervention for the management of several chronic, non-infectious diseases. However, it is important to note that fasting should be done under the supervision of a healthcare professional, as it may not be suitable for everyone."
Are cannabis or substances derived from cannabis effective and safe anti-cancer agents?,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",NEI,NEI,NEI,"Cannabis and its derivatives, including delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (δ(9)-THC) and cannabidiol (CBD), have demonstrated anti-neoplastic effects in preclinical studies involving various cancer cells and some animal models. However, the available literature on the use of cannabis and cannabinoid-based medicines in palliative oncology does not provide conclusive evidence regarding their effectiveness and safety as anti-cancer agents. While cannabis use is prevalent among patients with cancer-related symptoms, further research is needed to establish its role in cancer treatment. The potential adverse effects of cannabis and cannabis-like molecules should also be considered when evaluating their therapeutic potential. In summary, the current evidence is insufficient to definitively answer whether cannabis or substances derived from cannabis are effective and safe anti-cancer agents."
Can Artemisia tea cure malaria as well as drugs?,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",NEI,NEI,NEI,"Artemisia annua tea has been shown to be an effective treatment for malaria in various clinical trials, with artemisinin plasma concentrations after intake of the tea being sufficient for clinical effects. However, it is important to note that the efficacy of Artemisia annua tea has not been investigated in vitro to the same extent as modern artemisinin drugs. Additionally, while the tea has been shown to have antimalarial effects, it is not recommended as an equivalent substitute for modern artemisinin drugs in malaria therapy. Therefore, it is not possible to definitively state that Artemisia annua tea can cure malaria as well as drugs."
Is it true that lowering cholesterol does not reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease?,"['False', 'NEI', 'True']",No,No,No,"The reduction of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) has been associated with a decrease in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Trial evidence shows that effective lowering of serum total cholesterol and particularly of LDL cholesterol is important for the prevention of total mortality, coronary artery disease mortality, and major coronary events. Clinical and angiographic intervention trials have now ascertained that lowering LDL cholesterol is effective in prevention and in secondary treatment of coronary atherosclerosis. However, it is uncertain whether pharmacological reductions in very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDLs) and their component triglyceride and cholesterol could reduce residual risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events among individuals in whom LDL-C has been adequately lowered. Additionally, specific genetic variants that raise HDL-C levels are not clearly associated with reduced risk of coronary heart disease. There is no evidence yet that lowering LDL and raising HDL alleviate that risk."
Does taking probiotics during pregnancy and early life protect children from atopic dermatitis?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",Yes,Yes,Yes,The meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials indicates that probiotic use during pregnancy and early life decreases the incidence of atopic dermatitis in infants and young children. Maternal probiotic supplementation has been shown to prevent the development of atopic dermatitis in the offspring. The results of the meta-analysis provide evidence in support of a moderate role of probiotics in the prevention of atopic dermatitis and IgE-associated atopic dermatitis in infants. Consumption of probiotic milk in pregnancy was associated with a slightly reduced relative risk of atopic eczema at 6 months and of rhinoconjunctivitis between 18 and 36 months compared with no consumption during pregnancy. The meta-analysis demonstrated that probiotic use decreased the incidence of atopic dermatitis. Pooled analysis indicated that probiotics administered prenatally and postnatally could reduce the risk of atopy and food hypersensitivity.
Can homeopathic remedies relieve colds in children??,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",No,NEI,NEI,"The context provided suggests that homeopathic remedies, such as a homeopathic syrup, have been studied for their potential to relieve cold symptoms in children. Some studies have reported positive results, such as the reduction of symptom severity and the exhibition of anti-inflammatory and pain-relieving qualities in children with acute viral tonsillitis. However, other studies have not found convincing evidence of the efficacy of homeopathic remedies for treating common cold symptoms in children, and there is little evidence that the decongestant, antihistamine, or cough suppressant medications commonly used to treat cold symptoms in preschool children are effective. Therefore, it is not possible to definitively conclude that homeopathic remedies can relieve colds in children based on the information provided."
Can music therapy help stroke victims with other problems???,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"Music therapy has been shown to have a positive impact on various aspects of stroke rehabilitation, beyond motor function. Studies have indicated that music-supported therapy (MST) can lead to improvements in cognitive and psychosocial functions in chronic stroke patients. Incorporating patient-selected music with in-patient physical rehabilitation has been found to be a feasible intervention for patients with acute stroke. Furthermore, music therapy as a clinical intervention has been demonstrated to improve mood states in various populations, although empirical evidence with participants with neurological impairments is still emerging. Therefore, it can be inferred that music therapy has the potential to help stroke victims with other problems, such as cognitive and psychosocial issues."
"Can ozone therapy, in which autologous blood is treated with ozone and recycled, favorably influence the course of COVID-19 disease?","['NEI', 'True', 'False']",NEI,NEI,NEI,"The context provided does not contain information on the effect of ozone therapy on COVID-19 disease. However, it does indicate that ozone therapy has been reported to have therapeutic effects in various pathological conditions, including ischemic, infectious, autoimmune, and neoplastic disorders. Ozone therapy has been shown to activate the antioxidant system, improve blood circulation, and enhance oxygen delivery to tissues. It has also been used as an adjuvant therapy in the treatment of several disorders. Nevertheless, further research is needed to determine the potential benefits of ozone therapy in the context of COVID-19 disease."
Can phthalates cause diabetes?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"Epidemiological studies have found a correlation between circulating phthalate levels and type 2 diabetes. Phthalates, such as di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), have been shown to cause adverse effects on glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity in several cell models and epidemiological studies. Animal studies have also indicated that phthalates are capable of disrupting endocrine signaling, which can impact glucose homeostasis. However, direct evidence supporting a causal role for exposure to phthalates in type 2 diabetes is lacking. Nonetheless, human exposure to phthalates is associated with increased oxidative stress, which mediates the development of type 2 diabetes. Therefore, it is plausible that phthalates may contribute to the development of diabetes."
Can an extract of Desmodium promote liver health or relieve other ailments?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The scientific literature supports the use of plant extracts for the treatment of liver diseases. In particular, the extract of Desmodium has been found to have a significant hepatoprotective effect against liver injury. The extract has been shown to ameliorate liver injury and suppress the production of inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α) and interferon-γ (IFN-γ) in concanavalin A-induced hepatitis. Additionally, the extract has been found to inhibit hepatocyte death, promote p53-related regeneration, and regulate lipid homeostatic imbalance and acetaminophen transformation. These findings suggest that Desmodium extract may be an effective treatment for liver diseases and other ailments."
Does religion promote mental health?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"Justification: The context suggests that religion and spirituality can promote mental health through positive religious coping, community and support, and positive beliefs. Research has shown a consistent relationship between religion and better mental health as well as greater social support. Religion has been found to have a positive impact on well-being and to play an important role in coping with stressful life events. However, it is important to note that religion can also be damaging to mental health through negative religious coping, misunderstanding and miscommunication, and negative beliefs."
Can antibiotic-resistant germs from animal husbandry be transferred to humans?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"The context indicates that antibiotic-resistant bacteria and resistance genes can be transmitted from animals to humans through direct contact or via the food chain. This transfer may occur through the consumption of contaminated food products, direct contact with food-producing animals, or environmental spread. The use of antibiotics in animal husbandry selects for drug-resistant microorganisms, which can then be spread to humans. The intensive use of antimicrobials in animals may promote the fixation of antimicrobial resistance genes in bacteria, which may be zoonotic or capable of transferring these genes to human-adapted pathogens or to human gut microbiota via direct contact, food, or the environment. There are several examples of transfer of resistant bacteria or bacterial resistance genes from animals to humans via the food chain. Therefore, it is concluded that antibiotic-resistant germs from animal husbandry can be transferred to humans."

Does lavender scent help with sleep disorders?,"['True', 'False', 'NEI']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The context indicates that lavender has been shown to increase the percentage of deep or slow-wave sleep in both men and women. Additionally, lavender and sleep hygiene together, and sleep hygiene alone to a lesser degree, improved sleep quality for college students with self-reported sleep issues, with an effect remaining at follow-up. Lavender aromatherapy has also been shown to improve sleep in a variety of clinical settings, including an intermediate care unit. The lavender and sleep hygiene group demonstrated better sleep quality at post-intervention and two-week follow-up. The positive impact of lavender on sleep has been demonstrated in several studies, including an increase in blood melatonin levels in both older adult men and women. The role lavender plays in the treatment of insomnia might be accomplished through the regulation of the key targets adrb1 and hla-drb1."
Is it safe to take preparations containing unsaponifiable components of avocado and soybean oils (ASU)?,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",Yes,NEI,NEI,"The safety of preparations containing unsaponifiable components of avocado and soybean oils (ASU) is not definitively established. While ASU has been reported to exert beneficial effects in the treatment of periodontal and osteoarticular diseases, and has shown some promise for osteoarthritis, there is no clear evidence regarding its safety. The text mentions that virtually nothing is known of the safety of this oil for humans. Therefore, it is not possible to definitively state whether it is safe to take preparations containing ASU."
Can treatment with tea tree oil relieve pimples (acne)?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"The use of tea tree oil for the treatment of acne vulgaris has been suggested by a study, which aimed to evaluate the clinical evidence on its use for treating acne. Tea tree oil is a popular antimicrobial agent and is recommended for the treatment of acne vulgaris, a disease of the pilosebaceous unit. Topical 5% tea tree oil has been found to be an effective treatment for mild to moderate acne vulgaris. Tea tree oil possesses broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity and is increasingly used for skin problems. Over-the-counter acne treatments containing tea tree oil are widely available and are a common choice amongst those self-treating their acne. The essential tea tree oil has been widely used in modern medicine and cosmetics in recent years, and several published studies have demonstrated its antibacterial activity. However, it is important to note that oxidation of tea tree oil can result in degradation products, such as ascaridole, which may cause allergic contact dermatitis. Therefore, it is recommended to use tea tree oil with caution and to consult with a healthcare professional before use."

However, the context does indicate that xylitol has been shown to reduce the risk of dental caries when used in food, chewing gum, and lozenges. The context also mentions that xylitol is a well-known anticaries agent and has been used for the prevention and treatment of dental caries. Therefore, it is plausible that toothpaste containing xylitol could potentially reduce the risk of caries, but further research is needed to confirm this."
Can maggots accelerate the healing of chronic wounds compared to conventional treatment?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",No,Yes,Yes,"The context suggests that maggots can indeed accelerate the healing of chronic wounds compared to conventional treatment. Maggot therapy, through its debridement, disinfection, and healing enhancement properties, has been used successfully to treat chronic, long-standing, infected wounds that have failed to respond to conventional treatment. The medicinal use of maggots for the biological debridement of chronic wounds is increasing worldwide due to its efficacy, safety, and simplicity. Maggots promote wound healing by removing necrotic tissue, countering bacterial infection, and activating wound-associated cells. The use of maggot therapy is experiencing a revival in the treatment of problem wounds, and there is renewed interest in its use for the healing of chronic wounds."

Are there differences in hair removal effectiveness between IPL and diode laser?,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",No,Yes,Yes,".

     Both diode laser and intense pulsed light (IPL) are effective for hair removal, but studies suggest that there are differences in their efficacy. The diode laser has been shown to be more effective in reducing the number of hair shafts, although it may be more painful than IPL. IPL, on the other hand, has been found to have less side effects and higher satisfaction scores. A comparative study of axillary hair removal performed by the diode laser and IPL in 21 females found that both methods significantly reduced the number of hair shafts. However, a study comparing a high average power 810 nm diode laser with a single-pass vacuum-assisted technique found that the diode laser was more effective. Another study comparing a shr mode IPL system with alexandrite and Nd: YAG lasers for leg hair reduction found that both laser and IPL reduced the hair count substantially, but the laser was statistically significant at p=0.028, while IPL was not. Nevertheless, based on patient satisfaction rate, the authors recommended using IPL for hair removal. Overall, while both methods are effective, the diode laser may be more effective in reducing hair, while IPL may have less side effects and higher satisfaction scores."
Can carbon dioxide in mineral water and other sparkling drinks damage teeth or cause tooth decay?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The consumption of carbonated beverages, including mineral water and other sparkling drinks, can indeed contribute to dental erosion and tooth decay. The low pH levels found in these beverages, such as lime juice and lime soda, can cause erosion of the enamel surface and cementum of both deciduous and permanent teeth. The erosive tooth surface loss due to acidic soft-drinks has been well documented. The study also found that carbonated soft drinks, including those containing caffeine, have been associated with more aggressive forms of dental decay. The protective mechanisms in the oral cavity can neutralize the acids present in these beverages, but continuous usage can lead to irreversible damage to the tooth structure. The decrease in hardness of enamel of permanent teeth was found to be maximum for teeth immersed in carbonated beverages."
Does regular gargling with antimicrobial mouthwashes protect against contracting coronavirus? Does it help get better faster if you have Covid 19 disease?,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",NEI,NEI,NEI,"Justification: The provided context does not mention the use of antimicrobial mouthwashes as a preventive measure against contracting coronavirus or as a means to improve recovery from Covid-19. Therefore, there is not enough information to definitively answer the question."
Do electric toothbrushes protect oral health better than manual brushes?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"The evidence from multiple studies indicates that electric toothbrushes are more effective than manual toothbrushes in maintaining oral health. Electric toothbrushes have been shown to be more efficient in removing plaque and improving gingival health, particularly in individuals unfamiliar with electric brushes. The results of these studies demonstrate that electric toothbrushes are more effective in reducing supragingival plaque levels, either before or after brushing, compared to manual toothbrushes. Furthermore, electric toothbrushes have been found to be significantly more effective in reducing plaque index, gingival index, and bleeding index compared to manual toothbrushes. The use of both electric toothbrushes during the treatment phase progressively reduced plaque and gingivitis scores at each successive examination. Therefore, it can be concluded that electric toothbrushes are more effective in protecting oral health than manual brushes."
,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"Justification: Various researchers have reported the anti-inflammatory activity of aqueous extracts of devil's claw (Harpagophytum procumbens). Preparations made from the secondary tubers of devil's claw have been successfully used in patients with rheumatic diseases, including osteoarthritis and low back pain. An open clinical study suggests that devil's claw extract has a clinically beneficial effect in the treatment of arthrosis of the hip or knee. The iridoid glycoside, harpagoside, found in the root extracts of devil's claw, has been found to be effective in the treatment of degenerative rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, and other inflammatory disorders."
Do green tea products provide effective and safe support for weight loss?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",No,Yes,Yes,"Green tea products have been found to provide effective support for weight loss, as indicated by small clinical studies and epidemiological evidence. The beneficial effects of green tea extracts, which include polyphenols and polysaccharides, have been reported to suppress body weight increase and fat accumulation. Intervention studies have also shown that green tea may decrease blood glucose levels and increase satiety. The safety of green tea products has been established, although there have been isolated case reports of hepatotoxicity possibly related to a specific extract in pill or beverage form. However, it is important to note that the effective dose of green tea without pronounced influence on protein availability is unknown, and different outcomes of the effect of green tea on weight loss and weight maintenance have been reported in studies with subjects differing in ethnicity and habitual caffeine intake."
Can the consumption of caffeine during pregnancy harm the unborn child?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"Caffeine consumption during pregnancy has been linked to various adverse effects on fetal development and pregnancy outcomes. These include in utero growth restriction, spontaneous abortion, decreased fertility, delayed conception, early spontaneous abortions, and low birth weight. Chronic caffeine exposure during pregnancy has been shown to affect fetal growth, and high-maternal caffeine intake may be harmful for perinatal outcomes and future child health. Caffeine intake during pregnancy has also been associated with cognitive dysfunction in offspring, as it affects fetal brain development and results in persistent cognitive deficits. The Food and Drug Administration of the United States has urged pregnant women to avoid caffeine-containing food and drugs, if possible, or consume them sparingly."
Does garlic protect against a cold (chill)??,"['NEI', 'False', 'True']",NEI,NEI,NEI,"The provided context does not contain specific information regarding the protective effects of garlic against a cold or chill. However, it does mention that garlic has been used for its multiple physiological activities, including anti-inflammatory properties, and has been suggested to have both cancer-preventive potential and significant enhancing effects on the immune system. It is also known that garlic contains chemical constituents with antibiotic, lipid-lowering, detoxification, and other medicinal effects in the body. Despite these properties, the context does not provide sufficient information to conclude whether garlic protects against a cold or chill."
,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The beneficial impact of spermidine intake on memory functions has been demonstrated in both animal models and humans. Spermidine has been suggested as a preventive approach to delay age-related cognitive decline and possibly even Alzheimer's disease (AD). In a pilot trial, nutritional spermidine was associated with a positive impact on memory performance in older adults with subjective cognitive decline. Higher dietary spermidine intake was positively associated with several structural brain measures, irrespective of the presence of cognitive decline. Spermidine levels decline with aging, and a possible connection between reduced endogenous spermidine concentrations and age-related deterioration has been suggested. Spermidine preserves mitochondrial function, exhibits anti-inflammatory properties, and prevents stem cell senescence. Nutritional intervention with spermidine can prevent memory loss in aging model organisms. These findings suggest that spermidine supplements or a spermidine-rich diet may reduce the risk of Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia, and may also help with existing dementia."
"Can supplemental tryptophan, taken as a dietary supplement or with food, help with depression?","['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The evidence suggests that supplemental tryptophan, taken as a dietary supplement or with food, can help with depression. Tryptophan is a precursor to serotonin, a neurotransmitter that is often found in low levels in individuals with depression. The administration of tryptophan can boost serotonin neurotransmission, which can produce therapeutically important effects in serotonin deficiency disorders. Tryptophan has been employed as an adjunct with tricyclic antidepressants and monoamine oxidase inhibitors to increase their effectiveness in treating affective disorders. The intake of tryptophan is closely related to the suppression of depressed and anxious moods. Although a definitive relationship between dietary tryptophan intake and depressive symptoms has not been established, several studies have shown that tryptophan intake is associated with a lower prevalence of depressive symptoms in young women. Tryptophan has been introduced in the treatment of depression and insomnia, and its clinical effectiveness must be considered with caution. However, it has been shown to benefit patients with depression at the beginning of treatment with fluoxetine."
Do snoring sprays or gargle solutions help against snoring?,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The study suggests that snoring sprays or gargle solutions can help against snoring. In a double-blind study, a significant reduction in snoring was reported by bed partners of snoring volunteers who used either an essential oil spray or gargle formulation. Additionally, the use of nasal budesonide in snorers was found to increase nasal breathing epochs, modestly decrease snoring frequency, and increase rapid eye movement sleep. The study also evaluated the effect of nasal budesonide on breathing route pattern and snoring, and found that it was associated with a decrease in oral/oro-nasal breathing epochs and a concomitant increase in nasal breathing epochs, as well as a decrease in snoring frequency."
Do braces treatments have preventive medical benefits in addition to aesthetic ones?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The context suggests that brace treatments have been used as a vital non-surgical procedure for immature adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) patients with a mild or moderate curve. The more often patients wear their braces to the prescribed tightness and length of wear each day, the better the treatment outcome. Some clinical studies have shown the efficacy of brace treatment is correlated to how the brace has been worn. Braces and splints can be useful for acute injuries, chronic conditions, and the prevention of injury. Clinicians have believed braces improve the outcome of ACL reconstruction by improving extension, decreasing pain and graft strain, and providing protection from excessive force. Patients using a brace will have superior outcomes than those using a sleeve. Brace treatment is effective even in the long-term for the treatment of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis. A discrete choice experiment was designed in which patients had to choose between hypothetical brace treatment profiles that differed in following 4 treatment attributes: effectiveness, visibility, discomfort, and treatment duration. These results are important if RCTs would conclusively establish that bracing is effective, and show directions for the further technical development of braces to increase the compliance with brace treatment. A smart brace has been developed to control the brace wear tightness with the expectation that appropriately worn braces will improve outcomes. However, the main question posted here is how to improve the efficiency of braces to control the scoliotic curve or to decrease its progression. Insight into patients' preferences for (characteristics of) brace treatment will be useful for future trials and for the development of braces that may optimize compliance with brace treatment."
"In case of osteoarthritis of the knee, does rubbing DMSO bring less pain and more mobility than the recognized painkiller diclofenac???","['NEI', 'False', 'True']",NEI,No,No,"The study primarily focuses on the efficacy and safety of topical diclofenac sodium 1% gel in managing osteoarthritis pain. The patients were randomly assigned to apply one of three solutions to their painful knee for four weeks: a topical diclofenac solution (1.5% wt/wt diclofenac sodium in a carrier containing dimethyl sulfoxide [DMSO]), a vehicle-control solution (the carrier containing DMSO but no diclofenac), and a placebo solution (a modified carrier with a token amount of DMSO for blinding purposes but no diclofenac). The results indicate that the topical diclofenac solution was significantly more effective in reducing pain and improving physical function than the vehicle-control and placebo solutions. However, the study does not directly compare the efficacy of DMSO alone to diclofenac in reducing pain and improving mobility in osteoarthritis of the knee."
Is there a connection between ADHD and neurodermatitis?,"['True', 'False', 'NEI']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"Justification: Epidemiologic evidence indicates a relevant association between atopic dermatitis (AD) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Atopic dermatitis, also known as neurodermatitis, is associated with increased odds of ADHD in both adults and children. The co-occurrence of ADHD with AD has been well described in recent association studies. AD is a chronic inflammatory skin disease with characteristics such as pruritus, psychological stress, and sleep disturbance, all of which might increase the risk of ADHD. The link between ADHD and other neurodevelopmental disorders is substantially driven by unique genetic influences. In multivariate models, AD was associated with ADHD in both children and adults."
Are there health benefits to screening the general population for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) as a precaution?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",No,Yes,Yes,"The evidence supports the use of a community-screening program to identify and help modify risk factors for COPD. Screening spirometry might help identify patients with COPD at an earlier stage. The SEARCH1 study assessed whether screening using the COPD-PS questionnaire and a handheld spirometer can increase yields of COPD diagnosis and respiratory-related clinician actions in primary care. Prescreening with a COPD-6 screening device has been shown to facilitate early detection of COPD in primary care. There is evidence that lung cancer screening in this population is effective and can potentially reduce mortality. However, until such a study has shown convincing results, and has been followed by a cost-benefit analysis in favor of screening, screening for pre-clinical COPD in general practice should not be recommended."
