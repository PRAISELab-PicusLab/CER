Can ginkgo extract improve mental performance in dementia patients?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"The Ginkgo biloba extract (GBE) has been shown to have beneficial effects in improving cognitive function and alleviating symptoms of dementia in multiple clinical trials. The extract, particularly EGb 761, has been found to enhance performance in patients with cognitive impairment, including those with Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia. The chronic administration of Ginkgo has been shown to have memory-enhancing effects in both healthy subjects and patients with dementia. The use of Ginkgo extract in treating dementia is based on positive results from good-quality placebo-controlled studies. The extract is reported to improve symptoms associated with cognitive deficits, such as decreased memory performance, lack of concentration, and decreased alertness. The herbal remedy Ginkgo biloba is promoted as a treatment for memory loss and dementia. However, the pharmacological mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of Ginkgo remain unclear."
Is the success of conventional treatment of a herniated disc equivalent to that of disc surgery?,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",Yes,No,No,"The success of conventional treatment of a herniated disc is not equivalent to that of disc surgery. While complete improvement can occur with nonoperative treatment, the standard treatment for lumbar disc herniation is lumbar disc removal. Conservative discectomy has been shown to result in a higher incidence of recurrent disc herniation, although it may result in shorter operative time, quicker return to work, and a decreased incidence of long-term recurrent low back pain. The prevailing percutaneous treatment options for herniated non-contained lumbar discs have not reliably achieved the same good results as the conventional microsurgical techniques. Clinical results in patients reoperated on for contralateral recurrent lumbar disc herniation compare favorably with those reported after primary discectomy."
Does Chaga mushroom help against cancer or other diseases?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The Chaga mushroom (Inonotus obliquus) has been used in traditional medicine for cancer treatment and has been indicated to have potential anticancer properties. Studies have suggested that Chaga mushroom extracts may act as a natural anticancer product by preventing the inhibition of gap junctional intercellular communication (GJIC) through the inactivation of ERK1/2 and p38 MAP kinase. Chaga mushroom extracts have also been shown to prevent the inhibition of GJIC by TPA, a promoter of cancer. Additionally, Chaga mushroom extracts have been evaluated for their potential to protect against oxidative damage to DNA in human lymphocytes. The possible role of Chaga mushroom as a therapeutic agent in addressing the pathogenesis of cancer has also been suggested. However, further research is needed to fully understand the therapeutic effect of Chaga mushroom on cancer and its molecular mechanisms of action."
Do milk or dairy products promote bladder cancer?,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",No,No,No,"The available evidence suggests that there is no or limited evidence that milk consumption affects the risk of bladder cancer. Total dairy intake was not significantly associated with risk of bladder cancer, and there was no overall association of genetically predicted milk consumption with bladder cancer. The intake of milk or cheese was not associated with bladder cancer risk. However, it is important to note that findings from epidemiologic studies of the effect of dairy foods on the risk of bladder cancer have been inconsistent."
Does UV light reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The context suggests that UV light may have a favorable impact on blood pressure and vascular health, and may help to prevent certain autoimmune disorders. This is supported by evidence that UV light can lead to the release of nitric oxide from the skin and decrease blood pressure. Furthermore, UV radiation, by increasing body levels of vitamin D, is hypothesized to protect against CVD by decreasing the risk of thrombus formation. Studies have also shown that UVA decreases blood pressure and increases blood flow and heart rate in humans, which is beneficial to the cardiovascular system. Additionally, regular exposure to safe levels of sunlight or UV-containing phototherapy may have a number of benefits, potentially dependent on the predominance of the wavelengths of UV radiation administered. However, further research is required to determine if this is independent of vitamin D."
"Does a supposedly ""alkaline-rich"" diet prevent chronic diseases?","['False', 'True', 'NEI']",NEI,No,No,"The review does not provide conclusive evidence that an alkaline-rich diet prevents chronic diseases. While there may be some value in considering an alkaline diet in reducing morbidity and mortality from chronic diseases, further studies are warranted in this area of medicine. The review discusses the potential benefits of alkali therapy in neutralizing acid production associated with typical Western diets and suggests that neutralizing acid load in the diet with alkali had favorable effects on intermediate markers of musculoskeletal health. However, a causal association between dietary acid load and osteoporotic bone disease is not supported by evidence, and there is no evidence that an alkaline diet is protective of bone health. Therefore, it cannot be concluded that an alkaline-rich diet prevents chronic diseases."
Does taking LaVita promote health or physical and mental performance? (Reader inquiry),"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The context suggests that LaVita, a dihydroquercetin-rich extract derived from the Dahurian larch tree, has been studied for its potential beneficial effects on health and physical performance. The findings indicate that LaVita supplementation can promote an important cognitive enhancement in executive functions and increase muscle glycogen content storage, which enhances exercise performance and anti-fatigue effects. Additionally, LaVita has been shown to dose-dependently increase endurance swimming time and decrease levels of serum lactate, ammonia, creatine kinase, blood urea nitrogen, and glucose utilization after acute exercise challenge. These results suggest that LaVita may have a positive impact on physical and mental performance. However, further research is needed to fully understand the extent of its benefits."
Are there medical benefits to wearing a bra?,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The context suggests that wearing a bra, particularly a well-fitting sports bra, can provide medical benefits. These benefits include increased comfort and potentially improved performance during physical activity. The design features of greater breast elevation and compression in sports bras have been shown to significantly increase breast and bra comfort compared to standard encapsulation sports bras during physical activity for women with large breasts. Furthermore, appropriate sports bras are crucial to limit potential breast pain and ptosis. The context also indicates that ill-fitting bras and insufficient breast support can lead to the development of musculoskeletal pain and inhibit women from participating in physical activity. Therefore, it can be inferred that wearing a well-fitting bra, especially during exercise, can provide medical benefits."
,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"Justification: Whole cow's milk is known to have several health disadvantages for infants. It has a low iron content, which can lead to iron deficiency and anemia, and is associated with lower childhood developmental scores. Consuming whole cow's milk in infancy has been linked to weight acceleration and development of overweight in childhood. It has also been implicated in a variety of disorders including atherosclerosis, recurrent abdominal pain of childhood, cataracts, milk-borne infections, and juvenile delinquency. Furthermore, it is associated with occult gastrointestinal bleeding and cow's milk allergy. It is recommended that whole cow's milk should not be fed to infants during the first year of life."
Does training on vibration platforms cause a noticeable buildup of muscle strength?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"Current evidence suggests that vibration training is effective in enhancing strength and power capacity of humans. The vibration elicits involuntary muscle stretch reflex contractions, leading to increased motor unit recruitment and synchronization of synergist muscles. This may result in greater training adaptations over time, contributing to a noticeable buildup of muscle strength. Vibration training has been combined with conventional resistance training to attain greater gains in neuromuscular performance. Although the effect of vibration on strength and power development is dependent on various factors, such as vibration characteristics and exercise protocols, it has been suggested as an effective methodology to improve muscle strength and power performance."
Does taking DHEA have an anti-aging effect by increasing the physical and mental well-being of older people?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",No,Yes,Yes,"The context suggests that DHEA, a hormone that decreases with age, has been proposed to have a favorable role in successful aging. It has been extensively studied for its potential anti-aging effects, and its supplementation has been advertised as an anti-aging medication. DHEA supplementation has been associated with beneficial effects in the elderly, including improved cognitive function, increased bone mineral density, and muscular strength. It has also been suggested that DHEA might be able to temporarily slow down the aging process. However, it is important to note that while DHEA has been proposed to have anti-aging effects, its use should be approached with caution as possible deleterious side effects have not been fully assessed."
,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) has been shown to have both energizing and antioxidative effects, which contribute to its reported antiaging action. In the context of skin health, CoQ10 acts as an antioxidant and is frequently used in anti-aging products. Topical CoQ10 treatment has been demonstrated to be beneficial for effective CoQ10 replenishment, augmentation of cellular energy metabolism, and antioxidant effects. In recent in vivo investigations, cosmetically applied CoQ10 has shown its ability to reduce photoaging, with a corresponding decrease in wrinkle depth. These findings suggest that CoQ10 can lead to a rejuvenation of the skin's appearance."
Is barley grass good for health?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The context suggests that barley grass, scientifically known as Hordeum vulgare L., is considered beneficial for health. It is a rich source of various bioactive compounds and has been shown to exhibit potent in vitro antioxidant activity. The health benefits of barley β-glucan and other bioactive compounds have been well documented. Furthermore, research indicates that barley grass juice has antiobesity activity and can be an effective nutraceutical in managing obesity. It has also been reported to decrease body weight, improve lipid profile, and enhance liver function markers. Additionally, young barley grass has been found to have a cancer chemopreventive potential in colon carcinoma. Therefore, based on the provided context, it can be concluded that barley grass is good for health."
Does taking ginger prevent motion sickness??,"['True', 'False', 'NEI']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The efficacy of ginger for the prevention of nausea, dizziness, and vomiting associated with motion sickness has been well documented in numerous high-quality clinical studies. In a double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled study, thirteen volunteers with a history of motion sickness underwent circular vection, during which nausea, electrogastrographic recordings, and plasma vasopressin levels were assessed with or without ginger pretreatment. The results showed that ginger effectively reduces nausea, tachygastric activity, and vasopressin release induced by circular vection. Ginger has also been shown to prolong the latency before nausea onset and shorten the recovery time after vection cessation. The medicinal properties of ginger, including the alleviation of nausea, have been associated with the gingerols. Pretreatment with ginger (1,000 and 2,000 mg) reduced nausea, tachygastria, and plasma vasopressin. Therefore, it can be concluded that taking ginger can prevent motion sickness."
Do whole grains lower the likelihood of dying early?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"Justification: Epidemiological evidence supports the association of a diet high in whole grains with a lowered risk of chronic diseases, including coronary heart disease, obesity, type 2 diabetes, and certain types of cancer. Higher intake of whole grain has been associated with significantly decreased all-cause and cardiovascular disease-specific mortality, independent of other factors such as age, body mass index, smoking, alcohol intake, physical activity, history of diabetes, hypertension, or high cholesterol, and use of multivitamins. The inverse association between whole-grain intake and mortality suggests a potential benefit of whole-grain consumption in reducing the likelihood of dying early."
Does coenzyme Q10 relieve muscle discomfort during treatment with statins?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) supplementation has been shown to decrease statin-associated muscular pain in patients with mild-to-moderate muscle symptoms. In a specific group of patients, CoQ10 supplementation (50 mg twice daily) effectively reduced statin-related mild-to-moderate muscular symptoms, causing lower interference of statin-related muscular symptoms with daily activities. A six-month administration of CoQ10 in patients with confirmed statin myalgia resulted in a statistically significant decrease in muscle pain and sensitivity. CoQ10 supplementation has been found to ameliorate statin-associated muscle symptoms, such as muscle pain, weakness, cramp, and tiredness, compared to placebo. CoQ10 deficiency has been associated with statin-induced myopathy, and supplementation with CoQ10 may reduce inflammation markers. Therefore, CoQ10 supplementation may be a complementary approach to manage statin-induced myopathy."
Does brain training boost intelligence?,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",No,NEI,NEI,"The effectiveness of cognitive training, often referred to as ""brain training,"" in improving general cognition and intelligence is a controversial topic. While cognitive training has been shown to be an effective tool for improving performance on specific tasks, the degree to which it can improve performance on tasks dissimilar from the trained tasks (transfer of training) is not well established. Some studies have shown that brain stimulation accompanying cognitive training protocols can enhance their effects, but the evidence is limited. Additionally, individual differences in brain function and training performance may play a role in the effectiveness of cognitive training. Therefore, it is not possible to definitively state that brain training boosts intelligence based on the available evidence. Further research is needed to determine the conditions under which cognitive training is most effective and for whom it is most useful."
Does psychotherapy help with burnout?,"['True', 'False', 'NEI']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"The context suggests that psychotherapy, specifically cognitive behavior therapy, is helpful for the emotional exhaustion component of burnout. The study aimed to investigate the association between therapist-level burnout and patient-level treatment outcomes after psychological therapy. The findings imply that the therapy program may have beneficial effects on symptomatology and neuroplasticity of patients with burnout. Counseling and/or coaching may also be helpful for those having burnout without significant depression. The review offers evidence that burnout is a concern for those working in the delivery of psychological interventions. The increasing prevalence of stress-related disorders such as burnout urges the need for specialized treatment approaches. Over half of sampled psychotherapists reported moderate-high levels of burnout. The level of burnout symptoms among all therapists was related to temperament traits, briskness, and perseveration, as well as to perceived social support."
Can therapy with EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing) alleviate the symptoms of people with post-traumatic stress disorder?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"Justification: The context provides substantial evidence that Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) therapy is an efficacious treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). EMDR targets emotionally disturbing visual memories of traumatic life events and involves the individual making saccadic eye-movements while imagining the traumatic event. This therapy has been widely recognized as an effective psychological intervention for PTSD, with numerous studies demonstrating its efficacy. EMDR is considered highly efficacious for the treatment of PTSD and has been consistently evaluated as a valid treatment approach with a wide range of applications. Furthermore, EMDR is becoming a recognized and accepted form of psychotherapy for PTSD, and it has been shown to be a useful psychotherapy to treat trauma-associated symptoms in patients with comorbid psychiatric disorders."
Does taking proton pump inhibitors (PPI) increase the risk of bone fractures?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"The use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) has been shown to be associated with an increased risk of bone fractures, particularly hip and spine fractures. This association has been observed in both epidemiological and clinical studies, with a higher risk noted in patients who have been on long-term PPI therapy, especially for a year or more. The exact mechanism behind this increased risk is not yet fully understood, but it is suggested that PPIs may impair bone quality and quantity. It is important to note that while the results of studies have been somewhat inconsistent, the majority indicate a moderate increase in fracture risk with PPI use."
Does mesotherapy help against pain?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",No,Yes,Yes,"The context suggests that mesotherapy has shown a good effect in reducing acute and chronic musculoskeletal pain. It is a well-tolerated treatment that involves microinjections of conventional homeopathic medication and/or vitamins into the skin to promote healing. The results of mesotherapy treatment are encouraging for the resolution of acute and chronic musculoskeletal vertebral pain. The reports concerning mesotherapy are increasing in number in the literature, indicating its potential as a treatment option for pain. However, it is important to note that there are reported systemic and local side effects of mesotherapy, and there are no definitive treatment protocols for this approach. Therefore, further research is needed to establish standard protocols for mesotherapy in rehabilitation."
Can ginkgo extract relieve the symptoms of tinnitus?,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",No,NEI,NEI,"The context suggests that Ginkgo Biloba extract has been used in the treatment of tinnitus, particularly in elderly patients, and is a frequently prescribed treatment for this condition. However, the evidence regarding its effectiveness is mixed. While some studies have found that Ginkgo Biloba extract can alleviate tinnitus and dizziness, others have not found reliable evidence to support its use for tinnitus associated with cerebral insufficiency. Therefore, it is not possible to definitively conclude whether Ginkgo extract can relieve the symptoms of tinnitus based on the available information."
,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"Justification: The context provides evidence that collagenase injections are a minimally invasive treatment option for Dupuytren's contracture, a condition that causes bent fingers. The enzyme collagenase has been shown to be effective in reducing joint contractures and improving the range of motion in affected joints. The treatment involves percutaneous injection of collagenase, which cleaves collagen fibers, leading to weakening and eventual rupture of the fibrous cords responsible for the contracture. The context also mentions a case of a 61-year-old male who achieved significant improvement after collagenase injection. Therefore, it can be concluded that injections with the enzyme collagenase can straighten fingers bent by Dupuytren's disease without surgery."
Does whole-body cryotherapy in the cold chamber improve health?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"Whole-body cryotherapy (WBC) has been reported to have a positive effect on health, particularly in the treatment of motor organ issues, nervous system diseases, psychiatry, dermatology, and laryngology. The therapy involves short whole-body exposure to extremely cold air (-110°C to -140°C) in a special room called a cryogenic chamber. The primary effect of WBC is the cooling of the tissues, which has been shown to reduce pain effectively in the post-operative period after reconstructive surgery of the joints. WBC is also used to improve recovery from musculoskeletal trauma in sports medicine. Furthermore, WBC has been shown to relieve pain symptoms, particularly in inflammatory diseases, injuries, and overuse symptoms. Therefore, it can be concluded that WBC in the cold chamber improves health."
Does stool transplantation help with ulcerative colitis?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has been shown to have a potential therapeutic value for the treatment of ulcerative colitis. This is due to its ability to change the abundance of bacterial flora and improve scores for diarrhea, abdominal pain, and mucous membrane lesions in patients with this disease. FMT may contribute to disease remission in ulcerative colitis, although the factors that determine the effects of treatment remain unknown. FMT and mixed probiotics VSL#3 have achieved good results in clinical remission and clinical response in active ulcerative colitis, with no increased risk of adverse reactions. The taxonomic composition of the donor's intestinal microbiota is a major factor influencing the efficacy of FMT in ulcerative colitis patients. Improvements in the intestinal microflora may relieve the disease. Clinical indices, such as the Mayo score, have been used to assess the efficacy of FMT in patients with ulcerative colitis."
Do Lifewave patches improve health or athletic and mental performance?,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",NEI,NEI,NEI,"The context provided does not contain specific information regarding the effects of Lifewave patches on health, athletic, or mental performance. While the context mentions that Lifewave patches produce changes consistent with increased energy production, it also states that little is known about their effects on cortisol concentrations or peripheral circulation. The context also discusses the benefits of regular physical activity, music listening during exercise, and wearable devices for health and wellbeing, but these do not directly address the question about Lifewave patches. Therefore, there is not enough information to determine whether Lifewave patches improve health or athletic and mental performance."
,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",NEI,NEI,NEI,"Justification: The provided context does not contain information on monk's pepper (Vitex agnus-castus), a plant that has been traditionally used to treat cycle disorders. Therefore, it is not possible to determine if monk's pepper can help with cycle disorders based on the given context. Further research is needed to establish the efficacy of monk's pepper in managing cycle disorders."
Do protein supplements help build muscle?,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"Protein supplements have been shown to enhance muscle protein synthesis after exercise, leading to increased muscle mass and strength gains during prolonged resistance-type exercise training in both younger and older subjects. The provision of dietary amino acids, which are found in protein supplements, increases skeletal muscle protein synthesis, an effect that is further enhanced by prior resistance exercise. Protein supplementation following exercise has been shown to stimulate protein synthesis acutely in skeletal muscle and has been recommended to prevent sarcopenia. It is generally accepted that protein supplementation is required to maximize the adaptive response of the skeletal muscle to prolonged resistance-type exercise training."
Can increased water consumption prevent migraines or other headaches?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The present study aimed to evaluate the relation between water intake and headache properties in migraine. The results showed that the severity of migraine disability, pain severity, headaches frequency, and duration of headaches were significantly lower in those who consumed more water or total water. The data of the present study suggest a reduction in the total number of hours and intensity of headache episodes after increased water intake. A randomized trial on the effects of regular water intake in patients with recurrent headaches found that water intake is a cost-effective, non-invasive, and low-risk intervention to reduce or prevent headache pain. Drinking more water resulted in a statistically significant improvement of 4.5 points on migraine-specific quality of life. The present study found a significant negative correlation between daily water intake and migraine headache characteristics. The advice to increase the daily fluid intake by 1.5 l increased the fluid intake in the intervention group by approximately 1 l, which reduced the total hours of headache in 2 weeks by 21 hours."
Does the juice of the aronia berry help against cystitis?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The context suggests that the juice of the aronia berry has an inhibitory effect on dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP IV) activity, and the DPP IV inhibitor in aronia juice was identified as cyanidin 3,5-diglucoside. While the context does not explicitly state that aronia berry juice helps against cystitis, it does suggest that it has potential health benefits, including the inhibition of bacterial adherence to urinary epithelial cells, which is a common cause of urinary tract infections (UTIs) such as cystitis. Additionally, the context mentions that cranberry juice, which is also rich in proanthocyanidins, has been used for the prevention and treatment of UTIs, further supporting the potential benefits of aronia berry juice for cystitis."
,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"The introduction of cow's milk to the diet of infants and young children has been associated with an increased risk of iron deficiency and anemia. The low iron content in cow's milk, coupled with its propensity to displace iron-rich foods from the diet, can lead to inadequate iron intake and subsequent deficiency. Furthermore, the early introduction of cow's milk, before 24 weeks of age, has been linked to iron deficiency and anemia. The use of fresh cow's milk in early infancy has also been found to contribute to the development of measurable degrees of iron deficiency. In many instances, excessive amounts of milk have been shown to produce severe iron deficiency anemia during the second year of life in infants of greater than average birth weight. The feeding of cow's milk to infants is considered undesirable due to its tendency to lead to iron deficiency and its potential to increase the risk of severe dehydration. Therefore, it is recommended that iron-fortified formulas be used during the first year of life if human milk is not available."
Does ivermectin lower the risk of death in covid-19?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"Justification: The context suggests that ivermectin treatment was associated with lower mortality during treatment of COVID-19, particularly in patients with severe pulmonary involvement. The mortality rate was significantly lower in the ivermectin group compared to the group not receiving ivermectin (13.3% vs 24.5%). Additionally, mortality was also lower among ivermectin-treated patients with severe pulmonary involvement (38.8% vs 80.7%). These findings suggest that ivermectin may have a beneficial effect in reducing the risk of death in COVID-19 patients. However, further studies are needed to confirm these findings and determine the optimal dosing and administration of ivermectin for COVID-19 treatment."
Can taking vitamin D relieve chronic pain?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The context suggests that vitamin D has a role in reducing inflammation, pain, and myopathy. As vitamin D levels increase, pain intensity decreases. This is likely due to the anti-inflammatory properties of vitamin D. Furthermore, the context indicates that vitamin D plus calcium is superior to no therapy or calcium alone in managing corticosteroid-induced osteoporosis, a condition that can cause chronic pain. Therefore, it can be inferred that taking vitamin D may help relieve chronic pain. However, the effectiveness of vitamin D in relieving chronic pain may vary depending on the individual and the cause of the pain."
Does drinking breast milk as a baby have a positive effect on later health and development?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"Numerous studies have indicated that breast milk consumption during infancy has a positive impact on later health and development. Breast milk is a biologically optimal source of nutrition for newborns and infants, as it contains a nutrient composition that matches their nutritional needs. This nutritional support has been linked to improved neurodevelopment in children, with breastfeeding associated with higher cognitive scores. The positive influence of breast milk on brain development is thought to be mediated by its effects on white matter growth.

     Furthermore, breastfeeding has been associated with a variety of long-term health benefits, including prolonging the birth interval to the subsequent sibling and increasing earning ability. Studies have reported a positive association between the duration of breastfeeding and IQ in childhood, as well as better performance in intelligence tests for subjects who had been breastfed.

     However, it is important to note that observational findings linking breast milk to higher cognitive scores may be confounded by factors associated with mothers' choice to breastfeed. Nonetheless, the overall evidence supports the health-promoting effects of breastfeeding and its positive influence on later health and development."
Do essential oils protect against corona infections and other viral infections like colds or flu?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The review article suggests that essential oils have shown promise as antiviral agents against several pathogenic viruses, including influenza and coronaviruses. In vitro and in vivo experiments have demonstrated that essential oils and oleoresins can induce antiviral effects against coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus. Essential oils have also been reported to possess antiviral activity against a wide spectrum of viruses, including influenza type A virus. The antiviral effects of essential oils have been found to cause capsid disintegration and viral expansion, which prevents the virus from infecting host cells. Essential oils have also been shown to inhibit hemagglutinin, an important membrane protein of various viruses, which allows the virus to enter the host cell. Furthermore, essential oils have been reported to be effective against severe acute respiratory syndrome associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) using a cell-based assay. Influenza virus infectivity was suppressed by essential oil treatment in a dose-dependent manner, and many essential oils and their components could inhibit the late stages of the viral life cycle by targeting the redox signaling pathway. Therefore, based on the evidence presented in the review article, it can be concluded that essential oils have the potential to protect against corona infections and other viral infections like colds or flu."
Does bloodletting according to Hildegard von Bingen have health benefits?,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",NEI,NEI,NEI,"The context does not provide specific information regarding the health benefits of bloodletting according to Hildegard von Bingen. However, it does discuss the potential benefits of bloodletting, or phlebotomy, in reducing cardiovascular risk through reductions in whole blood viscosity, excessive iron, oxidative stress, and inflammation. It also mentions that bloodletting has been used extensively throughout history and across cultures for various medical purposes. The context also notes that the effects of phlebotomy on vascular function in human subjects have not been well characterized. Therefore, it is not possible to definitively state whether bloodletting according to Hildegard von Bingen has health benefits based on the provided context."

However, it does discuss the use of ultrasound in various applications, including object detection, pest repellent systems, and cleaning of medical devices. The text also mentions that ultrasound has potential to be used for disinfection and its antimicrobial effectiveness can be enhanced in presence of natural compounds. Despite this, the context does not provide sufficient information to definitively state whether ultrasound devices are effective against dust mites. Further research would be required to determine the effectiveness of ultrasound devices against dust mites."
"Can choline ingested with food - alone or in the form of lecithin, for example - improve memory?","['NEI', 'True', 'False']",NEI,NEI,NEI,"The context suggests that choline, a dietary component and precursor of acetylcholine, has been implicated in memory-related brain functions. Animal studies have shown that choline supplementation can increase choline and acetylcholine concentrations in the brain and adrenal gland, and enhance working memory and hippocampal long-term potentiation in adult offspring. However, the context also indicates that the effects of choline on memory in human subjects have not been well studied, and that choline likely has no acute effects on cholinergic memory functions in healthy human participants. Therefore, it is not possible to definitively conclude whether choline ingested with food can improve memory based on the information provided."
Can weighted blankets help with sleep disorders?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The context suggests that weighted blankets have shown potential in improving sleep-related symptoms, particularly in patients with specific disorders such as major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. The use of weighted blankets has been associated with better sleep-maintenance, higher daytime activity levels, and reduced daytime symptoms of fatigue, depression, and anxiety. The intervention by the weighted blanket resulted in a significantly better sleep-maintenance and a higher daytime activity level. Additionally, weighted blankets have been found to be an effective and safe intervention for insomnia in patients with the aforementioned disorders. The outcomes of these studies suggest that weighted blankets have the potential to be beneficial in limited settings and populations. However, it is also noted that evidence-based research on the effectiveness of weighted blankets in reducing anxiety and insomnia is sparse, and more research is needed to define guidelines for the use of weighted blankets in clinical practice and to investigate the underlying mechanism of action."
Are ultrasound examinations during pregnancy safe for the health of the child?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"The systematic review of scientific literature on possible harmful effects on child development of ultrasound investigation during pregnancy concludes that there is no adverse effect of ultrasound examinations during pregnancy on child development outcomes. Ultrasound is a common procedure performed in pregnancy and is an essential imaging tool for evaluating physiological and pathological fetal or maternal conditions during pregnancy. Although it is generally assumed that prenatal ultrasound is safe, very few studies have focused on possible adverse effects in humans. However, the review of epidemiological studies of human exposure to diagnostic ultrasound during pregnancy did not find any evidence of harm. The use of ultrasound in obstetrics is an integral part of prenatal care and is currently the modality of choice for examination of the fetus in pregnancy. While the potential risk and benefit of obstetric ultrasound must be better understood, the available evidence suggests that ultrasound examinations during pregnancy are safe for the health of the child."
"Does taking chlorella provide better performance, more resilience and does it promote health?","['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The context suggests that daily dietary supplementation with chlorella may provide various health benefits. Chlorella, a green microalga, has been shown to enhance immune system function, reduce high blood pressure, lower serum cholesterol levels, accelerate wound healing, and improve glycemic control in rats with type 2 diabetes. Furthermore, a combination of chlorella intake and aerobic exercise training has been found to significantly improve these effects compared to either intervention alone. Chlorella contains various antioxidants, amino acids, and fiber, and has been reported to have favorable immune function-related effects on biological secretions such as blood and breast milk. The potential of chlorella to relieve symptoms, improve quality of life, and normalize body functions in patients with chronic illnesses such as fibromyalgia, hypertension, and ulcerative colitis suggests that larger, more comprehensive clinical trials are warranted. These findings suggest that taking chlorella may provide better performance, more resilience, and promote overall health."
Does treatment with radioactive agents help with pain in chronic inflammatory joint disease?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"The use of radioactive agents, specifically beta-emitting radionuclides, has been shown to be effective in the treatment of chronic inflammatory joint diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. This treatment approach, known as radiation synovectomy or radiosynoviorthesis, involves the intra-articular injection of these agents to destroy the affected synovial tissue. The use of radiopharmaceuticals in this context has been found to result in the improvement of arthritis and is well tolerated by patients. The pain-relieving effects of low-dose radon therapies have also been described for centuries. In a prospective study, radiosynoviorthesis using erbium-169 citrate was found to have good efficacy and safety in a series of patients with arthritis of the acromioclavicular joint. The use of radiopharmaceuticals in the detection of arthritis activity also has the advantage of allowing direct imaging of joints, including those that are difficult to assess clinically or radiographically."
Does the Alexander Technique help with back pain and neck pain?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"The Alexander Technique has been shown to be clinically beneficial for both chronic back pain and neck pain. It aims to improve postural coordination by altering automatic postural coordination and ongoing muscular activity, and has been reported to reduce low back pain. In a randomized controlled trial, lessons in the Alexander Technique and exercise prescription proved effective for managing low back pain in primary care. In another study, acupuncture sessions and Alexander Technique lessons both led to significant reductions in neck pain and associated disability compared with usual care at 12 months. The technique also provides neuromuscular re-education and may influence anticipation of pain. It has been reported to aid relaxation and improve postural and movement coordination. The technique seeks to eliminate harmful patterns of tension that interfere with the control of posture and movement, and in doing so, it may serve as a viable intervention method for increasing gait efficacy in older adults."
Do remedies with hops or valerian help with anxiety disorders?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The context suggests that hops, either alone or in combination with valerian, have been used in traditional European medicine as a mild sedative for the treatment of anxiety, nervousness, and insomnia. Hops (Humulus lupulus) is used as a herbal medicinal product for anxiety/mood disorders. In otherwise healthy young adults reporting at least mild depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms, daily supplementation with a hops dry extract can significantly improve all these symptoms over a 4-week period. The beneficial effects of hops for anxiety/mood disorders and restlessness have been approved by the German Commission E."
Do green smoothies promote health?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"Justification: The context suggests that green smoothies, which are a convenient way to consume fruits and vegetables, are rich in health-promoting compounds. The studies mentioned have consistently found positive associations between greenness and health. Exposure to green environments, including consuming green smoothies, has been linked to health benefits such as increased vitality, energy, and overall mental health. Furthermore, greenness may influence health by promoting physical activity, social contact, and improved mental health, as well as reducing stress and exposure to air pollution, noise, and heat. The findings, while not conclusive, suggest that green smoothies have the potential to promote health and well-being."
Does taking vitamin K lower the risk of spinal fractures in older women?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",No,Yes,Yes,"The evidence from various studies suggests that vitamin K, particularly vitamin K2, may play a role in reducing the incidence of vertebral fractures in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. Although the exact mechanisms are not fully understood, vitamin K has been shown to help maintain bone mineral density and improve bone quality. While the evidence from randomized controlled trials is not strongly supportive, observational studies have shown a link between vitamin K intake and lower risk of fractures in this population. Additionally, recent studies have reported that vitamin K reduces vertebral fractures without increasing bone mass in patients with osteoporosis. Therefore, it can be concluded that taking vitamin K may lower the risk of spinal fractures in older women."
Can taking spermidine prolong life? Can it prevent diseases?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The context suggests that spermidine supplementation can extend lifespan and healthspan across various species, including yeast, nematodes, flies, and mice. In humans, high levels of dietary spermidine have been correlated with reduced blood pressure and a lower incidence of cardiovascular disease. Recent studies have shown that spermidine supplementation can prolong lifespan and exert cardioprotective effects in both mice and humans. Furthermore, spermidine has been implicated in delaying age-related cognitive decline and possibly preventing Alzheimer's disease. The compound has also been found to suppress inflammation and oxidation, which are associated with various diseases. Therefore, it can be inferred that taking spermidine may prolong life and prevent diseases."
Are endocrine disruptors in cosmetics a health risk?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"Justification: The context provides evidence that endocrine disruptors, such as phthalates, parabens, bisphenol A (BPA), and triclosan, are present in cosmetics and personal care products. These chemicals have been shown to interfere with hormone action in the body, leading to endocrine disruption and negatively affecting human health and development. Laboratory and human studies have raised concerns about endocrine disruption and other health issues, such as asthma, resulting from exposure to these chemicals. The endocrine disruptor hypothesis asserts that exogenous substances with estrogenic or other hormonally active properties may adversely affect human health. Furthermore, endocrine disruptors have been linked to a range of health issues, including male and female reproduction, breast development and cancer, prostate cancer, neuroendocrinology, thyroid, metabolism and obesity, and cardiovascular endocrinology. Therefore, it can be concluded that endocrine disruptors in cosmetics pose a health risk."
Do pregnant women who take vitamin D in combination with calcium have a lower risk of preterm birth?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",No,Yes,Yes,"The available evidence suggests that pregnant women who take vitamin D in combination with calcium may have a lower risk of preterm birth. Studies have shown that low calcium and vitamin D intake can impact offspring phenotype and preterm birth rate. Additionally, vitamin D supplementation, with or without calcium, has been associated with a lower risk of preeclampsia, which is a known risk factor for preterm birth. Furthermore, three trials found that supplementation with vitamin D plus calcium reduced the risk of pre-eclampsia. However, more studies are needed to confirm these findings and to determine the optimal dosage and timing of supplementation."
Do amalgam fillings affect the mental development of school children compared to plastic dental fillings?,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",No,No,No,"The New England Children's Amalgam Trial found that children randomized to amalgam had better psychosocial outcomes than those assigned to composites for posterior tooth restorations. Over a 5-year period, there were no statistically significant differences in adverse neuropsychological or renal effects observed in children whose caries were restored using dental amalgam or composite materials. Exposure to elemental mercury in amalgam at the levels experienced by the children in the trial did not result in significant effects on neuropsychological function within the 5-year follow-up period. No evidence was found that exposure to mercury from dental amalgams was associated with adverse psychosocial outcomes over the five-year period following initial placement of amalgams."
"Does birch water, also called birch sap, help with health problems?","['NEI', 'True', 'False']",NEI,NEI,NEI,"The provided context discusses the potential health benefits of birch buds and birch extracts, but it does not provide any information on birch water, also known as birch sap. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether birch water has any health benefits based on the given context. Further research is needed to determine the potential health benefits of birch water."
Does meditation help against stress?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"Justification: The context provides substantial evidence that meditation is an effective strategy for managing stress. It has been found to significantly reduce stress levels in both healthy individuals and patients with psychosomatic disorders. Meditation has been shown to decrease physiological markers of stress and improve mental health. Furthermore, it has been associated with lower stress, higher positive affect, and reduced stress-induced immune and behavioral responses. Therefore, it can be concluded that meditation does help against stress."
Can regular exercise prevent or relieve migraine symptoms?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"Justification: The consensus in the literature is that regular exercise can have a positive effect on migraine symptoms, including reducing the frequency, intensity, and/or duration of migraine attacks. Some migraine patients find that regular exercise helps in reducing the frequency of headache attacks. Aerobic exercise has been shown to decrease migraine burden in persons. Exercise activates endogenous neurotransmitter signals that could be effective in reducing the intensity of migraine pain, though it may not have a direct effect on its overall frequency or duration. However, it is important to note that strenuous physical activity is also reported as a migraine trigger."
Are statins useful in preventing cardiovascular disease in people 75 years and older???,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The available evidence suggests that statins are useful in preventing cardiovascular disease in people 75 years and older. Statins have been shown to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events in patients aged 65-80 years with clinical cardiovascular disease or diabetes. While there is a lack of research on the effects of statin regimens in older patients aged 75 years and over, available evidence shows that statins reduce cardiovascular events and invasive revascularization in older adults. Moderate-dose statins have been shown to be effective and safe in properly selected elderly patients up to the age of 80 years. However, the role of statins in the elderly remains a subject of debate, and their clinical benefit for primary and secondary prevention among older adults with frailty is uncertain."
"Is brown millet effective in favorably influencing the course of the disease in rheumatism (""rheumatoid arthritis"")?","['NEI', 'True', 'False']",NEI,NEI,NEI,"Justification: The provided context does not contain any information regarding the use of brown millet in the treatment or management of rheumatoid arthritis. Therefore, it is not possible to determine its effectiveness based on the given information. Further research and evidence are needed to make a definitive conclusion."
Does coffee reduce the risk of dementia?,"['True', 'False', 'NEI']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"Numerous epidemiological studies have demonstrated that coffee consumption is associated with a lower risk of developing dementia, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). The findings suggest that higher lifetime coffee intake may contribute to lowering the risk of AD or related cognitive decline by reducing pathological cerebral amyloid deposition. Coffee and its components have several neuroprotective properties that lower the risk of cognitive decline and other neurodegenerative diseases. Recent results from prospective cohort studies have shown that moderate coffee consumption is associated with a reduced risk for diabetes mellitus type II or Alzheimer's disease. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that chronic treatment with coffee polyphenols prevented cognitive dysfunction and significantly reduced the amount of amyloid β (Aβ) plaques in the hippocampus. However, the mechanism by which coffee may provide neuroprotection in humans is not fully understood."
Does wearing bras promote breast cancer risk?,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",NEI,No,No,"The study aimed to evaluate the relationship between various bra-wearing habits and breast cancer risk among postmenopausal women. The results did not support an association between bra wearing and increased breast cancer risk among postmenopausal women. The study investigated the associations of lifestyle, menstrual/reproductive, and histological factors with risk of breast cancer among women biopsied for benign breast disease (BBD). The study suggests that use of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and having atypical hyperplasia are associated with increased risk of breast cancer among women with BBD, while postmenopausal women with BBD have a reduced risk. However, whether conventional breast cancer risk factors influence risk of breast cancer among women with BBD is unclear. The study did not find evidence to support the claim that wearing bras promotes breast cancer risk."
Does regular consumption of energy drinks harm heart health?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"Justification: The context suggests that regular consumption of energy drinks could potentially harm heart health. Studies have reported cardiovascular events associated with energy drink consumption, including increased platelet aggregation and decreased endothelial function in healthy young adults. Energy drink consumption has also been linked to an increase in mean arterial pressure. Furthermore, the consumption of these beverages has been associated with a variety of health risk behaviors, including caffeine toxicity and alcohol use. However, it is important to note that clinical trials to support these links are lacking, and more research is needed to fully understand the health effects of energy drinks on the cardiovascular system."
Does Imunoglukan strengthen the immune system?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The context provides evidence that Imunoglukan, also referred to as immulina®, has been shown to enhance the activity of natural killer (NK) cells, a crucial component of the immune system. Two independent studies demonstrated an increase in NK cell activity following administration of immulina® for seven days. In one study, a 40% average increase in the killing of K562 tumor cells by NK cells was observed after immulina® supplementation. Furthermore, the mRNA expression of NK cell markers, such as NKG2D and perforin, was significantly increased after administration of immulina®. These findings suggest that Imunoglukan may strengthen the immune system by enhancing NK cell activity."
Is Exemestane better than other hormone-altering drugs for reducing the risk of breast cancer or treating it?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"Exemestane, a third-generation aromatase inhibitor, has been shown to be effective in reducing the risk of breast cancer in high-risk postmenopausal women. A study of 4560 women found a 65% relative reduction in the annual occurrence of invasive breast cancer compared with placebo. Additionally, a 53% reduction in invasive plus noninvasive breast cancer was observed. Exemestane has also been shown to have a relative reduction in risk of breast cancer recurrence or death of 24% compared with tamoxifen when given after 2 to 3 years of tamoxifen. Exemestane has been identified as a potential chemopreventive option with fewer serious side effects compared with selective estrogen receptor modulators in postmenopausal women. It is a safe and well-tolerated alternative for the treatment of postmenopausal patients with advanced breast cancer."
Does Kinesio tape help in the treatment of joint and muscle injuries?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"Kinesio tape has been used to support injured muscles and joints, and relieve pain. It is an elastic therapeutic tape that is widely used for treating sports-related injuries and other disorders. Kinesiology tape has been advocated as a means of improving muscle flexibility, which is a potential modifiable risk factor for injury. It has been utilized to improve balance, proprioception, and posture. Kinesio tape is a commonly used intervention in sports and rehabilitation. However, the effect of kinesio tape on delayed-onset muscle soreness is not entirely clear."
"Is Traumeel gel or ointment effective for sports injuries such as sprains, bruises and strains?","['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The study indicates that Traumeel gel and ointment were found to be effective in managing acute ankle sprains, reducing pain, and improving joint function to the same extent as Diclofenac gel. The participants, who were physically active adults with unilateral grade 1 or 2 ankle sprains, were treated with Traumeel ointment, Traumeel gel, or Diclofenac gel three times a day for 14 days. The results showed that Traumeel was well-tolerated and non-inferior to Diclofenac in reducing pain and improving functional outcomes. Additionally, the study suggests that Escin-containing gels, such as Traumeel, are effective and safe for the topical treatment of blunt impact injuries, including sports injuries like sprains, bruises, and strains."
Does the drug fingolimod reduce the progression of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis similarly or better than previous drugs?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"Fingolimod has been shown to be effective in reducing the progression of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) in several clinical trials. In comparison to interferon β-1a intramuscular, fingolimod demonstrated superior efficacy in reducing the number of relapses and slowing down disease progression in RRMS patients. Additionally, fingolimod has been found to be effective in reducing disease activity in RRMS patients who required an escalation from first-line therapies. The drug has also been approved for the treatment of highly active RRMS in Europe and is the first oral drug indicated in monotherapy as a modifier of the course of very active RRMS. Furthermore, in phase 3 clinical trials, fingolimod showed significant reductions in both focal lesions and rate of brain volume loss in RRMS patients. Therefore, it can be concluded that fingolimod reduces the progression of RRMS similarly or better than previous drugs."
Does treatment according to the fascial distortion model help with chronic shoulder pain?,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",Yes,NEI,NEI,"The provided context does not mention the fascial distortion model as a treatment for chronic shoulder pain. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether treatment according to this model is effective in reducing chronic shoulder pain. The context does, however, provide evidence that various interventions, such as multimodal treatment of myofascial trigger points, manipulative therapy, and minimally invasive treatments, can be effective in reducing pain, increasing range of motion, and improving function in patients with chronic shoulder pain."
Are there methods that effectively help against hormonal hair loss?,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"There are several methods that have been shown to be effective in managing hormonal hair loss, also known as androgenetic alopecia. These methods primarily involve pharmaceutical interventions and lifestyle changes. Pharmaceutical treatments often include medications such as minoxidil and finasteride, which have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of androgenetic alopecia. Minoxidil is a topical treatment that promotes hair growth, while finasteride is an oral medication that inhibits the production of dihydrotestosterone (DHT), a hormone that contributes to hair loss. Other treatments, such as low-level laser therapy (LLLT), have also been shown to be effective in promoting hair growth. Lifestyle changes, such as maintaining a healthy diet and reducing stress, can also help manage hormonal hair loss. However, it is important to note that the effectiveness of these methods can vary from person to person, and it is recommended to consult with a healthcare provider to determine the best course of treatment."
"Are kinesiotapes effective for chronic non-specific lower back pain (""low back pain"")?","['True', 'NEI', 'False']",No,Yes,Yes,", but the effects may be too small to be clinically worthwhile.

     Kinesio taping has been found to reduce disability and pain in people with chronic non-specific low back pain, as per the results of randomized controlled trials. However, the effects may be too small to be clinically significant. The use of kinesiotaping as a simple and noninvasive treatment for chronic nonspecific low back pain has been increasing, but its true merit remains unclear. Further research is needed to determine the specific types of manipulation and nonmanipulative types of chiropractic adjustive care that are most effective for particular types of low back pain."
"Do dietary supplements containing silicon (e.g. as ""organic silicon"" or silica) have health benefits?","['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"Previous studies have reported that silicon, in nutritional amounts, has a positive effect on bone health, immune response, and cognitive health. Dietary silicon intake has been positively associated with bone health, including bone mineral density. Organic silicon has been linked to positive effects on skin rejuvenation, mainly through the oral route. Silicon has also been suggested to play a functional role in immune function by affecting lymphocyte proliferation. The nutritional significance of silicon for the human body is highlighted by a growing body of evidence. Bioavailable silicon may be an essential nutrient for higher animals, including humans. Dietary silicon supplementation might have a protective effect both for limiting aluminium absorption across the gut and for the removal of systemic aluminium via the urine, hence, preventing potential accumulation of aluminium in the brain. These findings suggest that dietary silicon could be of therapeutic value for preventing chronic aluminum accumulation in the brain. However, it is important to note that the mechanism of action is still unclear and further investigation is needed."
Can a straight bar improve harmless tension and pain in the neck and back?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The use of a straight bar, such as the hand grip t-bar (ht-bar), has been suggested to be beneficial in relieving chronic non-specific low back pain (nlbp) through deep cross-friction massage (roptrotherapy). Theoretically, the shape of the bar can enhance gripping comfort and increase muscular endurance, potentially reducing the common tendency for hyperextension of the neck and the use of the lower back as a major joint in sitting and standing. Additionally, the use of a double-bar placement has been shown to decrease postoperative pain and reduce stress on the thoraces compared to a single-bar placement. However, further research is needed to fully understand the effects of using a straight bar on harmless tension and pain in the neck and back."
,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"The HIV saliva self-test, which is about to be approved in the U.S., has been shown to have a high rate of accuracy and reliability in various studies. The test has demonstrated a comparable rate of accuracy to blood-based tests, with a correct interpretation rate of 83.8% for the oral-fluid test versus 84.4% for the blood test. The practicability and accuracy of the saliva self-test have been evaluated and compared to the capillary blood self-test, with both tests showing high rates of successful performance. The anti-HIV test strip methodology for saliva specimens is rapid, reliable, and easy to perform and interpret. The use of saliva as a diagnostic medium for the detection of HIV antibodies has been evaluated and found to be of sufficient sensitivity and specificity to make this protocol useful in epidemiological studies. Therefore, it can be concluded that the HIV saliva self-test is as reliable as a laboratory test or a rapid test at the doctor's office."
Does the observance of feng shui design rules help against bad sleep?,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",NEI,NEI,NEI,"The provided context does not contain information regarding the observance of feng shui design rules and its potential impact on sleep quality. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer based solely on the given information. Further research is required to establish a connection between feng shui design rules and sleep quality."
"Does processed red meat (sausages, ham, bacon) increase the risk of cardiovascular disease???","['True', 'NEI', 'False']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"Numerous studies have demonstrated a possible association between processed red meat consumption and cardiovascular disease (CVD). The high sodium content of processed red meat could increase blood pressure and explain the association with CVD. In meta-analyses of prospective cohorts, higher risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) is seen with processed meat consumption, but a smaller increase or no risk is seen with unprocessed meat consumption. Women who consumed ≥5 servings of processed red meat/wk had a 17% higher rate of hypertension than that of women who consumed <1 serving/wk. The overall findings suggest that processed meat consumption is not beneficial for cardiometabolic health, and that clinical and public health guidance should especially prioritize reducing processed meat consumption."
Does carbonic acid cause cancer?,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",No,No,No,"The context provided discusses the role of carbon dioxide (CO2) in relation to cancer, particularly its involvement in intestinal carcinogenesis. It mentions that carbonic anhydrase (CA), an enzyme that catalyzes the reversible conversion of CO2 to bicarbonate, is involved in this process. However, the question asks about carbonic acid, not carbon dioxide or carbonic anhydrase. Carbonic acid is a weak acid formed when CO2 is dissolved in water, and while it is a part of the same metabolic pathway, the context does not provide direct evidence linking carbonic acid to cancer. Therefore, based on the provided context, it cannot be concluded that carbonic acid causes cancer."
Does breastfeeding reduce the risk of sudden infant death syndrome?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"Justification: The context indicates that breastfeeding is thought to be protective against sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Epidemiological studies have shown that breast-fed infants are at a decreased risk of SIDS compared to formula-fed infants. Both partial and exclusive breastfeeding have been associated with a reduced risk of SIDS. Exclusive breastfeeding at 1 month of age halved the risk, while partial breastfeeding also reduced the risk, although the latter was not significant after adjustment. The protective effect of breastfeeding against SIDS is stronger when breastfeeding is exclusive. However, the duration of breastfeeding required to confer a protective effect is unknown."
Does oil pulling promote dental health?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The context suggests that oil pulling, particularly with coconut oil, may have a beneficial effect on improving oral health and dental hygiene. Oil pulling has been used extensively as a traditional Indian folk remedy for many years to prevent dental diseases, strengthen teeth and gums, and prevent decay, oral malodor, bleeding gums, dryness of the throat, and cracked lips. The limited evidence suggests that oil pulling with coconut oil is effective in controlling plaque levels and could be used as an adjunct to normal preventative regimes to improve oral health and dental hygiene. Oil pulling therapy using sesame oil and sunflower oil was found to reduce plaque-related gingivitis. The myth that the effect of oil-pulling therapy on oral health was just a placebo effect has been broken, and there are clear indications of possible saponification and emulsification process, which enhances its mechanical cleaning action. However, further studies are needed to determine the level of effectiveness."
"Do boron preparations such as borax, boric acid, or calcium fructoborate relieve pain associated with age-related joint wear (osteoarthritis)?","['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The evidence suggests that boron, in various forms such as borax, boric acid, or calcium fructoborate, may alleviate arthritic symptoms, including pain associated with age-related joint wear (osteoarthritis). This is supported by analytical evidence of lower boron concentrations in people with arthritis, observation evidence of harder bones in patients using boron supplements, and epidemiological evidence of lower arthritis incidence in areas with higher boron intake. Furthermore, experimental evidence from both animal and human trials indicates that boron supplementation can benefit individuals with osteoarthritis. However, it is important to note that the effects of boron may be influenced by the hormonal status of individuals and that an intake of less than 1.0mg/day may inhibit the health benefits of boron."
Is the dietary supplement nattokinase effective and safe as a blood thinner?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,", with caution

     Nattokinase, a potent fibrinolytic protease derived from a traditional Japanese food called natto, has been shown to decrease plasma levels of fibrinogen, factor VII, and factor VIII, which are associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular disease. This suggests that nattokinase may have potential as a dietary supplement for the prevention and treatment of thrombosis-related cardiovascular diseases. However, it is important to note that the use of nattokinase as a substitute for warfarin after valve replacement is strongly discouraged, as it has been documented to lead to thrombus formation on the mechanical valve. Therefore, while nattokinase may be effective as a blood thinner, it should be used with caution and under the guidance of a healthcare professional."
Can chlorinated water from baby swimming cause asthma or allergies later in childhood?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The data suggests that infant swimming practice in chlorinated indoor swimming pools is associated with airways changes that may predispose children to the development of asthma and recurrent bronchitis. Exposure to chlorinated water in swimming facilities may aggravate preexisting asthma or cause new onset asthma. The inevitable exposure to chlorine and its disinfectant byproducts in indoor swimming pools could be responsible for bronchial inflammation and asthma development. Attendance at chlorinated swimming pools in early life is associated with higher risks of new-onset airways inflammation and IgE sensitization to house dust mite, independently of other risk factors. Infant swimmers who developed bronchiolitis also showed higher risks of asthma and respiratory allergies later in childhood."
Do oral zinc supplements prevent a cold???,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"Oral zinc supplementation has been studied as a potential means of preventing or alleviating the common cold, with mixed results. However, there is evidence to suggest that oral zinc, when initiated within 24 hours of symptom onset, is associated with a shorter duration of the common cold in healthy people. Additionally, clinical studies have shown that ionic zinc (Zn2+) dissolved in the mouth can significantly shorten the manifestations of the common cold, although the mechanism is not yet fully understood. Furthermore, preventive zinc supplementation in the form of tablets or syrup has been shown to reduce the incidence of diarrhea and acute lower respiratory tract infections in young children in high-risk populations. Therefore, it can be concluded that oral zinc supplements may help prevent the common cold."
"Laboratory experiments indicate that leoligin and other substances from edelweiss have a medicinal effect. However, this has not been researched in humans.","['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The context indicates that edelweiss cell cultures have been identified as a potential source of anti-inflammatory substances for chronic inflammatory skin diseases and bacterial and atherogenic inflammation. However, it is also noted that while there is a considerable amount of research on the leaves, their ellagitannins have not been a prominent focus of research. This suggests that while laboratory experiments have indicated a medicinal effect of leoligin and other substances from edelweiss, further research is needed to confirm these effects in humans. The context also mentions that several studies have reported the beneficial effects of other plant extracts on various health conditions, but the mechanism of action is still unknown or the research is limited. This further supports the need for additional research to confirm the medicinal effects of these substances in humans."
Are amla supplements effective and safe in lowering high cholesterol?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The study indicates that supplementation of the diet with amla (emblica officinalis, gaertn.) has shown significant potential in reducing total cholesterol (TC) and triglyceride (TG) levels, as well as lipid ratios, atherogenic index of plasma (AIP), and apolipoprotein B/apolipoprotein A-I (apoB/apoA-I) in dyslipidemic persons. The plasma in vitro study also showed that amla improved the plasma malondialdehyde (MDA), protein carbonylation, total protein, and albumin levels. In 12 weeks, the major lipids such as TC, TG, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C) were significantly lower in the amla group as compared to the placebo group. The antioxidative property of amla is suggested to be the key to its therapeutic effect. The new food supplement, body lipid (BL), containing red yeast rice, berberine, coenzyme Q10, and hydroxytyrosol, showed a good efficacy and safety profile and can be considered an alternative to pharmacological treatment for patients with mild-to-moderate hypercholesterolemia."
Do Schuessler salts work? (alternative spellings: Schuessler salts or Schuessler salts),"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",NEI,NEI,NEI,"The provided context does not contain specific information regarding Schuessler salts, which are a set of 12 homeopathic cell salts developed by Dr. Wilhelm Heinrich Schuessler in the late 19th century. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether Schuessler salts work based solely on the given information."
"Can honey accelerate the healing of second degree burns with pain, redness and blisters?","['True', 'NEI', 'False']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"The context suggests that honey may improve healing times in mild to moderate superficial and partial thickness burns, which includes second degree burns, compared with some conventional dressings. The topical application of honey has been observed to have favorable influences on the various phases of burn and wound healing, thus accelerating the healing process. In acute wounds, specifically partial-thickness burns, honey might reduce time to healing compared with some conventional dressings. Evidence from animal studies and trials suggests that honey may accelerate wound healing. Honey applied topically on cutaneous wounds has been found to accelerate the healing processes and has beneficial effects on the skin as an antiseptic for wounds, burns, and ulcers, and as a healing promoter. Topical honey treatment has been shown to possess antimicrobial properties, promote autolytic debridement, stimulate growth of wound tissues to hasten healing, and to start the healing process in dormant wounds, stimulating anti-inflammatory activity that rapidly reduces pain, edema, and exudate production."
Does the additional offer of HIV self-testing cause more people to take an HIV test?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"Justification: The context suggests that the availability of HIV self-testing has the potential to increase the uptake of HIV testing services, particularly among those who may not otherwise test. This is supported by evidence from public pilot programs in sub-Saharan Africa showing high acceptability and feasibility of self-testing. Additionally, the context indicates that among Malawian adults offered HIV self-testing, optional home initiation of care compared with standard HIV care resulted in a significant increase in the proportion of adults initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART). This suggests that the additional offer of HIV self-testing may indeed cause more people to take an HIV test."
Is tick-borne tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) much milder in children than in adults?,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",Yes,No,No,"The context suggests that tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) in children is often considered more benign and milder than in adults, with a more favorable outcome. However, it is not accurate to state that TBE is ""much milder"" in children than in adults. The context also provides evidence that TBE in children can result in substantial morbidity and severe long-term neurological sequelae. Furthermore, the context indicates that TBE can cause a range of symptoms in children, from asymptomatic cases to severe injuries of the nervous system. Therefore, while TBE in children may be less severe than in adults on average, it is not accurate to describe it as ""much milder."""
Can anger over a long period of time increase the risk of heart attack???,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The evidence suggests that anger, particularly in the form of outbursts, is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events, including heart attacks. While the studies primarily focus on short-term effects, the findings indicate that a strong, angry temperament can place individuals at a higher risk for cardiac events. This suggests that prolonged anger could potentially increase the risk of heart attacks over time. However, more research is needed to establish a definitive link between long-term anger and heart attack risk."
Can lung cancer screening by computed tomography (CT) also do harm???,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"Justification: While low-dose computed tomography (CT) screening for lung cancer has been shown to reduce lung cancer mortality, it is not without potential harms. These include overdiagnosis, false positives, and invasive procedures for benign nodules. Overdiagnosis can lead to unnecessary treatment and associated complications, while false positives can cause anxiety and further invasive testing. The risks for false-positive results on lung cancer screening tests are substantial after only 2 annual examinations, particularly for low-dose CT. Further study is warranted to fully understand the economic, psychosocial, and physical burdens of these methods."
Does a patch with high-dose capsaicin relieve pain after shingles?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"The context indicates that a single application of a high-dose (8%) capsaicin patch has been used for pain relief in various neuropathic conditions, including postherpetic neuralgia, which is a complication of shingles. The patch has been shown to decrease sensitivity to pain produced by sharp mechanical stimuli and nearly eliminate heat-evoked pain within the injected area. Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies have been conducted to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of topical capsaicin in treating neuropathic pain, including postherpetic neuralgia. The results of these studies suggest that a high-dose capsaicin patch can provide pain relief after shingles."
Can regular consumption of chocolate prevent cardiovascular disease?,"['False', 'True', 'NEI']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"Previous epidemiological studies have suggested that regular consumption of chocolate may reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. Chocolate, particularly dark chocolate, contains high levels of stearic acid and antioxidant flavonoids, which have been shown to have potential beneficial effects on heart disease. Chocolate has been associated with decreased risks of coronary heart disease, stroke, and diabetes. It has also been shown to have beneficial effects on endothelial function, blood pressure, serum lipids, insulin resistance, and platelet function. In an animal model of atherosclerosis, cocoa powder, a key ingredient in chocolate, significantly inhibited atherosclerosis and improved cholesterol levels. However, it is important to note that while these studies suggest a potential preventive effect of chocolate on cardiovascular disease, further research is needed to fully understand the relationship between chocolate consumption and heart health."
Does taking vitamin D improve symptoms in the most common form of psoriasis?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",No,Yes,Yes,"The context suggests that vitamin D, in various forms, has been found to be beneficial in the treatment of psoriasis. Topical application of vitamin D analogues is a well-established and effective treatment for psoriasis vulgaris, the most common form of psoriasis. Furthermore, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, a hormonally active form of vitamin D3, has been reported to stimulate epidermal differentiation and effectively treat psoriatic lesions. The literature review also indicates that oral vitamin D supplementation can improve disease severity in patients with psoriasis. However, it is important to note that the serum level of vitamin D did not correlate with the severity of psoriasis in one study. Nonetheless, the overall evidence suggests that taking vitamin D, either topically or orally, can improve symptoms in the most common form of psoriasis."
Does the Aspire system help you lose weight?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"The Aspire system, also known as the AspireAssist system, has been shown to be an effective weight loss therapy for individuals with obesity. The system utilizes a customized percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube and an external device to aspirate approximately 30% of ingested calories after a meal, in conjunction with lifestyle counseling. This approach has been found to result in fewer calories consumed and modifications in lifestyle and mealtime behaviors, leading to weight loss. In a clinical study, subjects in the AspireAssist group lost 18.6% ± 2.3% of their body weight (49.0% ± 7.7% of excess weight loss [EWL]) after 1 year, compared to 5.9% ± 5.0% (14.9% ± 12.2% of EWL) in the lifestyle therapy group (p < .04). Additionally, 58.6% of participants in the AspireAssist group and 15.3% of participants in the lifestyle counseling group lost at least 25% of their excess body weight (p<0.001). These findings suggest that the Aspire system can be an effective weight loss therapy for individuals with obesity."
Do specially trained dogs reliably warn of dangerous hypoglycemia?,"['True', 'False', 'NEI']",NEI,Yes,Yes,", with limitations

     The scientific literature suggests that specially trained dogs can alert to hypoglycemia in individuals with type 1 diabetes. However, the reliability of these alerts varies, with sensitivity rates ranging from 22 to 100%. In one study, dogs provided timely alerts in 36% of all hypoglycemia events. Despite this variability, dog users reported high satisfaction and confidence in their dogs' ability to detect hypoglycemia. It is important to note that a dog alert alone is unlikely to be helpful in differentiating hypo-/hyper-/euglycemia due to a high false-positive rate. Therefore, while specially trained dogs can warn of dangerous hypoglycemia, their reliability is not absolute and should not be used as the sole method for detecting hypoglycemia."
Does removal and examination of the first lymph nodes after the prostate is affected by cancer (sentinel lymph nodes or sentinel lymph nodes) improve the chances of cure? (Reader Inquiry),"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The removal and examination of the first lymph nodes after the prostate is affected by cancer, known as sentinel lymph nodes, can improve the chances of cure. This is due to the high diagnostic accuracy of sentinel node biopsy in detecting positive lymph nodes in prostate cancer. In cases of positive sentinel nodes, extended lymph node dissection should be performed as tumor cells can also be detected in non-sentinel lymph nodes. The utility of this procedure lies in staging, disease prognosis, and treatment, as early dissection of involved lymph nodes can improve survival. Furthermore, in men with prostate specific antigen 20 ng/ml or less and biopsy Gleason score 7 or less, only sentinel nodes are removed. Given the significant limitations of preoperative imaging in detecting small metastases, pelvic lymph node dissection remains the only reliable staging method in clinically localized prostate cancer."
Can regular screening significantly reduce the risk of dying from prostate cancer?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",No,Yes,Yes,"The evidence from screening trials suggests a small but finite benefit from prostate cancer screening in terms of prostate cancer-specific mortality, with approximately 1 fewer prostate cancer death per 1000 men screened over 10 years. The European Randomised Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC) showed that prostate-specific antigen (PSA) based screening results in a significant prostate cancer mortality reduction. The implementation of PSA screening has coincided with a decrease in mortality rate from prostate cancer. However, it is important to note that PSA screening can lead to overdiagnosis and overtreatment, which can have negative consequences for patients. Therefore, while regular screening can reduce the risk of dying from prostate cancer, it is important to weigh the potential benefits against the potential harms."
Can the preventive intake of lysine prevent cold sores (lip herpes) and genital herpes? Can lysine help when the blisters are already there?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,", with a caveat

    The preventive intake of lysine may potentially prevent cold sores (lip herpes) and genital herpes, as it has been shown to suppress the clinical manifestations of herpesvirus infection. Lysine has an inhibitory effect on the multiplication of herpes simplex virus in cell cultures, and it has been found to accelerate recovery from herpes simplex infection and suppress recurrence. However, it is important to note that lysine supplementation appears to be ineffective for prophylaxis or treatment of herpes simplex lesions with doses of less than 1 g/d without low-arginine diets. Longer duration controlled studies of daily lysine doses exceeding 1.2 g/d are required to definitively test its role in herpes simplex prophylaxis.

    Regarding the use of lysine when the blisters are already present, the evidence is less clear. Lysine has been proposed for treating the clinical symptoms of recurrent herpes simplex labialis, but it has been found to have no effect on the rate of healing or on the appearance of the lesions at their worst. Therefore, while lysine may be beneficial in preventing the recurrence of herpes simplex infections, its effectiveness in treating existing lesions is not well established."
Can treatments with ultrasound relieve the pain of osteoarthritis?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"Justification: The context suggests that therapeutic ultrasound has been used in the treatment of osteoarthritis for the relief of symptoms and improvement of functional status. Recent high-level evidence favors therapeutic ultrasound for reducing pain in people with knee osteoarthritis. The results of a review suggest that therapeutic ultrasound may be beneficial for patients with osteoarthritis of the knee. The use of therapeutic ultrasound in accordance with the parameters used could be recommended during the treatment of individuals with knee osteoarthritis, as it significantly decreased the intensity of pain after the 5th session, and this reduction was maintained until the end of the intervention. In conclusion, the addition of therapeutic ultrasound to traditional physical therapy showed a longitudinal positive effect on pain, functional status, and physical quality of life in patients with hip osteoarthritis."
Is milk thistle extract an effective treatment for liver disease?,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",NEI,NEI,NEI,"Milk thistle extracts have been used as a ""liver tonic"" for centuries and are widely used as an alternative therapy for liver disease due to their purported antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and iron chelating properties. However, the evidence supporting the effectiveness of milk thistle extract for the treatment of liver disease is limited. Although milk thistle has reduced liver enzyme levels and demonstrated anti-inflammatory and T cell-modulating effects, it has not significantly altered the course of chronic liver disease. Preliminary clinical evaluations of milk thistle for cirrhosis of the liver indicate potential benefits in healthier patients with alcoholic cirrhosis. However, the lack of high-quality evidence to support this intervention highlights the need for further research. Data are too limited to exclude a substantial benefit or harm of milk thistle on mortality, and also to support recommending this herbal compound for the treatment of liver disease."
Can therapy with the radioactive gas radon noticeably alleviate pain in rheumatism-related joint inflammation (rheumatoid arthritis)?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",No,Yes,Yes,"The existing trials suggest a positive effect of radon therapy on pain in rheumatic diseases. Radon therapy, specifically at a concentration of 2000 bq/m(3), produced antinociceptive effects, lowering plasma tnf-α, ne and no levels, and restoring sod activity, as well as pain-related behavior. The results showed that radon inhalation inhibited formalin-induced inflammatory pain and produced antinociceptive effects, lowering serum tnf-α and no levels, and restoring antioxidative functions. In a mouse model of formalin-induced inflammatory pain, radon inhalation alleviated hyperalgesic conditions. Radiosynovectomy using beta-emitting radionuclides is a therapeutic approach to rheumatoid arthritis and other inflammatory arthropathies. Five clinical trials with a total of 338 patients and comparing the effect on pain of radon baths or radon speleotherapy with control intervention in degenerative spinal disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis met the inclusion criteria. The results showed that inhalation of 2000 bq/m(3) radon prevented and alleviated cci-induced neuropathic pain in mice."
Does focused ultrasound (HIFU) treatment reduce wrinkles and sagging of the skin?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) has been established as an effective treatment for facial wrinkles and laxity. It has been proven to provide safe and effective improvement in skin laxity and tightening with minimal adverse effects. HIFU has been shown to be beneficial for noninvasive skin tightening, collagen regeneration, and lower face contour improvement. Various HIFU devices have been introduced for improving skin laxity, with satisfactory results. HIFU can be used as a non-invasive skin tightening technique in Asian patients. The study further strengthens the view that HIFU is an effective and safe tool for localized fat reduction. HIFU is a novel treatment modality for skin laxity that produces thermal effects at various depths while sparing the overlying epidermis."
Can dementia be prevented?,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",No,Yes,Yes,"The context suggests that dementia prevention is possible, particularly in the preclinical stage, through the identification and manipulation of modifiable risk factors. These factors include low education, midlife hearing loss, obesity, hypertension, late-life depression, smoking, physical inactivity, diabetes, and social isolation. The prevention of dementia is critical, as current interventions are not able to modify the disease. Vascular risk factor management, lifestyle changes, and drugs could be employed together to delay the onset of dementia syndromes. However, the 2017 National Academy of Medicine report concluded that the current evidence is limited and there are no specific interventions to warrant a public health recommendation for dementia prevention. Therefore, while dementia prevention is possible, more research is needed to clarify the potential of these factors to mitigate risk and determine the mechanisms that link these factors to dementia."
Do preparations containing rockrose have a preventive or soothing effect on colds (chills) and other upper respiratory tract infections? Can they protect against infections with the coronavirus?,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",NEI,NEI,NEI,"The context provided does not contain any information regarding the effects of preparations containing rockrose on colds, chills, or other upper respiratory tract infections. Therefore, it is not possible to determine if such preparations have a preventive or soothing effect on these conditions or if they can protect against infections with the coronavirus. The context does, however, provide information on the use of vitamin C and zinc lozenges for reducing the duration of cold symptoms, as well as the use of echinacea purpurea for the prevention and treatment of common colds, coughs, bronchitis, and other upper respiratory infections."
"Does Active Surveillance reduce the likelihood of becoming impotent or incontinence, i.e. unintentional urine leakage ??","['NEI', 'True', 'False']",Yes,NEI,NEI,"The provided context does not contain information regarding the effects of Active Surveillance on urinary incontinence or impotence. Active Surveillance is a strategy for monitoring prostate cancer, rather than treating it immediately. The context focuses on the effects of conservative management and surgical interventions for urinary incontinence after prostatectomy, but does not discuss the impact of Active Surveillance on these outcomes. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether Active Surveillance reduces the likelihood of becoming impotent or experiencing unintentional urine leakage based on the given information."
Can shoe insoles relieve pain in people with foot deformities other than high arch?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The context suggests that shoe insoles can indeed relieve pain in people with foot deformities other than high arch. For instance, therapeutic footwear with specially-made insoles is often used in people with diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis to relieve ulcer risks and pain due to high pressures from areas beneath bony prominences of the foot. In-shoe foot orthoses improve conditions such as plantar heel pain (fasciitis), probably due to their ability to raise the medial longitudinal arch of the foot and lower the stress on the plantar tissues. Custom molded insoles with metatarsal supports are used to redistribute excessive loading under the metatarsal heads in patients with metatarsalgia. Orthoses can help alleviate pain that stems from abnormal foot biomechanics, such as overpronation or rigid pes cavus. After using the dynamic impression insole, the mean pain score was significantly reduced. These findings indicate that shoe insoles can be beneficial in managing pain associated with various foot deformities."
Do sweeteners increase the risk of type 2 diabetes or sugar metabolism disorders?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages has been shown to increase the incidence of type 2 diabetes, largely in American populations. In adjusted models, a daily increment of 336g (12oz) in sugar-sweetened and artificially sweetened soft drink consumption was associated with hazard ratios for type 2 diabetes of 1.22 (95% CI 1.09, 1.38) and 1.52 (95% CI 1.26, 1.83), respectively. After further adjustment for energy intake and BMI, the association of sugar-sweetened soft drinks with type 2 diabetes persisted (HR 1.18, 95% CI 1.06, 1.32), but the association of artificially sweetened soft drinks became statistically not significant (HR 1.11, 95% CI 0.95, 1.31). Recent data suggest that artificial sweeteners may impact intestinal glucose absorption and lead to glucose intolerance."
Does the plant substance nobiletin contained in mandarins protect against weight gain?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"Nobiletin, a flavonoid found in citrus peels, has been shown to possess various biological activities, including the prevention of diet-induced weight gain in rodents. The significant effect of naringenin, a related citrus flavonoid, is also the prevention of weight gain, which can confer metabolic protection. Nobiletin has been studied for its therapeutic effects, including its potential to alleviate high-fat diet-induced nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and metabolic dysfunction in rats. This is achieved by significantly reducing adiposity, hyperlipidemia, insulin resistance, and hepatic lipids content. Therefore, it can be inferred that nobiletin, found in mandarins, may protect against weight gain."
Do phthalates reduce the likelihood of pregnancy in women?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The scientific evidence suggests that certain phthalates, such as di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) metabolites, may have an adverse effect on female fecundity, as indicated by prolonged time to pregnancy (TTP). While menstrual cycle-specific estimates of urinary phthalate metabolites were not associated with detrimental alterations in follicular-phase length, time to pregnancy, or early pregnancy loss, DEHP metabolites were associated with reduced early loss. These findings suggest that exposure to certain phthalates during pregnancy may be associated with an elevated risk of adverse reproductive outcomes, including reduced fecundity. However, further research is needed to confirm these findings and to determine the mechanisms underlying the potential effects of phthalates on female reproduction."
Can serious problems occur after stopping antidepressants?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"The discontinuation of antidepressants can lead to a variety of withdrawal reactions, including dizziness, weakness, nausea, headache, lethargy, insomnia, anxiety, poor concentration, and paresthesias. These symptoms can start within a few days to a few weeks after ceasing the drug and persist for days to weeks. Rapid discontinuation of some psychotropic medications is also associated with an increased risk of early illness recurrence. While serious problems are rare, they can occur, and patients should be closely monitored during the discontinuation process. Additionally, the long-term use of antidepressants may impair recovery and increase the risk of rehospitalization in patients with both primarily affective and non-affective disorders. Therefore, it is important to consider the potential risks and benefits of discontinuing antidepressants and to work closely with a healthcare provider to develop a safe and effective plan for discontinuation."
Do saw palmetto preparations help with benign prostate enlargement?,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",No,Yes,Yes,"The context suggests that saw palmetto preparations have been demonstrated to be effective in reducing symptoms associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Saw palmetto is the most popular herbal supplement used to treat symptoms of BPH, and its use is safe with no recognized adverse effects. Studies, including a randomized clinical trial, have shown that saw palmetto extract can lead to subjective and objective improvement in men with lower urinary tract symptoms attributed to BPH. However, recent clinical trials have questioned the efficacy of saw palmetto at standard doses (320 mg/d). Nonetheless, saw palmetto extracts are widely used in Europe and North America to treat the urinary symptoms associated with BPH, and it is used by over 2 million men in the United States for the treatment of BPH."
Do irradiations with cold red light help with chronic gingivitis?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",No,Yes,Yes,"The context suggests that irradiations with cold red light, specifically low-level laser therapy, can be a beneficial adjunct to nonsurgical treatment of chronic periodontitis on a short-term basis. This is supported by a study that showed suppression of cox-2 in gingival tissue after low-level laser treatment as an adjunct to scaling and root planing (srp). Additionally, a clinical trial evaluated the effects of a combination of photodynamic therapy with low-level laser therapy as an adjunct to nonsurgical treatment of chronic periodontitis. The use of lasers as a monotherapy has also been shown to reduce probing pocket depths and increase clinical attachment levels after treatment of patients suffering from chronic periodontitis. However, further studies are required to assess the long-term effectiveness of the combination of photodynamic therapy with low-level laser therapy as an adjunct in nonsurgical treatment of periodontitis."
Can eating broccoli or broccoli sprouts improve gastritis symptoms?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The results indicate that broccoli consumption, particularly broccoli sprouts, can have a positive impact on gastrointestinal health. This is supported by the finding that consumption of oral broccoli sprouts was associated with the eradication of H. pylori infection, a known cause of gastritis, in three out of nine patients. Furthermore, broccoli is rich in antioxidant and anti-inflammatory phytochemicals, which could potentially alleviate gastritis symptoms. The study also suggests that broccoli consumption may decrease the abundance of certain microbial families, such as Erysipelotrichaceae, which have been linked to inflammatory bowel diseases. Therefore, it can be inferred that eating broccoli or broccoli sprouts may improve gastritis symptoms."
Does wheat make you fat and sick?,"['NEI', 'False', 'True']",NEI,NEI,NEI,"The claim that wheat consumption makes people sick and fat is not fully supported by the available scientific evidence. While wheat is a common cause of food-related allergies and intolerances, and its ingestion is associated with gastrointestinal symptoms such as bloating and abdominal pain, it is not clear whether these wheat-related disorders lead to adverse health effects such as cardiovascular risk and nutritional deficiencies. In fact, wheat is an important source of nutrients, including protein, B vitamins, minerals, and bioactive components. Therefore, it is not accurate to say that wheat consumption makes people sick and fat. However, it is important to note that some individuals may have wheat-related disorders, such as food allergy to wheat, and these individuals may experience adverse health effects from wheat consumption."
Do hops as a single active ingredient help with sleep problems???,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The data suggests that hops extract has hypothermic effects, which are possibly mediated through activation of melatonin receptors. This is supported by the significant decrease in body temperature in male mice after oral administration of hops extract. Additionally, hops has been used in traditional European medicine as a mild sedative for the treatment of anxiety, nervousness, and insomnia. The beneficial effects of hops as a sleeping aid agree with its indication for anxiety/mood disorders and restlessness, as approved by the German Commission E. Furthermore, daily supplementation with a hops dry extract has been shown to significantly improve symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress in otherwise healthy young adults over a 4-week period. Therefore, it can be concluded that hops as a single active ingredient may help with sleep problems."
3. does vaccination against rotavirus increase the risk of intestinal intussusception in infants?,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",Yes,No,No,"The results of a systematic review and meta-analysis suggest that monovalent, pentavalent, monovalent human-bovine, oral bovine pentavalent, and human neonatal rotavirus vaccination was not associated with an elevated risk of intussusception among neonates or infants. Although some studies have shown an association between vaccination with the rotavirus vaccine and the development of intussusception, the risk of intussusception was not increased compared with infants who did not receive the rotavirus vaccine. In infants with intestinal failure, rotavirus vaccination appears to be safe and immunogenic. The hypothesis that rotavirus vaccines are associated with an increased risk of intussusception adverse events was tested, but no significant association was found. In some settings, rotavirus vaccines have been associated with a low-level risk of intussusception, but this has not been confirmed in large trials before licensure."
Can washing hands with antibacterial soaps or wash lotions containing triclosan or triclocarban prevent the risk of contracting diseases in the household?,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",No,No,No,"The use of antibacterial soaps or wash lotions containing triclosan or triclocarban has not been scientifically proven to prevent the risk of contracting diseases in the household. A double-blinded, randomized clinical trial of hands of primary caretakers in 238 inner city households showed that antibacterial product use did not lead to a significant increase in antimicrobial drug resistance after 1 year, nor did it have an effect on bacterial susceptibility to triclosan. Although there was an increasing trend in the association between triclosan and bacterial susceptibility to antibiotic, there was no statistically significant association. Additionally, both agents have a risk of bacterial resistance, which is higher for chlorhexidine than triclosan. Therefore, it is not conclusive that handwashing with soap is more effective at reducing contamination with bacteria associated with diarrhea than using water only."
Does deuterium-reduced water improve disease progression in cancer???,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The context suggests that deuterium-depleted water (DDW) has demonstrated anti-cancer effects in both in vitro and in vivo studies. The consumption of DDW has been shown to reduce the growth rate of the L929 fibroblast cell line and inhibit tumor growth in xenotransplanted mice. Furthermore, DDW has been found to exhibit anti-tumor properties in natural water with 65% of the deuterium concentration depleted. In oncological patients who also suffered from diabetes and were treated with DDW, an improvement of glucose metabolism was observed. The experimental data showed that a physiological solution prepared on DDW during induced apoptosis activates the DNA repair system, significantly reducing the number of single-stranded DNA breaks. The molecular mechanism of the anticancer effect of DDW remains unclear, but it is proposed to link cancer prevention and treatment using natural ketogenic diets, low deuterium drinking water, as well as DDW production as the mitochondrial downstream mechanism of targeted anti-cancer drugs such as Avastin and Glivec. The patients received 1.5 l of water with reduced deuterium content daily for 90 days, and the role of naturally occurring deuterium in living organisms has been examined by using DDW instead of water containing the natural abundance of deuterium. The objective was to investigate whether DDW can overturn reverse manganese-induced reduction in life span, using the Caenorhabditis elegans as a model system. The anti-cancer activity of DDW has been shown by its preferential cell-growth inhibition to human tongue carcinoma cells over normal human tongue cells. In conclusion, the context suggests that D"
Do gastrointestinal surgeries (bariatric surgeries) improve symptoms of type 2 diabetes?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"Gastrointestinal surgeries, also known as bariatric surgeries, have been shown to improve symptoms of type 2 diabetes. These procedures have been found to induce remission of type 2 diabetes in obese diabetic patients, and they also concomitantly improve other metabolic diseases such as nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, cardiovascular diseases, and hyperlipidemia. The weight-loss independent improvement of glycemic control observed after these procedures has led to the discussion of introducing bariatric surgery as a treatment for type 2 diabetes in patients with a body mass index < 35 kg/m(2). The use of gastric bypass as the preferred bariatric procedure for patients with obesity and type 2 diabetes has been found to improve diabetes care and reduce related societal costs. The underlying mechanism for this improvement is unclear, but nutrient interaction with the mid-gut may play a role in improving type 2 diabetes mellitus after bariatric surgery. Open-label studies have shown that bariatric surgery causes remission of diabetes in some patients with BMI <35 kg/m(2). Gastric bypass was found to be superior to sleeve gastrectomy for remission of type 2 diabetes at 1 year after surgery, and the two procedures had a similar beneficial effect on β-cell function."
Does hypnosis help with smoking cessation?,"['True', 'False', 'NEI']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"Efficacious

     Hypnosis has been widely promoted as a method for aiding smoking cessation, and several studies have reported decreased craving after hypnosis. However, the scientific evidence supporting hypnosis as a specific and efficacious treatment for smoking cessation is limited. A review of 59 studies found that hypnosis cannot be considered a specific and efficacious treatment for smoking cessation. Nevertheless, it seems justified to classify hypnosis as a ""possibly efficacious"" treatment for smoking cessation. Further research is needed to evaluate the effects of hypnosis on smoking cessation and to optimize hypnotic treatments for mental disorders."
Is blue light treatment as effective as UV light or other established therapies for psoriasis?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"Clinical investigations have demonstrated that blue light irradiation is effective in reducing the severity of psoriasis vulgaris. Blue light irradiation has been shown to reduce the proliferation of keratinocytes and modulate T-cell immune response in vitro, and has been proven effective in the treatment of acne vulgaris. The efficacy, safety, and convenience of targeted UVB therapy with quasi-monochromatic light suggest that it is a useful treatment option for patients with limited psoriatic plaques. Ultraviolet B (UVB) is a highly effective, relatively safe, affordable, and widely used therapeutic option for moderate psoriasis. The modeling approach used in these studies provides a framework for testing diverse hypotheses on the underlying mechanism of blue light-based phototherapy and for designing effective strategies for the treatment of psoriasis. These results expand the properties of narrow-band blue light in modulating the inflammatory process and will facilitate testing of its phototherapeutic applications in different inflammatory skin conditions."
Are international travel restrictions and border health checks effective in curbing the spread of covid-19?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"Justification: The context suggests that various strategies, including travel restrictions and border health checks, have been implemented to reduce and slow the spread of COVID-19. These measures, such as the closure or severe restriction of border transit, quarantines, and self-isolation, have been used to limit the further spread of the virus. The effectiveness of these measures is supported by the fact that they have been recommended by the World Health Organization and adopted by numerous countries worldwide. Furthermore, the context indicates that these measures have led to a significant reduction in international passenger traffic, suggesting their effectiveness in curbing the spread of COVID-19."
Is acupuncture for chronic pain more effective than placebo acupuncture treatment?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"The evidence suggests that acupuncture is associated with improved pain outcomes compared to sham-acupuncture and no-acupuncture control. In eight out of sixteen trials comparing true and sham acupuncture in migraine and tension-type headache patients, true acupuncture was reported to be significantly superior. In four trials, there was a trend in favor of true acupuncture, and in two trials, there was no difference between the two interventions. Additionally, acupuncture was found to be more effective in improving pain than no acupuncture treatment in patients with chronic low back pain. However, the role of the placebo effect in acupuncture's efficacy remains unclear."
Can induction of labor prevent infant deaths in pregnancies that go beyond the estimated due date? Does it reduce the number of neonatal intensive care unit stays?,"['True', 'False', 'NEI']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"The available evidence suggests that a policy of labour induction compared with expectant management is associated with fewer perinatal deaths. This finding is supported by a recent randomized controlled trial that reported early term induction of labor reduced cesarean section rates and infant morbidity. A policy of labour induction at 41 completed weeks or beyond was associated with fewer (all-cause) perinatal deaths compared with a policy of expectant management. Furthermore, fewer babies in the labour induction group had meconium aspiration syndrome compared with a policy of expectant management. However, the absolute risk of perinatal death is small, and the number needed to treat to benefit with induction of labour in order to prevent one perinatal death was 410. The evidence also suggests that induction of labor at or near term does not increase cesarean delivery. Although some infant morbidities such as meconium aspiration syndrome were reduced with a policy of post-term labour induction, no significant differences in the rate of neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission were seen."
Can vitamin supplements protect against life-threatening diseases such as cancer or cardiovascular disease?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",No,No,No,"The evidence suggests that while antioxidant vitamins, whether obtained through regular diet or as food supplements, may have a role in the prevention of cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and cataract formation, their supplementation has not been proven to have beneficial effects in the primary prevention of myocardial infarction and stroke. This is based on randomized controlled trials, which are considered the gold standard for evaluating the effectiveness of interventions. Furthermore, high doses of vitamin supplementation may cause toxic effects in some instances. Therefore, it cannot be concluded that vitamin supplements protect against life-threatening diseases such as cancer or cardiovascular disease."
"Does colloidal silver (""silver water"") work against infection with the coronavirus or other pathogens? Does it have any other health benefits?","['NEI', 'True', 'False']",NEI,NEI,NEI,"Colloidal silver, also known as ""silver water,"" has been used as an antimicrobial and disinfectant agent for many decades. It has a broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity against aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, and its antibacterial action is utilized in numerous consumer products and medical devices. Silver ions and nanoparticles have been found to possess superb antimicrobial activities, and they have been used in water and air filtration to eliminate microorganisms. However, there is very little data about the systemic absorption and toxicity of silver in vivo.

     Regarding the question of whether colloidal silver works against infection with the coronavirus or other pathogens, there is not enough information to make a definitive statement. While silver has demonstrated great efficacy against a broad range of microorganisms, its effectiveness against the coronavirus or other specific pathogens has not been established. Furthermore, the use of colloidal silver as a treatment for infections has not been approved by regulatory agencies such as the FDA. Therefore, it is recommended to consult with a healthcare professional before using colloidal silver as a treatment for any medical condition."
Can zeolite alleviate or prevent health problems?,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The context suggests that zeolites, including zeolite 4a and clinoptilolite, have been shown to exhibit diverse biological activities that may be beneficial for human health. These activities include antioxidant and anti-cancer effects, as well as the ability to maintain general health and well-being in mice. Zeolites have also been shown to prevent iron-induced deleterious effects following iron overload, and may have translational potential for use in cases of human iron overload. In addition, zeolites have been found to improve intestinal wall integrity and decrease biomarkers of intestinal wall permeability and parameters of oxidation and inflammation in aerobically trained individuals. Zeolites have also been used as detoxifying agents in humans and have been suggested as a means of decreasing the uptake of radio-caesium by humans and domestic animals. These findings suggest that zeolites may have the potential to alleviate or prevent certain health problems."
Does curcumin protect people with already diagnosed dementia from further decline in mental abilities???,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",No,NEI,NEI,"The provided context discusses the therapeutic potential of curcumin in preventing cognitive decline and improving memory in aged mice, as well as its neuroprotective effects against neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. The studies mentioned in the context focus on the effects of curcumin on memory decline in aged mice and its potential to ameliorate memory deficits by activating the nnos activity in specific brain regions. However, the context does not provide direct evidence on the effects of curcumin on people with already diagnosed dementia. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether curcumin protects people with already diagnosed dementia from further decline in mental abilities based solely on the provided context. Further research is needed to investigate the potential benefits of curcumin in managing dementia in humans."
Is electrical muscle stimulation (EMS) in combination with ordinary fitness training more efficient than fitness training alone?,"['True', 'False', 'NEI']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"Electrical muscle stimulation (EMS) in combination with ordinary fitness training has been shown to be more efficient than fitness training alone in improving muscle strength, functional performances, and muscle mass. EMS can effectively improve muscle strength when used alone or superimposed over voluntary contraction. It has been observed to improve functional performances more effectively than voluntary training and counteract fast type muscle fibre atrophy. Moderate-frequency combined EMS training has led to significant improvements in physical fitness and lean body mass. However, it should be noted that EMS should not be regarded as a replacement for exercise training per se, as the beneficial effect of exercise training is not just relying on building muscle mass but also exerts positive effects on endothelial, myocardial, and cognitive function."
Are electric cigarettes less harmful than tobacco smoking?,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The evidence suggests that electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) are considered less harmful than traditional tobacco smoking due to the lack of combustion and the absence of tobacco-specific toxicants. E-cigarettes provide nicotine in a vapor form, which is considered less harmful than the smoke from combustible cigarettes because it does not contain the toxins found in tobacco smoke. E-cigarettes are devoid of many harmful constituents found in cigarette smoke and are therefore being positioned as a safer alternative to tobacco smoke. The use of e-cigarettes is popular because of the perception that they are less addictive and safer compared to traditional cigarettes. However, it is important to note that e-cigarettes are not completely harmless and their long-term health effects are not yet fully understood."
Does hydroxychloroquine prevent covid-19 infection???,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",No,NEI,NEI,"The efficacy of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) as a prophylactic agent against COVID-19 remains uncertain. While some studies suggest that HCQ may serve as a potential prophylactic agent, especially for those at high risk, other studies have demonstrated either no or a small benefit. In vitro studies have shown virucidal action of HCQ against SARS-CoV-2, but its role as post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) remains inconclusive. Clinical trials are underway to determine the prophylactic/therapeutic efficacy of HCQ for COVID-19 management. However, based on the available evidence, it is not possible to definitively state that HCQ prevents COVID-19 infection."
Can cancer be effectively treated with vitamin C infusions?,"['NEI', 'False', 'True']",NEI,NEI,NEI,"The anti-cancer effect of high doses of intravenous vitamin C (high-dose vitamin C) remains controversial despite growing evidence that high-dose vitamin C exerts anti-tumorigenic activity by increasing the amount of reactive oxygen species in cancer cells without meaningful toxicities. Altered metabolism of cancer cells by vitamin C can be beneficial by itself and promote activity of specific drugs. In vivo, intratumoral delivery of vitamin C delayed tumor growth in murine solid tumor models. However, the data are controversial and there is incomplete knowledge of what physiological mechanisms might be involved in any response. Therefore, it is not possible to definitively state that cancer can be effectively treated with vitamin C infusions."
"Does the extract of the plant Salacia reticulata in combination with vitamin D (""Exadipin"") help to lose weight?","['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The extract of the plant Salacia reticulata, in combination with vitamin D, has been shown to have therapeutic effects on obesity and metabolic disorders. The extract enhances lipogenesis genes and suppresses lipolysis genes through the activation of AMPKα in adipocytes. In animal studies, the extract of Salacia reticulata produced a reduction in body weight and mesenteric fat accumulation, as well as an improvement in abnormal glucose metabolism. In human studies, participants who consumed Salacia reticulata lost more weight than those on a control diet. The combination of Salacia reticulata and vitamin D may be a useful dietary addition to conventional therapy in the management of obesity."
Does industrially highly processed food increase the risk of cancer?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"Numerous epidemiological studies have demonstrated a link between excessive meat consumption, particularly red and processed meat, and the incidence of various cancers, especially colorectal cancer. The World Health Organization has found that the consumption of processed meat and potentially red meat promotes carcinogenesis and can increase the risk of colorectal cancer. The observed growth of cancer incidence in certain regions has been linked to frequent consumption of 'unhealthy' food. Ultra-processed food has low nutritional quality, is associated with the development of chronic diseases, and may increase exposure to chemicals used in food packaging and production. Carcinogenic effects in humans are ascribed to processed meat by organizations such as the International Agency for Research on Cancer, World Cancer Research Fund, and American Institute for Cancer Research."
Is strophanthin an effective cardiovascular drug?,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",NEI,NEI,NEI,"The context does not provide explicit information regarding the effectiveness of strophanthin as a cardiovascular drug. However, it does mention strophanthidin, a compound related to strophanthin, which has no demonstrable effect on membrane conductance apart from that due to the observed depolarization. This suggests that strophanthidin, and by extension strophanthin, may not have a significant effect on cardiovascular function. However, without more specific information about strophanthin, it is not possible to definitively determine its effectiveness as a cardiovascular drug."
Do cell phones promote the development and growth of tumors in the head?,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",NEI,NEI,NEI,"The evidence regarding the association between mobile phone use and the risk of intracranial tumors is mixed. While some case-control studies have found a positive association, others have reported no significant association. The International Agency for Research on Cancer has classified radiofrequency electromagnetic fields as 'possibly' carcinogenic to humans, but the evidence is not conclusive. Some epidemiological studies suggest that mobile phones may cause glioblastomas in humans, but the data is limited and does not offer information on the risk related to more prolonged and/or heavy use. The Interphone epidemiological study investigated the association between the estimated radio frequency dose from mobile phones and the risk of developing a brain tumor, but methodological deficits limit the conclusions that can be drawn from the study. In conclusion, the evidence is not sufficient to evaluate the risks among long-term, heavy users and for potentially long induction periods."
Do dietary supplements with amino acids and proteins help against muscle atrophy in old age (sarcopenia)?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The scientific literature supports the notion that dietary supplements with amino acids and proteins can aid in counteracting muscle atrophy in old age, also known as sarcopenia. Amino acids, such as arginine and lysine, have been shown to enhance muscle protein synthesis and mitochondrial function. Furthermore, beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate (HMB) can slow protein breakdown, thus improving strength and functionality. Nutritional supplements, including protein and amino acid supplements, can preserve muscle strength, although the effect on function may vary. Additionally, branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) have been found to alleviate sarcopenia by promoting muscle protein synthesis and improving iron status. Resistance exercise and milk-based protein supplementation have also been demonstrated as significant countermeasures for sarcopenia and the loss of muscle strength."
Does vitamin D prevent covid-19 disease? Does vitamin D mitigate the course of Covid 19 disease?,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",NEI,NEI,NEI,"The context suggests that vitamin D may have a potential role in reducing the risk and severity of COVID-19 due to its immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory properties. However, it is not conclusive whether vitamin D can prevent COVID-19 disease or mitigate its course. The context mentions that there is a strong plausible biological hypothesis and evolving epidemiological data supporting a role for vitamin D in COVID-19, but further confirmation is needed. Additionally, the context indicates that vitamin D deficiency may be associated with an increased risk of severe COVID-19 infection, but it does not provide conclusive evidence that vitamin D supplementation can prevent or treat COVID-19. Therefore, it is not possible to definitively answer the question based on the information provided in the context."
Is Bulletproof Coffee recommended?,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",NEI,NEI,NEI,"Justification: The context does not provide specific information on Bulletproof Coffee, which is a type of coffee that includes butter and medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) oil. Therefore, it is not possible to definitively state whether Bulletproof Coffee is recommended or not based on the provided context. However, it is known that coffee in general has potential health benefits, such as being a rich source of dietary antioxidants and having anti-hypertensive effects. It is important to note that individual responses to coffee and its various forms may vary, and it is always recommended to consult with a healthcare provider before making significant changes to one's diet."
Are detox cures good for health?,"['NEI', 'False', 'True']",NEI,NEI,NEI,"The available evidence suggests that detox diets and supplements may have potential benefits for improving subjective health reports and enhancing liver detoxification capacity. However, the clinical evidence supporting the use of these diets is limited and often hampered by flawed methodologies and small sample sizes. A 7-day detoxification program has been shown to improve well-being and reduce participant symptomology, but the long-term effects and potential risks of such programs are not well-established. Additionally, while certain foods such as coriander, nori, and olestra have shown preliminary evidence of detoxification properties, the majority of these studies have been performed in animals. Therefore, it is not possible to definitively conclude whether detox cures are good for health based on the available evidence. Further research is needed to fully understand the potential benefits and risks of detox diets and supplements."
Does leaky gut syndrome cause health complaints or diseases?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The 'leaky gut' syndrome, characterized by an impaired gut-blood barrier, has been associated with intestinal and extra-intestinal diseases. This condition, also known as increased intestinal permeability, is a common feature in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. While it is not the sole cause of these diseases, it contributes to their manifestation and progression. The disruption of the intestinal barrier allows for the translocation of harmful substances, such as bacteria and toxins, into the bloodstream, triggering an immune response and inflammation. This can lead to a range of health complaints, including abdominal pain, bloating, and changes in bowel habits, as seen in functional gastrointestinal disorders like irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). It is important to note that while dietary factors can help manage symptoms and improve gut health, they are not a cure for these conditions. The relationship between 'leaky gut' and health complaints is complex and multifactorial, involving not only the gut barrier but also gut function, motility, and the gut-brain axis."
Can a treatment with singing bowls relieve pain?,"['True', 'False', 'NEI']",No,Yes,Yes,"The evidence from peer-reviewed studies suggests that singing bowl therapies may have positive health effects, including pain reduction. In one study, both singing and painting interventions led to significant pain reduction in patients with chronic pain. However, due to the limited number of studies and potential methodological biases, further research is needed to make evidence-based recommendations for the use of singing bowl therapies in pain management."
Does deuterium-reduced water prevent cancer?,"['True', 'False', 'NEI']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The context suggests that deuterium-depleted water (DDW) has been shown to have anti-cancer effects in various in vitro, in vivo, and clinical studies. The growth rate of the L929 fibroblast cell line was significantly decreased, and tumor growth in xenotransplanted mice was inhibited. DDW has also been found to delay tumor progression in mice, dogs, cats, and humans. The inhibitory effects of DDW on human lung cancer cell lines and the possible mechanisms underlying these effects have been investigated. The consumption of DDW has been shown to reduce the content of deuterium in biological fluids and the d/h gradient value, which indicates an increase in the efficiency of defensive systems of the cell. Although the molecular mechanism remains unclear, DDW has been proposed to link cancer prevention and treatment using natural ketogenic diets, low deuterium drinking water, and as the mitochondrial downstream mechanism of targeted anti-cancer drugs."
"Does astaxanthin protect against cardiovascular disease, cancer or prolong life?","['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"Astaxanthin, a xanthophyll carotenoid, has been shown to exhibit various pharmacological activities, including anti-oxidative, anti-tumor, and anti-inflammatory effects. Its unique chemical features have led to its proposal as a suitable preventive and therapeutic agent in cardiovascular disease. Astaxanthin has been reported to have potent antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, antitumor, and immunomodulatory activities, making it a multi-target pharmacological agent against various diseases. The carotenoid pigment has been shown to effectively suppress reactive oxygen and has been reported to have a protective effect against ischemia/reperfusion injury and improvement in cognitive function. Therefore, it can be inferred that astaxanthin may protect against cardiovascular disease and cancer, and potentially prolong life."
Can taking vitamin C after the onset of a cold relieve symptoms or shorten the illness?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",No,Yes,Yes,"The context suggests that taking vitamin C after the onset of a cold may relieve symptoms and shorten the illness. Placebo-controlled trials have shown that vitamin C supplementation decreases the duration and severity of common cold infections. In children, 1 to 2 g/day of vitamin C shortened colds by 18%. The consistent effect of vitamin C on the duration and severity of colds in regular supplementation studies indicates that it may be worthwhile for common cold patients to test on an individual basis whether therapeutic vitamin C is beneficial for them. The failure of vitamin C supplementation to reduce the incidence of colds in the general population indicates that routine vitamin C supplementation is not justified, yet vitamin C may be useful for people exposed to brief periods of severe physical exercise."
Is surgery for an anterior cruciate ligament tear (by replacing the broken anterior cruciate ligament with tendon tissue from another part of the leg) followed by physical therapy better than physical therapy alone?,"['NEI', 'False', 'True']",No,No,No,"The effectiveness of surgical treatment compared to conservative treatment for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries remains controversial. A randomized controlled trial found no significant difference in outcomes between early ACL reconstruction (ACLR) with rehabilitation and optional delayed ACLR with rehabilitation. Furthermore, a quasi-randomized trial of 167 people with complete ACL rupture found no difference in the return to sports activities between those treated surgically and those treated conservatively. Therefore, it cannot be definitively stated that surgery for an ACL tear followed by physical therapy is superior to physical therapy alone."
"Can a bioresonance device like ""Bioscan"" or ""Vieva Vital Analyser"" measure mineral and vitamin deficiencies or detect health problems?","['NEI', 'True', 'False']",No,NEI,NEI,"The context provided does not explicitly mention the ""Bioscan"" or ""Vieva Vital Analyser"" devices, making it impossible to definitively state whether these specific devices can measure mineral and vitamin deficiencies or detect health problems. However, the context does discuss the development of biosensors for real-time, on-line quantitative analysis of key biochemical parameters, including 25-oh vitamin D, which is an important factor in avoiding skeletal damage and various pathological conditions. The context also mentions the potential use of biosensors in clinical practice and their ability to be configured into simple, rapid, and cost-effective laboratory devices. Therefore, it is plausible that similar devices, such as ""Bioscan"" or ""Vieva Vital Analyser,"" could potentially measure mineral and vitamin deficiencies or detect health problems. However, without specific information about these devices, a definitive answer cannot be provided."
Can Botox injections prevent migraine attacks?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"The efficacy of Botulinum Toxin Type A (Botox) in preventing migraine attacks has been investigated in several clinical studies. These studies have shown that Botox injections can significantly reduce migraine frequency, severity, and the need for acute medication. The treatment has been found to be safe and effective for patients with chronic migraine and other headache disorders. The mechanism of action is not fully understood, but it is known that the relaxation of the corrugator muscles is not solely responsible for the pain relief. Instead, Botox may have multiple targets in relieving migraine pain. In clinical trials, prevention of migraine attacks for 3 months or more has been observed in some patients following Botox injections."
Is plasma therapy for covid-19 effective in preventing deaths?,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",NEI,NEI,NEI,"The context suggests that convalescent plasma therapy has shown notable improvements in patients' clinical symptoms and biochemical parameters associated with COVID-19 infection. However, it is also stated that the use of convalescent plasma is still explorative in the context of COVID-19 and that formal proof of efficacy is still lacking. The incidence of all serious adverse events, including mortality rate, in the first 4 hours after transfusion was less than 1%. While convalescent plasma is emerging as a potentially safe and effective treatment option for patients severely or critically ill with COVID-19, there is a paucity of data identifying its therapeutic efficacy. Therefore, it cannot be definitively stated that plasma therapy for COVID-19 is effective in preventing deaths."
Can cancer be successfully fought with intentionally induced fever?,"['True', 'False', 'NEI']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The use of intentionally induced fever, also known as hyperthermia, has been considered for cancer therapy since the end of the 19th century. Heat has been shown to have a beneficial effect on malignancies and can enhance the anti-cancer effects of radiation and chemotherapeutic agents. Hyperthermia per se has been shown experimentally to be effective in some cancers. The mechanism of action of febrile infection in inducing spontaneous remission and regression of cancer has been proposed, and it is suggested that high fever may be a biomarker for improved survival in melanoma patients treated with IL-2/IFN."
Does short-term fasting improve quality of life in cancer?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The context suggests that short-term fasting may improve the quality of life in cancer patients. Preclinical data and a small number of clinical studies indicate that repeated short-term fasting may reduce the side effects of chemotherapy, enhance quality of life, and slow down tumor progression. Short-term fasting has been shown to protect normal cells and mice, but not cancer cells, against high-dose chemotherapy. In a study of six patients who underwent chemotherapy with or without fasting, a reduction in fatigue, weakness, and gastrointestinal side effects was reported while fasting. However, there is a lack of data from larger randomized trials on the effects of short-term fasting on quality of life, reduction of side effects during chemotherapy, and a possible reduction of tumor progression."
Can electrical brain stimulation reduce the amount of food eaten?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The evidence suggests that electrical brain stimulation, specifically transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), may reduce appetite and caloric intake. This is supported by studies showing that tDCS can decrease food craving, attentional bias to food, and actual food intake. Additionally, long-term electrical vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) has been shown to cause a reduction in body mass and decrease in food intake. The use of tDCS to suppress food cravings has been documented, although more evidence is needed to support its application in clinical practice. Furthermore, the study of the effects of tDCS on the left DLPFC in individuals with obesity showed an immediate effect on eating behavior and weight change. The use of VNS and high-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on the left DLPFC has also been shown to weaken food craving in eating disorders."
Is sex as good an endurance workout as running?,"['False', 'NEI', 'True']",No,NEI,NEI,"The context provided does not directly address the question of whether sexual activity is as good an endurance workout as running. However, it does provide information on the endurance performance of men and women in running. It is established that women have greater muscular endurance than men in low to moderate intensity contractions, and are less fatigable in single-joint exercises. Additionally, it is noted that women exhibit less peripheral fatigue in the plantar flexors than men after a 110-km ultra-trail-running race. These findings suggest that women may have a greater capacity for endurance in certain activities. However, without specific data on the physiological demands of sexual activity and how they compare to running, it is not possible to definitively answer the question."
Does the use of antibiotics in animal husbandry harm human health?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The use of antibiotics in animal husbandry has been linked to the development and spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, posing a significant risk to human health. The widespread use of antibiotics in livestock for disease prevention and growth promotion has led to the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in both animals and humans. This is due to the selection of antibiotic resistance genes in animals, which can be transferred to humans through the consumption or handling of animal-derived food products. Furthermore, the use of antibiotics can disturb the intestinal microbial community, which plays a crucial role in maintaining animals' health. This disruption can have adverse human health consequences, as evidenced by the growing problem of antimicrobial resistance in human medicine. Therefore, it is clear that the use of antibiotics in animal husbandry can indeed harm human health."
