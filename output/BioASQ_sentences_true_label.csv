"A bite from the Lone Star Tick Amblyomma americanum, can cause the victim to become allergic to red meat, yes or no?","recent studies revealed that amblyomma or ixodes tick bites may cause red meat allergy, in which galactose-α-1,3-galactose (α-gal) is a major ige-binding epitope.  because red meat allergy after tick bites is a worldwide phenomenon, the objectives of this review were to describe the global epidemiology of red meat allergy after tick bites and its immunological mechanisms; to identify the human risk factors for red meat allergy after tick bites; to identify the most common tick vectors of red meat allergy worldwide; to describe the clinical manifestations, diagnostic confirmation, and management of patients with red meat allergy after tick bites; and to recommend strategies for the prevention of tick bites.  red meat allergy after tick bites represents an emerging threat from tick bites in addition to infectious diseases.  these findings provide a potential mechanistic connection between amblyomma bites and red meat hypersensitivity.  we report the case of a 56-year-old farmer with a history of frequent lone star tick bites who presented with a 7-year history of diffuse urticaria occurring hours after eating red meat.  recently described conditions such as southern tick-associated rash illness and anaphylaxis to red meat following tick bites have been attributed to the lone star tick.  a syndrome of mammalian meat allergy relating to ige specific for galactose-α-1,3-galactose (α-gal) was first reported 10 years ago in the southeastern united states and has been related to bites of the lone star tick (amblyomma americanum).  the major risk factors for red meat allergy after tick bites included male sex, non-b blood type, systemic mastocytosis, a bioprosthetic (bovine or porcine) heart valve, and preexisting allergies to gelatin or animal dander.  therefore, we speculated that tick bites may cause these meat allergies.  delayed anaphylaxis to mammalian meat is a newly recognized ige-mediated syndrome associated with lone star tick bites.  the lone star tick, amblyomma americanum, feeds upon a variety of hosts and is a known vector of several human pathogens.  sensitization to tick salivary gland protein containing α-gal is possibly a major etiology of red meat allergy; the carbohydrate plays a crucial role in its allergenicity.  development of specific ige antibodies to the oligosaccharide galactose-α-1, 3-galactose (α-gal) following tick bites has been shown to be the source of red meat allergy.  commonly referred to as 'red meat allergy', α-gal syndrome is precipitated by a lone star tick bite resulting in the formation of immunoglobulin e (ige) antibodies against the tick salivary glycoproteins and noncatarrhine mammalian tissue.  in addition to being a major nuisance biter, the lone star tick, amblyomma americanum (l.), is increasingly recognized as an important vector of pathogens affecting humans, domestic animals, and wildlife.  alpha-gal allergy, also known as red meat allergy or alpha-gal syndrome, can present after bites of certain tick species that contain galactose-alpha-1,3-galactose (alpha-gal) carbohydrate.  this brief report aims to raise awareness that recurrent delayed anaphylactic reactions to food can develop after tick bites.  red meat allergies have followed tick bites on every continent except antarctica.  amblyomma americanum (the lone star tick) is a broadly distributed tick that transmits multiple pathogens of humans and domestic animals.  tick bites can cause the alpha-gal syndrome, which is characterized by delayed anaphylactic reactions mainly to red meat and offal due to ige antibodies against mammalian galactose-alpha-1.3-galactose carbohydrate (alpha-gal). ||| ",yes
Are AAV vectors considered for the treatment of retinal dystrophies?,"recombinant adeno-associated virus (aav) has emerged as a promising vector for retinal gene delivery to restore visual function in certain forms of inherited retinal dystrophies.  gene transfer using adeno-associated viral (aav) vectors has been successfully applied in the retina for the treatment of inherited retinal dystrophies.  gene therapy using adeno-associated viral (aav) vectors for the treatment of retinal degenerations has shown safety and efficacy in clinical trials.  gene therapy vectors based on adeno-associated viruses (aavs) show promise for the treatment of retinal degenerative diseases.  recombinant adeno-associated viral (aav) vectors have become powerful gene delivery tools for the treatment of retinal degeneration in a variety of animal models that mimic corresponding human diseases.  this review will provide an overview of the properties of aav vectors followed by a detailed report of their use in retinal gene transfer for mendelian and non-mendelian disorders.  gene therapies using adeno-associated viruses (aavs) are among the most promising strategies to treat or even cure hereditary and acquired retinal diseases.  aav vectors possess a number of features that render them ideally suited for retinal gene therapy, including a lack of pathogenicity, minimal immunogenicity, and the ability to transduce postmitotic cells in a stable and efficient manner.  naturally occurring, rationally designed or in vitro evolved aav vectors are currently being utilized to transduce several different cell types in the retina and to treat a variety of animal models of retinal disease.  vectors derived from adeno-associated virus (aav) are currently the most promising vehicles for therapeutic gene delivery to the retina.  adeno-associated viruses (aavs) have recently emerged as the leading vector for retinal gene therapy.  adeno-associated virus (aav) vectors are the most promising vehicles for therapeutic gene delivery to the retina.  recombinant adeno-associated viral vectors (aav) are the most efficient tools to transfer genes in vivo to the retina.  capsid mutant aav vectors transduce human retinal cells and may be particularly suited to treat retinal degenerations in which high levels of transgene expression are required.  adeno-associated virus (aav) vector-based gene therapy is a promising treatment strategy for delivery of neurotrophic transgenes to retinal ganglion cells (rgcs) in glaucoma patients.  gene delivery vectors based on adeno-associated viruses (aav) have exhibited promise in both preclinical disease models and human clinical trials for numerous disease targets, including the retinal degenerative disorders leber's congenital amaurosis and choroideremia.  ocular gene therapy with recombinant adeno-associated virus (aav) has shown vector-mediated gene augmentation to be safe and efficacious in the retina in one set of diseases (retinitis pigmentosa and leber congenital amaurosis (lca) caused by rpe65 deficiency), with excellent safety profiles to date and potential for efficacy in several additional diseases.  recent studies showed compelling evidence of therapeutic efficacy in large animal models following the intravenous delivery of aav vectors expressing truncated forms of dystrophin.  vectors derived from adeno-associated viruses (aav) represent a promising tool for retinal gene transfer in pre-clinical and clinical settings.  adeno-associated viral (aav) vectors are gene vectors of choice for the development of gene therapy treatments for many rare diseases affecting various tissues including retina, central nervous system, liver, and muscle. ||| ",yes
Are ACTA1 (alpha actin) and NEB (nebulin) genes related to nemaline myopathy?,"we have studied a cohort of nemaline myopathy (nm) patients with mutations in the muscle alpha-skeletal actin gene (acta1).  many mutations in the skeletal muscle α-actin gene (acta1) lead to muscle weakness and nemaline myopathy.  nemaline myopathy is the most common congenital myopathy and is caused by mutations in various genes such as acta1 (encoding skeletal α-actin).  we propose that altered serum-response factor signalling could be a major factor in actin-based nemaline myopathy, and that this area could be exploited to develop therapies for sufferers.  nemaline myopathy (nm), the most common non-dystrophic congenital disease of skeletal muscle, can be caused by mutations in the skeletal muscle α-actin gene (acta1) (~25% of all nm cases and up to 50% of severe forms of nm).  nemaline myopathy is a neuromuscular disorder, characterized by muscle weakness and hypotonia and is, in 20% of the cases, caused by mutations in the gene encoding alpha-skeletal muscle actin, acta1.  nemaline myopathy (nem) is a neuromuscular disorder characterized by the presence, in skeletal muscle, of nemaline rods composed at least in part of alpha-actinin.  about 20 % of nemaline myopathies are thus far related to skeletal muscle alpha-actin.  nemaline myopathy (nm) is the most common congenital myopathy and is caused by mutations in various genes including neb (nebulin), tpm2 (beta-tropomyosin), tpm3 (gamma-tropomyosin), and acta1 (skeletal alpha-actin).  acta1 mutations are responsible of several muscle disorders including nemaline, cores, actin aggregate myopathies and fiber-type disproportion.  nemaline myopathy is a muscular wasting disease similar to muscular dystrophy, but distinguished by deposits of actin and actin-associated proteins near the z-line of the sarcomere.  nemaline myopathy with intranuclear rods is a rare variant of nemaline myopathy, due in almost all instances to mutation of acta1, the gene encoding skeletal muscle alpha-actin.  nemaline myopathy is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous muscle disorder.  we demonstrate that nebulin can appear abnormal secondary to a primary defect in actin, and show by isoelectric focusing that mutant actin isoforms are present within insoluble actin filaments isolated from muscle from two acta1 nm patients.  to unravel the potential mechanisms involved, we dissected lower limb and diaphragm muscles from a knock-in mouse model of severe nemaline myopathy expressing the acta1 his40tyr actin mutation found in human patients.  we conducted the same biochemical experiments for twelve new actin mutants associated with nemaline myopathy.  mutations in acta1 are a frequent cause of nm (ie, nem3).  our results confirm that nm associated alpha-actin mutations induce a range of defects at the biochemical level as well as in cultured fibroblasts and muscle cells.  nemaline myopathy (nm) is one of the most common congenital nondystrophic myopathies and is characterized by muscle weakness, often from birth.  therefore, in the present study, we aimed at unraveling these mechanisms using muscles from a transgenic mouse model of nemaline myopathy expressing the acta1 asp286gly mutation. ||| ",yes
Are Alu elements transcribed?,"alu elements are primate-specific repeats and represent the most abundant type of transposable elements (te) in the human genome.  we report enzymatic studies of the secondary structure of alu rnas transcribed in vitro from two recently retroposed alu elements.  since alu elements are common in protein-coding genes, they are frequently transcribed into pre-mrnas.  alu elements can be transcribed in two different ways, by two independent polymerases.  alu are mobile noncoding short interspersed elements (sines) present at a million copies in the human genome.  alu elements are short interspersed elements (sines) approximately 300 nucleotides in length.  apart from free alu rnas, alus are also transcribed and retrotranscribed as part of cellular gene transcripts, generally embedded inside 3' untranslated regions (utrs).  alu elements are the most active and predominant type of short interspersed elements (sines) in the human genome.  alu elements are a family of sine retrotransposons in primates.  however, recent findings that these mobile elements are transcribed, both as distinct rna polymerase iii transcripts and as a part of rna polymerase ii transcripts, suggest biological functions and refute the notion that alus are biologically unimportant.  alu elements are the most abundant repetitive elements in the human genome; they have amplified by retrotransposition to reach the present number of more than one million copies.  human alu sequences are short interspersed dna elements which have been greatly amplified by retrotransposition.  alu elements are the most abundant repetitive elements in the human genome; they emerged from the signal recognition particle rna gene and are composed of two related but distinct monomers (left and right arms).  by reintegration of reverse-transcribed rna, suggests that alu rna plays an important role in this process.  despite their being genetically functionless, recent findings suggest that alu elements may have a broad evolutionary impact by affecting gene structures, protein sequences, splicing motifs and expression patterns.  alu rnas transcribed from these elements are present at low levels at normal cell growth but various stress conditions increase their abundance.  this could indicate a physiological function for alu transcripts.  alu retrotransposition is presumably mediated by full-length alu transcripts synthesized by rna polymerase iii, while some polymerase iii-synthesized alu transcripts undergo 3'-processing and accumulate as small cytoplasmic (sc) rnas of unknown function.  in recent years a number of different functional roles for alu sequences have been described.  full-length alu elements are composed of two tandem sequence monomers, the left and right alu arms, both derived from the 7sl signal recognition particle rna. ||| ",yes
Are BBS mutations involved in syndromic Hirschsprung disease?,"the pathogenesis of hirschsprung disease is complex.  of these, eight amino acid changing rare variants and two frameshift variants caused or possibly caused hirschsprung disease.  hirschsprung disease with major and modifying sequence variants in a variety of genes might well serve as a model for the many complex disorders for which the search for genes involved has only just been initiated.  as expected, variants in or near ret showed the strongest overall association with hirschsprung disease and the most statistically significant association was observed when using a recessive genetic model (rs2435357, nc_000010.10:g.43582056t > c; genotype tt, or = 17.31, p = 1.462 × 10-21).  to test whether mutations in the ednrb gene could account for hirschsprung in patients from non-inbred populations, we analysed dna samples from 17 probands of italian origin with hscr.  recently mutations in the gene zfhx1b (sip1) were shown in patients with ""syndromic hirschsprung disease"" with mental retardation (mr) and multiple congenital anomalies (mca), but it was unclear if hirschsprung disease is an obligate symptom of these mutations and if the distinct facial phenotype delineated by mowat et al.  although the ret proto-oncogene is the most frequently affected gene in hirschsprung disease, rare coding sequence variants explain only a small part of hirschsprung disease cases.  hirschsprung's disease (hscr), a congenital complex disorder of intestinal innervation, is often associated with other inherited syndromes.  direct sequencing demonstrated truncating zfhx1b mutations in all four patients with the characteristic facial phenotype, but not in the patient with syndromic hirschsprung disease without the distinct facial appearance.  we aimed to assess the genetic background of hirschsprung disease using a genome-wide association analysis combined with sequencing all ret exons in samples from 105 hirschsprung disease cases (30 familial and 75 sporadic) and 386 controls.  hirschsprung disease is a congenital disorder clinically characterized by the absence of colonic ganglia and genetically by extensive heterogeneity.  hirschsprung disease (hscr, aganglionic megacolon) is a frequent congenital malformation regarded as a multigenic neurocristopathy.  hirschsprung disease (hscr), the most common hereditary cause of intestinal obstruction, shows considerable variation and complex inheritance.  hirschsprung's disease (hscr) is a common congenital malformation of the enteric nervous system.  hirschsprung disease is associated with several other anomalies and syndromes, and animal models for these conditions exist.  hirschsprung disease (hscr) is a complex congenital disorder characterized by intestinal obstructions caused by the absence of the intestinal ganglion cells of the nerve plexuses in variable lengths of the digestive tract.  hirschsprung disease (hscr) is a common genetic disorder presenting with functional intestinal obstruction secondary to enteric aganglionosis.  in order to address these open questions we analyzed the zfhx1b gene in five patients, three of whom had ""syndromic hirschsprung disease"" two with and one without the facial phenotype described by mowat et al.  hirschsprung disease (hscr; omim 142623) is a developmental disorder characterized by aganglionosis along variable lengths of the distal gastrointestinal tract, which results in intestinal obstruction.  hirschsprung disease (hscr) is a congenital disorder characterized by an absence of ganglion cells in the nerve plexuses of the lower digestive tract. ||| ",yes
Are BRAF mutations common in melanoma?,"braf mutations are a common finding in malignant melanoma (mm).  mutation of braf is a prevalent event in melanoma.  objective recent advancements in molecular biology have identified the braf mutation as a common mutation in melanoma.  braf is the most common mutation in melanoma.  braf mutations are typical for malignant melanoma, but occur less frequently in other tumors, including in 1-2% cases of non-small cell lung cancer (nsclc) .  bachground: activating braf mutations are present in approximately 50% of melanomas.  braf mutation was present in 15 of 23 (61%) patients with primary melanoma and in 7 of 12 (58%) patients with metastatic melanoma.  initially, the authors aimed to investigate whether clinicopathological features of melanoma are associated with braf mutations.  braf mutations are present in 40% of human skin melanomas.  tumor biopsy specimens from patients with melanoma were analyzed to determine whether the frequency of braf mutation in metastatic melanoma differed from primary melanoma.  mutation of braf has been proposed to contribute to melanoma development.  braf mutations were identified in 46.7% of primary melanomas and 48.7% of metastases and nras mutations in 20% and 25.6%, respectively.  we evaluated potential associations between braf mutations and histopathologic and pigmentary characteristics of melanoma.  we suggest that braf mutations contribute to benign melanocytic hyperplasia, but are likely to contribute to invasive melanoma only in conjunction with other mutations.  braf mutation frequency in metastatic lesions was 57% and significantly (p = 0.0024) higher than primary melanomas.  the braf(v600e) mutation was found in 63.0% of melanomas, 65.2% of associated nevi and 50.0% of control nevi.  braf mutations were identified in 29% of invasive melanomas and in only 5.6% of in-situ melanomas.  these results suggest that braf mutation in melanoma is most likely to occur prior to the development of metastatic disease.  braf-m% is heterogeneous and frequently increased in braf-mutant melanomas.  we assessed braf mutation frequency in exons 11 and 15 in primary (n = 59) and metastatic (n = 68) melanomas. ||| ",yes
Are CD44 variants (CD44v) associated with poor prognosis of metastasis?,"expression of variant isoforms of cd44 is associated with tumor growth and metastasis.  cd44v3-expression correlated significantly with histologic grade and lymph node metastasis.  the expression of specific cd44 splice variants in malignant tumors has been shown to be associated with metastasis and poor prognosis.  the expression of variant isoforms of cd44 (cd44v) correlates with the metastatic potential of various carcinomas.  it has been shown that cd44 may be associated with poor prognosis in various human malignancies.  objective: cancer stem cell marker cd44 and its variant isoforms (cd44v) may be correlated with tumor growth, metastasis, and chemo-radiotherapy resistance.  cd44 variant isoforms (cd44v) have been shown to be important factors in adverse prognosis in hematological malignancies.  expression of alternatively spliced cd44 isoforms has been reported to correlate with poor prognosis in human squamous cell cancers, i.e.  cd44 is a cell surface receptor implicated in cancer progression and metastases.  loss of cd44s expression in prostate adenocarcinoma predicts a poor prognosis, independent of stage and grade.  the serum level of cd44v6 molecule was higher in patients with lymph node metastasis than other patients (p = 0.05) implying the role of this molecule in tumor progression.  splicing variants of cd44 (cd44v) are increasingly recognised as metastasis-promoting factors in rodent and some human cancers.  results of this study showed that cd44v6 expression level either in the soluble form or in the cell membrane is associated with tumor metastasis indicating the importance of this molecule in progression of colorectal carcinoma.  patients suffering from tumours expressing cd44v6 had a poorer relapse-free (log-rank test, p = 0.02) and overall survival (log-rank test, p = 0.03).  aberrant expression of the cell adhesion molecule cd44 has been detected in human tumours and has been shown to be associated with metastasis and poor prognosis in human malignancies.  cd44 variants showed decreased immunostaining in the tumor cells when compared to normal epithelium.  the expression of specific cell-adhesion molecule cd44 isoforms (splice variants) is associated with metastatic spread and poor prognosis in human malignancies.  therefore, the presence or absence of cd44v expression may be related to high or low metastatic potential of human malignancies.  in different human tumors, splice variants of the surface glycoprotein cd44 (cd44v) are correlated with advanced stages of tumor growth and metastatic potential.  this study was designed to investigate and compare the prognostic relevance and clinical value of soluble forms of cd44 and its variant v6 (cd44v6) and their tissue expression in colorectal carcinoma. ||| ",yes
Are CTCF and BORIS involved in genome regulation and cancer?,"boris (ctcfl) is a dna binding protein which is involved in tumorigenesis.  boris, a paralogue of the transcription factor ctcf, is a member of the cancer-testis antigen (ct) family.  these findings provide further evidence that ctcf behaves as a tumor suppressor, and show boris has a similar growth inhibitory effect in vitro and in vivo.  here, we have deciphered the role of boris on tgfβ1 pathway which is highly affected by embryonic ctcfl expression.  the chromatin regulator ctcf, its cofactor chd8, and antagonistic paralogue boris have wide-ranging effects on gene regulation.  boris and ctcf are paralogous, multivalent 11-zinc finger transcription factors that play important roles in organizing higher-order chromatin architecture.  these results identify a previously unrecognized role of boris-to promote regulatory chromatin interactions that support specific cancer phenotypes.  in tumorigenesis, the role of boris in the expression induction of some ct genes and oncogenes, as well as increasing proliferation/viability of cancer cells has been demonstrated in many researches.  boris, or ctcfl, the so called brother of the regulator of imprinted sites because of the extensive homology in the central dna binding region of the protein to the related regulator, ctcf, is expressed in early gametogenesis and in multiple cancers but not in differentiated somatic cells.  boris/ctcfl, a paralog of ctcf and member of the cancer-testicular antigen family, is abnormally activated in multiple cancers.  both ctcf and boris can bind to the same promoter sequence and recruit diverse proteins.  boris is a paralog of a highly conserved, multi-functional chromatin factor ctcf.  unlike ctcf, which has been shown to possess tumor-suppressive properties, boris belongs to the ""cancer/testis antigen"" family normally expressed only in germ cells and aberrantly activated in a variety of tumors.  in this study, we characterized the entire promoter region of boris/ctcfl, including the cpg islands, to assess the relationship between boris expression and lung cancer.  boris is involved in the regulation of csc cellular and molecular features such as self-renewal, chemo-resistance, tumorigenicity, sphere-forming ability, and migration capacity.  finally, the role of boris in regulating two important signaling pathways including wnt/β-catenin and notch in cscs, and its ability in recruiting transcription factors or chromatin-remodeling proteins to induce tumorigenesis is discussed.  ctcf-like, or boris, is thought to antagonise ctcf and has been found in normal testis, ovary and a large variety of tumour cells.  the cancer-testis antigen ctcfl/boris (brother of regulator of imprinted sites) also known, as a paralog of ctcf -the ""master weaver of the genome"" is a key transcriptional regulator.  by contrast, the germ-cell-specific paralogue of ctcf, boris (brother of the regulator of imprinted sites, also known as ctcfl)6, is overexpressed in several cancers7-9, but its contributions to the malignant phenotype remain unclear.  expression of the cancer-germline (cg) (or cancer-testis) antigen gene boris/ctcfl has been proposed to mediate activation of cg antigen genes in cancer. ||| ",yes
Are Conserved Nonexonic Elements (CNEEs) important in phylogenomics research?,"highly conserved noncoding elements (cnes) constitute a significant proportion of the genomes of multicellular eukaryotes.  here we analyze and study the evolutionary properties of a new type of noncoding marker, conserved nonexonic elements (cnees), which consists of noncoding elements that are estimated to evolve slower than the neutral rate across a set of species.  conserved noncoding elements (cnes) are elements exhibiting extreme noncoding conservation in metazoan genomes.  conserved noncoding elements (cnes) have a significant regulatory influence on their neighboring genes.  conserved noncoding elements (cnes) constitute the majority of sequences under purifying selection in the human genome, yet their function remains largely unknown.  conserved noncoding elements (cncs) are an abundant feature of vertebrate genomes.  although conserved noncoding elements (cnes) constitute the majority of sequences under purifying selection in the human genome, they remain poorly understood.  overall, cnees appear to be promising as phylogenomic markers, yielding phylogenetic resolution as high as for uces and introns but with fewer gaps, less ambiguity in alignments and with patterns of nucleotide substitution more consistent with the assumptions of commonly used methods of phylogenetic analysis.  the distribution of these conserved non-coding elements (cne) within and across genomes has suggested that many of them may have roles as transcriptional regulatory elements.  these elements, collectively referred to as conserved non-coding elements (cnes), are non-randomly distributed across chromosomes and tend to cluster in the vicinity of genes with regulatory roles in multicellular development and differentiation.  scarce work has been done in the analysis of the composition of conserved non-coding elements (cnes) that are identified by comparisons of two or more genomes and are found to exist in all metazoan genomes.  cnes display sequence properties that set them apart from other sequences under constraint, and have recently been proposed as useful markers for the reconstruction of the evolutionary history of organisms.  using a data set of 16 birds plus an alligator outgroup, and ∼3600-∼3800 loci per marker type, we found that although cnees were less variable than bioinformatically derived uces or introns and in some cases exhibited a slower approach to branch resolution as determined by phylogenomic subsampling, the quality of cnee alignments was superior to those of the other markers, with fewer gaps and missing species.  conserved, ultraconserved and other classes of constrained elements (collectively referred as cnes here), identified by comparative genomics in a wide variety of genomes, are non-randomly distributed across chromosomes.  conserved non-coding sequences (cnss) of eukaryotes are known to be significantly enriched in regulatory sequences.  however, since the identification of conserved elements (ces) has been restricted to a limited number of model organisms, the dynamics and evolutionary character of the genomic landscape of conserved, and hence likely functional, sequence is poorly understood in most species.  conserved non-coding sequences (cns) are islands of non-coding sequence that, like protein coding exons, show less divergence in sequence between related species than functionless dna.  to gain new insights into the extreme selection of highly conserved noncoding elements (hcnes), we used a systematic analysis of multi-omic data to study the epigenetic regulation of such elements during the development of drosophila melanogaster.  here, we search for cnes among the ancestral repeat classes in the human genome and report the discovery of a large cne family containing >900 members.  the approach taken here based on the use of a progressive cactus whole-genome alignment to identify ces should be readily applicable to nonmodel organisms in general and help to reveal the rich repertoire of putatively functional noncoding sequence as targets for selection. ||| ",yes
Are CpG islands located close to housekeeping genes?,"it has been envisaged that cpg islands are often observed near the transcriptional start sites (tss) of housekeeping genes.  all housekeeping, but also a substantial minority of tissue-specific genes are associated with the cpg islands.  cpg islands are gc-rich regions located in the promoter regions of housekeeping genes and many tissue-specific genes.  in housekeeping and many tissue-specific genes, the promoter is embedded in a so-called cpg island.  cpg islands are stretches of dna sequence that are enriched in the (cpg)n repeat and are present in close association with all housekeeping genes as well as some tissue-specific genes in the mammalian genome.  cpg islands are important in the protection of adjacent housekeeping genes from de novo dna methylation and for keeping them in a transcriptionally active state.  limited experimental evidence suggests that cpg islands are associated with promoters or replication origins active during early development.  cpg islands (cgis) are cg-rich stretches in the genome that are concentrated near the transcription start sites (tss) of genes.  by reviewing previous cpg-related studies, we consider that the transcription regulation of about half of the human genes, mostly housekeeping (hk) genes, involves cpg islands (cgis), their methylation states, cpg spacing and other chromosomal parameters.  : cpg dinucleotide clusters also referred to as cpg islands (cgis) are usually located in the promoter regions of genes in a deoxyribonucleic acid (dna) sequence.  cpg islands (cgis) are compositionally defined short genomic stretches, which have been studied in the human, mouse, chicken and later in several other genomes.  cpg islands (cgis) are cpg-rich regions compared to cpg-depleted bulk dna of mammalian genomes and are generally regarded as the epigenetic regulatory regions in association with unmethylation, promoter activity and histone modifications.  these results provide strong support for previous speculations that early embryonic expression is associated with cpg islands.  although the promoters of these genes are known to contain cpg islands, the specific dna sequences that are associated with high rnap binding to housekeeping promoters has not been described.  regions with abundant gc nucleotides, a high cpg number, and a length greater than 200 bp in a genome are often referred to as cpg islands.  our results are consistent with previous finding of cpg islands in proximity to active but not inactive proviruses and support further investigation of the protection of the gene transfer vectors from dna methylation.  the frequency of these six dna motifs can predict housekeeping promoters as accurately as the presence of a cpg island, suggesting that they are the structural elements critical for cpg island function.  clusters of cpg at the alpha 1 and alpha 2 genes resemble the 'hpaii tiny fragment (htf) islands' that are characteristic of mammalian 'housekeeping' genes: cpg frequency is not suppressed; testable cpgs are not methylated in dna from erythroid or nonerythroid tissues, although flanking cpgs are methylated; cpg clusters are approximately 1.5 kb long and extend both upstream and downstream of the alpha-globin transcription start site.  cpg islands, which are clusters of cpg dinucleotides in gc-rich regions, are considered gene markers and represent an important feature of mammalian genomes.  interestingly, accumulation of cpg islands at tss appears to be a vertebrate specific genomic feature, which implicates a link between cpg islands and evolution. ||| ",yes
Are DNA helicases involved in progeroid syndromes?,"werner syndrome (ws) is a human segmental progeria resulting from mutations in a dna helicase.  here we review the role of transcription in progeroid syndromes and discuss the implications of similar transcription aberrations in normal and premature aging.  their prominent roles in chromosomal stability are demonstrated by the linkage of mutations in helicase genes to hereditary disorders with defects in dna repair, the replication stress response, and/or transcriptional activation.  human progeroid syndromes are caused by mutations in single genes accelerating some but not all features of normal aging.  progeroid syndromes are genetic disorders that recapitulate some phenotypes of physiological ageing.  werner syndrome (ws), caused by mutations at the wrn helicase gene, is a progeroid syndrome characterized by multiple features consistent with accelerated aging.  werner syndrome (ws) is a human progeroid disorder characterized by genomic instability.  impaired dna damage repair, especially deficient transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair, leads to segmental progeroid syndromes in human patients as well as in rodent models.  dna helicases have risen to the forefront as genome caretakers.  most progeroid disorders are linked to defects in genome maintenance, and while it remains unknown if similar processes underlie normal and premature aging, they provide useful models for the study of aging.  classical progerias, such as hutchinson-gilford progeria syndrome (hgps), are generally caused by mutations in lmna leading to accumulation of the toxic protein progerin and consequently, to nuclear envelope alterations.  we discuss the roles of recq dna helicases in cancer, emphasizing some of the more recent developments in sl.  mutations in the werner gene promote the segmental progeroid werner syndrome (ws) with increased genomic instability and cancer.  altered transcription is speculated to play a causative role in aging, and is involved in the pathology of most if not all progeroid syndromes.  the gene mutated in werner syndrome encodes both a 3' --> 5' dna helicase and a 3' --> 5' dna exonuclease.  among the rt abnormalities, we identified the tumor protein p63 gene (tp63) as a gene marker for progeroid syndromes.  the gene defective in ws encodes a 3' --> 5' dna helicase (gray, m. d., shen, j.-c., kamath-loeb, a. s., blank, a. , sopher, b. l., martin, g. m., oshima, j., and loeb, l.  our results identified a progeroid-specific rt signature that is common to cells from three hgps and three rts patients and distinguishes them from healthy individuals across a wide range of ages.  possible mechanisms by which helicases might produce the variable phenotypes are discussed.  progeroid phenotypes are mainly encountered in 2 types of syndromes: in laminopathies, which are characterized by nuclear shape abnormalities due to lamin a alteration, and in dna damage response defect syndromes. ||| ",yes
Are DNA methylation maps applicable to the diagnosis of non-small-cell lung carcinomas?,"dna methylation was suggested as the promising biomarker for lung cancer diagnosis.  we previously identified a number of genes which were methylated significantly more frequently in the tumor compared to the non-cancerous lung tissues from non-small cell lung cancer (nsclc) patients.  aberrant dna methylation is a frequent phenomenon in non-small cell lung cancers.  we evaluated the methylation status of cdkn2a, rarβ, and rassf1a promoter regions in non-small cell lung carcinomas (nsclcs) by using pyrosequencing.  in this study, we developed a panel of dna methylation biomarkers and validated their diagnostic efficiency for non-small cell lung cancer (nsclc) in a large chinese han nsclc retrospective cohort.  our results provide compelling evidence that different histological types of lung cancer may be distinguished from normal tissue based on methylation profiles of specific genes.  gene methylation has been frequently observed in lung cancer.  we determined the dna methylation status of 27 genes using quantitative methylight assays in lung tumor samples from 117 clinically well-characterized nsclc patients.  the purpose of this study was to analyze whether the detection of genes with aberrant promoter methylation can be useful noninvasive biomarkers in bronchial aspirates from lung cancer.  we compared dna methylation profiles of 28 adenocarcinomas of the lungs of never-smokers with paired adjacent nonmalignant lung tissue.  conclusions: we discovered several novel methylation driver genes of diagnostic and therapeutic relevance in lung cancer.  the purpose of this study was to determine the abnormal methylation genes and pathways involved in nonsmoking lung adenocarcinoma patients.  we have used a microarray approach to assess the methylation status of 245 cpg positions in 59 candidate genes in 26 squamous cell carcinomas, and 22 adenocarcinomas as well as 26 normal adjacent lung tissue samples from smokers to identify genes that show a distinct methylation status difference between the two different tumour type tissues and normal adjacent tissue.  these results suggest that the methylation profiles of lung adenocarcinomas of never-smokers and adjacent nonmalignant lung tissue are significantly different.  we investigated bronchial aspirates of patients admitted for suspected lung cancer with regard to the prevalence of aberrant methylation of potential marker genes.  methods: genome-wide dna methylation profiles were surveyed in 18 pairs of tumors and adjacent normal tissues from non-small cell lung cancer (nsclc) patients using reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (rrbs).  applying quantitative methylation specific pcr (qmsp) we analyzed bronchial aspirates from 75 patients with primary lung cancer and 64 bronchial aspirates of patients diagnosed with benign lung disease for promoter methylation of 3 candidate marker genes (p16(ink4a), rarb2 and sema3b).  methylation quantification using ms-qpcr and pyrosequencing of cytological lymph node samples obtained using echobronchoscopy is feasible if an appropriate dna concentration is obtained, notably contributing to the identification of epigenetic biomarkers capable of improving decision-making for the benefit of potentially curable lung cancer patients.  epigenetic changes in lung cancer potentially represent important diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic targets.  the role of dna methylation in the pathogenesis of cancer is gradually being recognized. ||| ",yes
Are Drosophila ultraconserved elements candidate ncRNAs?,"we have explored the role of lineage restricted targets, using drosophila, in order to better understand the evolutionary significance of microrna-target relationships.  how many intergenically encoded non-coding rnas (ncrnas) are expressed during various developmental stages in drosophila?  in a recent study that identified highly evolutionary conserved sequences in three genomes of diptera species we described an ultraconserved element found at an internal exon-intron junction of the drosophila melanogaster homothorax (hth) gene that appeared to be involved in the control of hth pre-mrna splicing.  during a large-scale effort to identify small noncoding rnas in drosophila, we isolated a u5 snrna-like molecule containing a 5' segment identical to that of the canonical (major) u5 snrna but with a variant sm binding site and a distinct 3' hairpin sequence.  as with vertebrates, ultraconserved sequences in insects appear to occur primarily in intergenic and intronic sequences, and at intron-exon junctions.  drosophila possesses the core gene silencing machinery but, like all insects, lacks the canonical rna-dependent rna polymerases (rdrps) that in c. elegans either trigger or enhance two major small rna-dependent gene silencing pathways.  our results reveal striking degrees of conservation between each drosophila rna and its vertebrate cognate, and also demonstrate blocks of homology among the drosophila small nuclear rnas, as previously described for vertebrates.  this study has taken advantage of the availability of the assembled genomic sequence of flies, mosquitos, ants and bees to explore the presence of ultraconserved sequence elements in these phylogenetic groups.  we have investigated the sequences of the major small nuclear rnas of drosophila cultured cells, with the objective of elucidating phylogenetically conserved primary and secondary structures by comparison of the data with previously determined sequences of these rnas in vertebrate species.  analysis of ucsbs in these dipterans and hymenoptera will lead to a greater understanding of their evolutionary origin and function of their conserved non-coding sequences and aid in discovery of core elements of enhancers.this study applies the phylogenetic footprinting program evoprinter to detection of ultraconserved non-coding sequence elements in diptera, including flies and mosquitos, and hymenoptera, including ants and bees.  ultraconserved sequences flanking known developmental genes were detected in ceratitis and musca when compared with drosophila species, in aedes and culex when compared with anopheles, and between ants and bees.  we compared non-coding sequences found within and flanking drosophila developmental genes to homologous sequences in ceratitis capitata and musca domestica many of the conserved sequence blocks (csbs) that constitute drosophila cis-regulatory dna, recognized by evoprinter alignment protocols, are also conserved in ceratitis and musca also conserved is the position but not necessarily the orientation of many of these ultraconserved csbs (ucsbs) with respect to flanking genes.  the early developmental stage appears to be associated with more abundant ncrnas than later developmental stages.  developmentally regulated genes in drosophila, which are conserved through evolution, are potential candidates for key functions in biological processes such as cell cycle, programmed cell death, and cancer.  contrary to the classical view, a large amount of non-coding dna seems to be selectively constrained in drosophila and other species.  recently, we identified a large number of ultraconserved (uc) sequences in noncoding regions of human, mouse, and rat genomes that appear to be essential for vertebrate and amniote ontogeny.  here, we used similar methods to identify ultraconserved genomic regions between the insect species drosophila melanogaster and drosophila pseudoobscura, as well as the more distantly related anopheles gambiae.  based on this finding, another six similar u5 snrna-like sequences were identified within the drosophila genome by sequence similarity to the invariant loop in the 5' half of u5.  recently, by searching the drosophila genome database, we also found dre-like sequences in the 5'-flanking regions of many genes with other functions.  genomic and cdna clones representing a homolog of the drosophila dnc+ gene were isolated from rat libraries and characterized. ||| ",yes
Are EDNRB mutations involved in the development of Hirschsprung disease?,"the endothelin-b receptor gene (ednrb) and the endothelin-3 gene (edn3) have recently been recognized as susceptibility genes for hirschsprung's disease (hd).  to investigate the mutations of etb in hirschsprung disease, expression of the etb gene in lymphoblastoid cells from patients and normal healthy adults was examined, and novel mutant transcripts were found.  hirschsprung disease is a heterogeneous genetic disorder, causative genes of which include the endothelin b receptor (etb).  the pathogenesis of hirschsprung disease is complex.  the preferential production of this null function etb by rna editing/splicing could be involved in the etiology of some cases of hirschsprung disease.  hirschsprung disease with major and modifying sequence variants in a variety of genes might well serve as a model for the many complex disorders for which the search for genes involved has only just been initiated.  novel ednrb mutations have been detected in non-syndromic hd patients with heterozygous forms, and homozygous mutations of the ednrb or the edn3 genes have been reported in hd patients associated with type 2 waardenburg syndrome.  we aimed to assess the genetic background of hirschsprung disease using a genome-wide association analysis combined with sequencing all ret exons in samples from 105 hirschsprung disease cases (30 familial and 75 sporadic) and 386 controls.  the whole findings seem to suggest that low-penetrance mutations would be necessary but not sufficient and the additional presence of the ""hirschsprung disease haplotype"" could contribute to the manifestation of the disease.  traditional ret germline mutations account for a small subset of hirschsprung disease patients, but several studies have shown that there is a specific haplotype of ret associated with the sporadic forms of hirschsprung disease.  ret gene is the major gene causing hirschsprung's disease (hd).  of these, eight amino acid changing rare variants and two frameshift variants caused or possibly caused hirschsprung disease.  although the ret proto-oncogene is the most frequently affected gene in hirschsprung disease, rare coding sequence variants explain only a small part of hirschsprung disease cases.  mutations in the ret gene are the primary cause of hirschsprung disease (hscr), or congenital intestinal aganglionosis.  as expected, variants in or near ret showed the strongest overall association with hirschsprung disease and the most statistically significant association was observed when using a recessive genetic model (rs2435357, nc_000010.10:g.43582056t > c; genotype tt, or = 17.31, p = 1.462 × 10-21).  hirschsprung disease (hscr) is a congenital developmental defect of the enteric nervous system known to be associated with the ret-protooncogene and other candidates.  two patients with mutations in genes of the ednrb pathway also harbored a mutation in ret.  the ret proto-oncogene is considered to be the major susceptibility gene involved in hirschsprung disease.  background: hirschsprung's disease (hscr) is a heterogeneous congenital malformation of the enteric nervous system with a complex genetic etiology.  a significant over-transmission of the ""hirschsprung disease haplotype"" was detected when comparing transmitted versus nontransmitted alleles in the group of hirschsprung disease triads without mutation. ||| ",yes
Are Notch mutations related to T-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (T-ALL)?,"notch1 mutations are found in more than 50% of human t cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (t-all) cells.  activating mutations in notch1, an essential regulator of t cell development, are frequently found in human t cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (t-all).  t-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (t-all), unlike other all types, is only infrequently associated with chromosomal aberrations, but it was recently shown that most individuals with t-all carry activating mutations in the notch1 gene.  the notch signaling pathway is crucial in t-cell development, notch1 mutations are frequently present in t-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (t-all).  activating notch1-mutations, leading to aberrant downstream signaling, have been identified in human t-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (t-all).  the notch pathway is highly active in almost all patients with t-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (t-all), but the implication of notch ligands in t-all remains underexplored.  the notch pathway is frequently activated in t-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias (t-alls).  notch signaling is of crucial importance in normal t-cell development and notch 1 is frequently mutated in t-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias (t-all), leading to aberrantly high notch signaling.  oncogenic notch1 mutations are found in most t-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemias in humans and t-cell lymphomas in mice.  in t-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (t-all) notch 1 receptors are frequently mutated.  t-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (t-all) patients frequently display notch1 activating mutations and notch can transcriptionally down-regulate the tumor suppressor pten.  notch pathway activation by mutations in either notch1 and/or fbxw7 is one of the most common molecular events in t-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (t-all) and, in pediatric disease, predicts for favorable outcome.  the notch3 receptor is frequently expressed in t-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (t-all).  aberrant notch signaling represents an important oncogenic mechanism for t cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (t-all), an aggressive subset of the most common malignant childhood cancer all.  higher expression of notch1 was associated with notch1 mutation, more novel mutation of this gene might be identified in different populations and its contribution to the molecular pathogenesis of t-all is needed further research.  t-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (t-all) is an aggressive blood cancer caused by the deregulation of key t-cell developmental pathways, including notch signaling.  activating lesions frequently affect notch1 in t-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (t-all) and, recently, have been found in non-small-cell lung cancer (nsclc) as well.  notch signaling, which is driven by the notch1 receptor, plays an essential role in the pathogenesis and stroma-mediated drug resistance of t-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (t-all).  notch signaling is often considered a model hematopoietic proto-oncogene because of its role as the main trigger of t cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (t-all).  aberrant notch signaling in t-all occurs by notch1 gain-of-function mutations and by notch3 overexpression. ||| ",yes
Are OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 associated with bilirubin transport?,"to assess the contribution of oatp-c to the hepatobiliary transport of bilirubin, a pharmacogenomic evaluation with regard to polymorphisms of three candidate genes, oatp-c, mrp2, and ugt1a1, was performed.  expression of the oatp1b proteins was decreased in advanced liver diseases and inversely correlated with serum bilirubin levels.  organic anion-transporting polypeptides oatp1b1 and oatp1b3 are sinusoidal membrane transporters mediating liver uptake of a wide range of substrates including conjugated and unconjugated bilirubin, xenobiotics and drugs.  oatp-c, oatp2, lst-1, or slc21a6) is a liver-specific organic anion uptake transporter and has been shown to be a higher affinity bilirubin uptake transporter than oatp1b3.  oatp1b1, oatp1b3 and oatp2b1 are important members of the organic anion transporting polypeptides (oatp) family and are implicated in the hepatic disposition of endobiotics and xenobiotics.  bilirubin elimination is a multifaceted process consisting of uptake of bilirubin into the hepatocytes facilitated by oatp1b1 and oatp1b3.  large clinical studies are needed to confirm a role of oatp-c in the carrier-mediated uptake of bilirubin in the human liver.  since bilirubin and bile acids are the substrates of oatp1b2, the contents of total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, indirect bilirubin, and total bile acids in serum are significantly higher in slco1b2 ko rats than the data of wild-type rats.  in human liver, oatp1b1, 1b3, and 2b1 are located at the basolateral membrane of hepatocytes and are involved in hepatic drug uptake and biliary elimination.  however, because drug transporters also contribute to bilirubin elimination, the purpose of this work was to investigate the in vitro inhibition of oatp1b1, oatp1b3, mrp2, and bsep of select test drugs known to elicit hyperbilirubinemia.  due to limited solubility and poor ionization of bilirubin and its glucuronide, the formation of estradiol 3-glucuronide was used as a surrogate to assess ugt1a1 activity, while the transport of pitavastatin, cdcf, and taurocholate were used as surrogate probe substrates to monitor the function of oatp1b1/oatp1b3, mrp2, and bsep, respectively.  subjects with the oatp-c*15 allele had higher bilirubin levels; unconjugated bilirubin levels in *1b/*1b (n = 3), *1b/*15 (n= 7), and *15/*15 (n = 1) subjects were 0.40 +/- 0.10, 0.77 +/- 0.35, and 0.70 (mg/dl), respectively.  this study indicates that oatp1b2 has a major role in the hepatic uptake of unconjugated bas.  the organic anion transporting polypeptide 1b1 (oatp1b1, encoded by slco1b1) plays an important role in the transport of endogenous and xenobiotic compounds, such as bile acids and rifampin.  organic anion transporting polypeptide 1b1 (oatp1b1) and oatp1b3 are human hepatocyte transporters that mediate the uptake of various endogenous and exogenous substances.  the present study investigated the physiological role of oatp1a4 in ba homeostasis by using oatp1a4-null mice.  the organic anion-transporting polypeptide 1b family (oatp1b2 in rodents and oatp1b1/1b3 in humans) is liver-specific and transports various chemicals into the liver.  our aim was to correlate oatp1b expression with hyperbilirubinemia in common liver diseases.  oatp1a1, 1a4, and 1b2 are the three major oatp1 family members in rodent liver.  our results show that expression of oatp1b1, but not of oatp1b3 and oatp2b1, is significantly affected by genetic variants. ||| ",yes
Are Sidekick proteins members of the immunoglobulin superfamily?,"the immunoglobulin superfamily is a large category of proteins defined by their structural similarity to immunoglobulins.  the small members of the immunoglobulin superfamily (igsf) are a molecularly diverse group of proteins composed solely of immunoglobulin domains.  the immunoglobulin superfamily is a group of proteins, each made of one or several domains sharing key structural features with either the variable (v) or the constant (c) immunoglobulin domains.  the immunoglobulin superfamily (igsf) comprises the immunoglobulins (ig), t cell receptors (tr) and proteins that have the common feature of having at least one ig-like domain.  the sidekick (sdk) gene, first described in drosophila, encodes the single-pass transmembrane protein, sdk, which is one of the largest among igsf membrane proteins.  the immunoglobulin superfamily (igsf) is a heterogenic group of proteins built on a common fold, called the ig fold, which is a sandwich of two beta sheets.  we identify sidekick (sdk)-1 and -2, homologous transmembrane immunoglobulin superfamily molecules that mediate homophilic adhesion in vitro and direct laminar targeting of neurites in vivo.  immunoglobulin superfamily (igsf), an extensive collection of proteins possessing at least one immunoglobulin-like (ig-like) domain, performs a wide range of functions in recognition, binding or adhesion process of cells.  the immunoglobulin superfamily (igsf) is a large group of cell surface proteins that include various immunoregulatory receptors such as novel immune type receptors (nitrs), which are a family of diversified proteins found exclusively in bony fish.  many of the immunoglobulin superfamily (igsf) molecules play pivotal roles in cell communication.  these antigens bind to the fab regions of immunoglobulin molecules outside their complementarity-determining regions.  immunoglobulin superfamily (igsf) proteins are known for their ability to specifically recognize and adhere to other molecules, mediating cell-surface reception and pathogen recognition.  the i-type lectins are a subset of the immunoglobulin superfamily that are capable of carbohydrate-protein interactions.  mammalian igsf proteins such as antibodies are among the best characterized molecules of the immune system; in contrast, the involvement of invertebrate igsf members in immunity has not been broadly studied.  small immunoproteins (sips) are single-chain molecules comprising the variable regions of an antibody assembled in a single polypeptide (scfv) and joined to the immunoglobulin heavy-chain dimerizing domain.  the majority of these proteins are involved in protein-protein binding as receptors, antibodies or cell adhesion molecules.  analysis of the predicted anopheles gambiae transcriptome identified 138 proteins that have at least one immunoglobulin domain.  in silico analysis indicated that soigsf1 is a type i transmembrane glycoprotein and contains an n-terminal signal peptide sequence, a single extracellular immunoglobulin v domain, a transmembrane region, and a cytoplasmic region.  during an ongoing in situ hybridization analysis of expressed sequence tags in zebrafish we identified secreted immunoglobulin domain 4 (sid4), a gene encoding a soluble vertebrate protein composed solely of four immunoglobulin domains.  the msiglec-e cdna encodes a protein of 467 amino acids that contains three extracellular immunoglobulin-like domains, a transmembrane region and a cytoplasmic tail bearing two immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (itims). ||| ",yes
Are TAD boundaries in Drosophila depleted in highly-expressed genes?,"in drosophila, tads are often separated by inter-tad regions containing active housekeeping genes and associated insulator binding proteins.  borders between tads are formed in regions containing active genes and clusters of architectural protein binding sites.  in drosophila melanogaster, many of these hd tfs are expressed in the early embryo and control transcription of target genes in development through their interaction with cis-regulatory modules.  eukaryotic chromosomes are partitioned into topologically associating domains (tads) that are demarcated by distinct insulator-binding proteins (ibps) in drosophila.  we investigated the hypothesis that several transcriptional repressors are necessary to set the boundaries of anterior pair-rule stripes in drosophila.  our results are consistent with tll being a newly-identified component of a combinatorial network of repressor genes that control pair-rule stripe formation in the anterior blastoderm of drosophila.  the synteny blocks corresponding to the extremely late-replicating regions in the d. melanogaster genome consistently display two-fold lower gene density across different drosophila species.  our results highlight differences between transcription of tart and of other drosophila non-ltr elements and they provide a foundation for testing the relationship between exceptional aspects of tart transcription and tart's specialized role at telomeres.  transcription start site (tss) evolution remains largely undescribed in drosophila, likely due to limited annotations in non-melanogaster species.  drosophila chromosomes are organized into distinct domains differing in their predominant chromatin composition, replication timing and evolutionary conservation.  we have investigated the role of tgif, a tale-class homeodomain transcription factor, in drosophila development.  the transcription of most genes is repressed after temperature stress in drosophila.  in this study, we introduce a concise new method that selectively sequences from the 5'-end of mrna and used it to identify tss in four drosophila species, including drosophila melanogaster, d. simulans, d. sechellia, and d. pseudoobscura.  evidence is accumulating that silencing of drosophila homeotic genes is conferred by two types of cis- regulatory sequences: initiation (sil-1) and maintenance (sil-m) elements.  here we present a comprehensive analysis of the epigenetic landscape of heterochromatic genes across all the developmental stages of drosophila using the available histone modification and expression data from modencode.  in contrast, several genes in the pericentromeric regions of drosophila melanogaster are dependent on this heterochromatic environment for their expression.  late-replicating domains (intercalary heterochromatin) in the drosophila genome display a number of features suggesting their organization is quite unique.  this observation is consistent with the existence of extensive domains of repressive chromatin that replicate extremely late and have conserved gene order in the drosophila genome.  tad border strength declines, allowing for an increase in long-distance inter-tad interactions.  as a member of the trithorax-group, the trithorax-like (trl) gene of drosophila melanogaster contributes to the expression of homeotic genes and many other genes. ||| ",no
Are Ultra-conserved elements (UCEs) enriched in segmental duplications?,"we have demonstrated that nonexonic uces are depleted among segmental duplications (sds) and copy number variants (cnvs) and proposed that their ultraconservation may reflect a mechanism of copy counting via comparison.  ultraconserved elements (uces) are stretches of hundreds of nucleotides with highly conserved cores flanked by variable regions.  ultraconserved elements (uces) are stretches of hundreds of nucleotides with highly conserved cores flanked by variable regions.  ultraconserved elements (uces) are sequences that are identical between reference genomes of distantly related species.  ultraconserved elements (uces) are discrete genomic elements conserved across large evolutionary distances.  ultraconserved elements (uces), stretches of dna that are identical between distantly related species, are enigmatic genomic features whose function is not well understood.  ultraconserved elements (uces) have become popular markers in phylogenomic studies because of their cost effectiveness and their potential to resolve problematic phylogenetic relationships.  the ultraconserved elements (uces) are defined as stretches of at least 200 base pairs of human dna that match identically with corresponding regions in the mouse and rat genomes, albeit their real significance remains an intriguing issue.  this study explores the relationship between three-dimensional genome organization and ultraconserved elements (uces), an enigmatic set of dna elements that are perfectly conserved between the reference genomes of distantly related species.  ultraconserved elements (uces) show the peculiar feature to retain extended perfect sequence identity among human, mouse, and rat genomes.  ultraconserved elements (uces) are segments of >200 bp length showing absolute sequence identity between orthologous regions of human, rat and mouse genomes.  interestingly, human uces have been reported to be strongly depleted among segmental duplications and benign copy number variants (cnvs).  genome sequence comparison between evolutionarily distant species revealed ultraconserved elements (uces) among mammals under strong purifying selection.  interestingly, we observed that ultraconserved elements clustered by sequence similarity.  ules are located in intergenic or intronic regions and are depleted from segmental duplications.  our findings indicate that these ultraconserved elements are not the exclusive property of higher modern eukaryotes, but rather transmitted from their metazoan ancestors.  ultraconserved elements are highly enriched with binding sites to developmental transcription factors regardless of how they cluster.  interestingly, these elements exhibit properties similar to mammalian uces, such that we named them uce-like elements (ules).  we identified large numbers of ultraconserved elements across distant species.  most intergenic ultraconserved elements (uce) appear to be tissue-specific enhancers, whereas another class of intragenic uces is involved in regulation of gene expression by means of alternative splicing. ||| ",no
Are adenylyl cyclases always transmembrane proteins?,"catalytic subunits of mammalian adenylyl cyclases have been proposed to contain 12 transmembrane domains, a property shared with some voltage-sensitive ion channels.  for many transmembrane signaling events adenylyl cyclases (acs) are the final effector enzymes which integrate and interpret divergent signals from different pathways.  adenylyl cyclase (ac) generates cyclic amp required for a variety of cellular functions, and its regulation plays a major role in cellular signal transduction in eukaryotes and prokaryotes.  functional and ultrastructural investigations have shown that adenylyl cyclases are intimately associated with sites of calcium ion entry into the cell.  metazoan membrane-bound adenylate cyclases are composed of 12 transmembrane spanning regions, and two cyclase domains which function as a heterodimer and are activated by g-proteins.  sequence alignment demonstrates that the two cyclase domains are transposed, relative to these domains in adenylate cyclases.  transmembrane adenylyl cyclases (adcy) are involved in the regulation of multiple brain processes such as synaptic plasticity, learning and memory.  recombinant technologies have allowed biochemical analysis of adenylyl cyclases in-vitro and the development of transgenic animals as well as knock-out mice have yielded new insights in the physiological role of some ac isoforms.  until now, it was attributed exclusively to the activity of the g-protein-responsive transmembrane adenylyl cyclase.  until recently, transmembrane adenylyl cyclase (tmac) was considered the major source for camp in the cell, and the role of camp signaling was therefore attributed exclusively to the activity of this family of enzymes.  we hypothesize that conformational changes in the catalytic subunit of the enzymes caused by changes in the membrane potential may enhance stimulation of adenylyl cyclases by the guanylyl nucleotide stimulatory protein.  this article is part of a special issue entitled: the role of soluble adenylyl cyclase in health and disease.  in contrast, membrane-bound guanylate cyclases have only one transmembrane spanning region and one cyclase domain, and are activated by extracellular ligands to form a homodimer.  we found mrnas for adenylyl cyclases vi and vii in cho and adenylyl cyclases ix and vii in b82 cells.  adrenergic receptors couple to gs-proteins leading to transmembrane adenylyl cyclase activation and cytosolic cyclic adenosine monophosphate (camp) production.  the activation of the canonical camp/pka pathway depends on transmembrane adenylyl cyclase (tmac).  ca2+-sensitive adenylyl cyclases are key integrators of ca2+ and camp signaling.  the expressed adenylyl cyclase/aequorin chimera was appropriately localized to the plasma membrane, as judged by biochemical fractionation and functional analysis.  to date, ten different mammalian isoforms of adenylyl cyclase (ac) have been cloned and characterized.  in addition to transmembrane ac, mammalian cells possess a second source of camp, the ubiquitously expressed soluble adenylyl cyclase (sac). ||| ",no
Are alterations in ultraconserved elements associated with colorectal adenocarcinoma?,"identification of the colorectal adenoma-carcinoma sequence with its corresponding genetic and epigenetic alterations has significantly increased our knowledge of the etiopathogenesis of colorectal cancer (crc).  the accumulation of genetic alterations of cancer-related genes is also essential for colorectal carcinogenesis.  our aims were to assess the role of epigenetic processes in tumour formation and to identify characteristic dna methylation and mirna alterations in the colorectal adenoma-carcinoma sequence.  identification of molecular alterations occurring in the adenomatous and carcinomatous components within the same tumor would greatly enhance understanding of the neoplastic progression of colorectal cancer.  our data support the presence of colorectal cancer-associated mirna alterations in screen-detected adenomas that may be useful for risk stratification for surveillance interval planning.  colorectal cancer (crc) arises from the normal colon epithelium through the accumulation of genetic mutations and epigenetic alterations that are associated with progression along the histological adenoma-adenocarcinoma sequence.  as most colorectal cancers (crc) develop from villous adenomas, studying alterations in gene expression profiles across the colorectal adenoma-dysplasia-carcinoma sequence may yield potential biomarkers of disease progression.  it is unclear whether somatic copy number alterations (scnas) contribute to the development of colorectal cancer (crc).  in 164 colorectal tumours (34 hyperplastic polyps, 38 tubular adenomas with low grade dysplasia (ta-l), 51 tubular adenomas with high grade dysplasia (ta-h), and 41 invasive carcinomas), epithelial and stromal genetic instability with national cancer institute standard microsatellite markers and chromosome 17 (chr17) markers, were analysed by a combination of laser capture microdissection and genescan approaches.  for two distinct subsets of the microsatellite unstable colorectal cancers, those with acquired methylation and braf mutation, and those without methylation suggestive of an underlying germ line mutation, the molecular changes in the majority of their synchronous benign tumors were different from the colorectal cancer.  the defined lncrna sets may have a regulatory role in the colorectal adenoma-carcinoma transition.  colorectal cancer (crc) is a major cause of cancer morbidity and mortality, and elucidation of its underlying genetics has advanced diagnostic screening, early detection, and treatment.  measurement of dna hypomethylation levels of colorectal adenomas by line-1 could have future implications in approaches to defining crc risk in screening programs.  colorectal cancer and adenoma adjacent to cancer exhibit distinct microrna (mirna) alterations in an apparent mucosa-to-adenocarcinoma sequence.  our results suggest that increased expression of defense genes is an early event in the progression of colorectal adenomas to carcinomas.  here, we aimed to identify the molecular profiles of early colorectal carcinogenesis based on scnas and determine the associations of other molecular abnormalities for the detection of neoplasia in both intramucosal neoplasia (imn) and invasive crc with invasion into the muscular layer without metastasis (early invasive crc).  line-1 hypomethylation of precancerous adenomas correlates with the presence of synchronous crc.  in addition, the incidence of genetic alterations in the colorectal adenomas that we examined appears to be independent of the tumour's dna index.  this upward shift in the frequency of proliferating cells in the crypt was significantly higher in the patients with colorectal adenoma and cancer than in the controls, and may be used to identify subjects at high risk for colorectal cancer.  thus microenvironmental changes due to genetic alteration in chr17 markers in stromal cells may play an important role in colon adenoma and adenocarcinoma development. ||| ",yes
Are alterations in ultraconserved elements implicated in breast cancer?,"limited studies on breast cancer indicated pathogenic changes in the expressions of some repeat elements.  although little is known regarding the mechanisms behind the onset of breast cancer (bc) through reproductive risk factors, new researches have highlighted some early tumor-related methylation footmarks in the breast tissue of apparently clinically healthy women as their potential epigenetic mechanism.  ionizing radiation is a well-recognized risk factor for the development of breast cancer.  the accrued scientific findings strongly suggest epigenetic dysregulation in breast cancer pathogenesis though genomic instability is central to breast cancer hallmarks.  defective dna repair has been suggested as a possible predisposing factor for breast cancer.  this case-control study evaluated blood methylation level of two repetitive elements and selected breast cancer-related genes in relation to breast cancer risk, and the associations with serum level of persistent organic pollutants (pops) and breast cancer risk factors in greenlandic inuit.  here we investigated the impact cancer risk factors have on the normal breast epigenome by analyzing dna methylation genome-wide (infinium 450 k array) in cancer-free women from the susan g. komen tissue bank (n = 100).  breast cancer is a sporadic disease with genetic and epigenetic components.  genomic alterations have been observed in breast carcinomas that affect the capacity of cells to regulate proliferation, signaling, and metastasis.  this narrative review summarizes the current literature on the involvement of fa genes in sporadic and familial breast cancer with a focus on clinical data derived from large cohorts.  positive associations for atm in second tertile (or: 2.33, 95% ci: 1.04; 5.23) and esr2 in third tertile (or: 2.22, 95% ci: 0.97; 5.05) suggest an increased breast cancer risk with high dna methylation.  several studies have found aberrant dna methylation levels in breast cancer cases, but factors influencing dna methylation patterns and the mechanisms are not well understood.  we examined interaction between 27 newly identified breast cancer risk alleles (identified within the nci cancer genetic markers of susceptibility and the breast cancer association consortium genome-wide association studies) and occupational and medical diagnostic radiation exposure among 859 cases and 1083 controls nested within the united states radiologic technologists cohort.  loss of dna repair by brca1 functional deficiency in breast cancer has been proposed as a relevant contribution to breast cancer progression for tumors with no germline mutation.  notably, dna methylation was not strongly associated with the other evaluated breast cancer risk factors.  dna methylation changes with age occur at regulatory regions, and are further exacerbated in cancer, suggesting that age influences breast cancer risk in part through its contribution to epigenetic dysregulation in normal breast tissue.  risk biomarkers are those associated with increased cancer risk and include mammographic abnormalities, proliferative breast disease with or without atypia, family clustering and inherited germ-line abnormalities.  brca1, brca2, akt1, mtor, kras) and survival genes; possibly highlighting their importance in the carcinogenesis of breast.  thus, upregulation of hsa-mir-26b-5p and downregulation of trps1 in radiation-associated breast cancer tissue samples suggests these molecules representing radiation markers in breast cancer.  somatic changes in the genome of breast cancer cells include amplifications, deletions and gene mutations. ||| ",yes
Are chromomethylases present in animal genomes?,"the beta-carbonic anhydrase (ca, ec 4.2.1.1) enzymes have been reported in a variety of organisms, but their existence in animals has been unclear.  here, we sequenced the mitochondrial genomes of cephalonomia gallicola (chrysidoidea: bethylidae) and wallacidia oculata (vespoidea: mutillidae).  animal-type photolyases have very limited sequence homology to microbial-type photolyases.  the c3 and factor b genes, but probably not the other complement genes, are present in the genome of the cnidaria and some protostomes, indicating that the origin of the central part of the complement system was established more than 1,000 mya.  the ability to obtain large amounts of genomic sequence for organisms and high throughput technology has led to a change in the thrust of research at the level of chromosomes in animals.  here, we investigate the distribution and numbers of eccdnas in a condensed and less repeat-rich genome compared with the human genome, using columba livia domestica (domestic rock pigeon) as a model organism.  the novel beta-ca gene, here named dmbca, was identified from flybase, and its orthologs were searched and reconstructed from sequence databases, confirming the presence of beta-ca sequences in 55 metazoan species.  in the hymenoptera, three types of protein-coding gene rearrangement events occur, i.e.  members of most complement gene families are also present in ascidians, although they do not show a one-to-one correspondence to their counterparts in higher vertebrates, indicating that the gene duplications of each gene family occurred independently in vertebrates and ascidians.  the purpose of the present study was to perform extensive sequence analysis to show that the beta-cas are present in invertebrates and to clone and characterize a member of this enzyme family from a representative model organism of the animal kingdom, e.g., drosophila melanogaster.  the recent accumulation of genomic information of many representative animals has made it possible to trace the evolution of the complement system based on the presence or absence of each complement gene in the analyzed genomes.  sequencing projects have revealed the information of many animal genomes and thereby enabled the exploration of genome evolution.  in the last years, chromosome conformation capture experiments (4c-seq, 5c, and hic) in several organisms have shown that the genomes of many bilaterian animals are organized in the 3d chromatin space in compartments called topologically associated domains (tads).  the chromosome complements (karyotypes) of animals display a great diversity in number and morphology.  overall, our results support that eccdnas are common in pigeons, that the amount of unique eccdna types per nucleus can differ between species as well as subspecies, and suggest that eccdnas from repeats are found in proportions relative to the content of repetitive elements in a genome.  against this background, the genomes of all species are remarkably conserved, not only in transcribed sequences, but also in some chromosome-specific non-coding sequences and in gene order.  in particular, the chromophore/cofactor composition of animal photolyases is of special interest since the presence and nature of a second chromophore in these enzymes are not known in contrast to the microbial photolyases which contain fad cofactor, and folate or deazaflavin as second chromophores.  this conclusion is supported by the phylogenetic distribution and prevalence of metameric phyla in the cambrian, and the similarity of the genomes and segmentation mechanisms across current bilaterian phyla.  vertebrate genomes are mosaics of isochores.  phylogenetic and ancestral state reconstruction analysis revealed an arthropod-specific set gene family, named smyda, that is ancestral to arthropod animals and specifically diversified during insect evolution. ||| ",no
Are circRNAs associated with diseases and traits?,"recent researches show that circrnas are closely associated with numerous chronic human diseases.  studies have shown that circrnas are involved in a variety of biological processes and play an important role in the development of various complex diseases, so the identification of circrna-disease associations would contribute to the diagnosis and treatment of diseases.  growing evidence from recent experiments reveals that dysregulations and abnormal expressions of circrnas are correlated with complex diseases.  dysregulation of circrnas is associated with the development and progression of several diseases, such as diabetes mellitus, nervous system diseases, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer.  identification of circrna-disease associations will contribute towards diagnosing the pathogenesis of diseases.  in this review, we summarize the discovery, classifications and functions of circrnas and introduce four important diseases associated with circrnas.  furthermore, case studies of predicted circrnas for specific diseases and the top predicted circrna-disease associations are analyzed.  genetic variation of circrnas may affect complex traits/diseases by changing their binding efficiency to target mirnas and proteins.  circrnas are pleiotropic molecules whose dysregulation has been linked to human diseases and can drive cancer by impacting gene expression and signaling pathways.  additionally, recent studies show that circrnas participate in some pathological processes.  accumulating evidence shows that circular rnas (circrnas) have significant roles in human health and in the occurrence and development of diseases.  circular rnas (circrnas) are a class of novel rnas with important biological functions, and aberrant expression of circrnas has been implicated in human diseases.  our results reveal technical, biological, and genetic factors affecting circrna expression variation among individuals, which lead to further understanding of circrna regulation and thus of the genetic architecture of complex traits or diseases.  the detection of circrnas aberrantly expressed in disease conditions calls for the investigation of their functions.  circular rnas (circrnas) are implicated in various biological processes.  recent evidence suggests that many endogenous circular rnas (circrnas) may play roles in biological processes.  increasing studies have demonstrated that circrnas play a crucial role in biology processes.  next, we introduce some state-of-the-art computational models for predicting novel circrna-disease associations and divide them into two categories, namely network algorithm-based and machine learning-based models.  biological researchers have identified disease-related circrnas that could be considered as potential biomarkers for clinical diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment.  abnormal expression of circrnas (circular rnas), a subclass of non-coding rnas, has been documented in numerous human diseases. ||| ",yes
Are conserved noncoding elements associated with developmental genes?,"multi-species conserved non-coding elements occur in the vertebrate genome and are clustered in the vicinity of developmentally regulated genes.  conserved noncoding elements (cnes) in vertebrate genomes often act as developmental enhancers, but a critical issue is how well orthologous cne sequences retain the same activity in their respective species, a characteristic important for generalization of model organism studies.  conserved noncoding genomic sequences are candidate regulatory elements.  highly conserved non-coding elements (cnes) linked to genes involved in embryonic development have been hypothesised to correspond to cis-regulatory modules due to their ability to induce tissue-specific expression patterns.  these highly conserved non-coding elements (cnes) are associated with genes that coordinate development, and have been proposed to act as transcriptional enhancers.  conserved non-coding elements (cnes) are an abundant group of putative regulatory sequences that are highly conserved across divergent groups and thus assumed to be under strong selective constraint.  developmental genes in metazoan genomes are surrounded by dense clusters of conserved noncoding elements (cnes).  conserved noncoding elements (cnes) are elements exhibiting extreme noncoding conservation in metazoan genomes.  the genomes of vertebrates, flies, and nematodes contain highly conserved noncoding elements (cnes).  pan-vertebrate developmental cis-regulatory elements are discernible as highly conserved noncoding elements (hcnes) and are often dispersed over large areas around the pleiotropic genes whose expression they control.  comparative analyses of various mammalian genomes have identified numerous conserved non-coding (cnc) dna elements that display striking conservation among species, suggesting that they have maintained specific functions throughout evolution.  a part of gene regulatory elements are expected to be conserved according to their functional importance, so that evolutionarily conserved noncoding sequences (cnss) might be good candidates for those elements.  the identification of ultraconserved noncoding sequences in vertebrates has been associated with developmental regulators and dna-binding proteins.  many conserved non-coding elements (cnes) in vertebrate genomes have been shown to function as tissue-specific enhancers.  the close correspondence between extreme noncoding conservation and tads suggests that these tads are ancient, revealing a regulatory architecture conserved over hundreds of millions of years.metazoan genomes contain many clusters of conserved noncoding elements.  often these ""conserved non-coding elements,"" or cnes, can direct gene expression to specific tissues in transgenic models, demonstrating they have regulatory function.  vertebrate genomes include gene regulatory elements in protein-noncoding regions.  conserved noncoding sequences (cnss) have recently been identified in mammalian genes through cross-species genomic dna comparisons, and some have been shown to be regulatory sequences.  the majority of dna contained within vertebrate genomes is non-coding, with a certain proportion of this thought to play regulatory roles during development.  cnes are frequently found near ""developmental"" genes, particularly transcription factors, implying that these elements have essential regulatory roles in development. ||| ",yes
Are conserved noncoding elements associated with the evolution of animal body plans?,"our results indicate that conserved non-coding elements (cnes) consist of blocks with distinct evolutionary history, each having been frozen since different evolutionary era along the vertebrate lineage.  here, we use a new computational method to identify phylogenetically conserved noncoding elements (pcnes) in a manner that is not biased by rearrangement and duplication.  genes involved in vertebrate development are unusually enriched for highly conserved non-coding sequence elements.  the genomes of vertebrates, flies, and nematodes contain highly conserved noncoding elements (cnes).  recent evidence supports the proposal that the observed diversity of animal body plans has been produced through alterations to the complexity of the regulatory genome rather than increases in the protein-coding content of a genome.  gene regulatory changes drive animal development and play major roles during evolution of animal body plans.  distantly related animals have spectacularly different shapes and body plans, which can render it difficult to understand which of their body parts may have a shared evolutionary origin.  evolutionary changes in cis-regulatory elements are thought to play a key role in morphological and physiological diversity across animals.  evolution of animal body plans occurs with changes in the encoded genomic programs that direct development, by alterations in the structure of encoded developmental gene-regulatory networks (grns).  due to the subsequent stability of animal body plans, these core regulatory sequences have been evolving in parallel under strong purifying selection in different animal groups.  most of them were also conserved among vertebrates.  it is now clear that animal genomes are predominantly non-protein-coding, and that these sequences encode a wide array of rna transcripts and other regulatory elements that are fundamental to the development of complex life.  here, we discuss the evidence that cnes are part of the core gene regulatory networks (grns) that specify alternative animal body plans.  researchers have proposed that the strong conservation of these sequences may affect the evolution of the surrounding genome, both by repressing rearrangement, and possibly by promoting duplicate gene retention.  because they tend to be located in the flanking regions of developmental genes, they would have fundamental roles in creating vertebrate body plans.  data on nonbilaterian animals (sponges, cnidarians, and ctenophores) have suggested that antennapedia (antp) class homeobox genes played a crucial role in the early diversification of animal body plans.  the discovery that most regulatory genes were conserved among animals from distant phyla challenged the ideas that gene duplication and divergence of homologous coding sequences were the basis for major morphological changes in metazoan evolution.  non-coding rnas play roles in embryonic development of animals and these functions might be expected to evolve rapidly.  given that many developmental processes are strikingly similar across all backboned animals, it is reasonable to expect these sequences to be conserved at the nucleotide level, their potential for mutation being constrained by their function.  our results indicate that prototypical uces originated before the divergence of jawed and jawless vertebrates and have been frozen as perfect conserved sequences in the jawed vertebrate lineage. ||| ",yes
Are cutaneous porphyrias inherited with a recessive pattern?,"porphyria cutanea tarda may be inherited, but is more commonly acquired.  the manifestation of porphyria cutanea tarda reflects genetic and environmental factors.  however, a few cases of late-onset recessive porphyrias have been reported.  the mendelian inheritance pattern of acute intermittent porphyria, hereditary coproporphyria, and variegate porphyria is autosomal dominant, but the clinical phenotype is heterogeneous.  the porphyrias are a group of inherited disorders that result in defects in the enzymes of the haem biosynthetic pathway, causing photosensitive bullous skin eruptions or abdominal and neurological attacks.  porphyrias are inherited disorders of heme biosynthesis.  the porphyrias are a rare group of metabolic disorders that can either be inherited or acquired.  the cutaneous porphyrias present with either bullous skin fragility or nonbullous acute photosensitivity.  these findings suggest that these late-onset porphyrias may be heterozygous for their gene defects, but clinical expression may be elicited if there is a loss of heterozygosity, either by a clonal expansion of the porphyric allele or by a loss of function mutation in the other allele.  the porphyrias are a group of rare metabolic disorders, inherited or acquired, along the heme biosynthetic pathway, which could manifest with neurovisceral and/or cutaneous symptoms, depending on the defective enzyme.  thirteen patients (25%) had familial porphyria cutanea tarda.  occasionally two forms of porphyria may co-exist.  mutations in the uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase gene, located at chromosome 1p34, discriminate familial porphyria cutanea tarda from sporadic cases.  individuals with the most common form of the porphyrias, porphyria cutanea tarda (pct), are believed to be genetically predisposed to development of clinically overt disease through mutations and polymorphisms in genes associated with known precipitating factors.  eight patients with porphyria cutanea tarda (15%) were homozygous for the haemochromatosis gene c282y mutation and 8 patients were heterozygous.  porphyrias are a family of rare diseases chiefly due to inborn errors of heme biosynthesis.  this seems to confirm a relationship between porphyria cutanea tarda and haemochromatosis.  a form of porphyria inherited as a mendelian dominant characteristic can cause both cutaneous lesions on the exposed skin and attacks of acute porphyria following certain drugs, for instance barbiturates.  the porphyrias are a group of mainly inherited disorders of heme biosynthesis where accumulation of porphyrins and/or porphyrin precursors gives rise to 2 types of clinical presentation: cutaneous photosensitivity and/or acute neurovisceral attacks.  the non-acute porphyrias are largely dermatological conditions, which present clinically as cutaneous photosensitivity. ||| ",no
Are cyclophilins proteins that bind to prolines?,"cyclophilins are ubiquitously expressed proteins that bind to prolines and can catalyse cis/trans isomerization of proline residues.  cyclophilins belong to a group of proteins that possess peptidyl prolyl isomerase activity and catalyse the cis-trans conversion of proline peptide bonds.  cyclophilins (cyp) are a family of cellular enzymes possessing peptidyl-prolyl isomerase activity, which catalyze the cis-trans interconversion of proline-containing peptide bonds.  cyclophilins are peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerases (ppiase) that catalyse the interconversion of the peptide bond at proline residues.  cyclophilin proteins are the members of immunophillin group of proteins, known for their property of binding to the immune-suppressant drug cyclosporin a, hence named as cyclophilins.  cyclophilins (cyps) are a family of proteins found in organisms ranging from prokaryotes to humans.  the cyclophilins are a large family of proteins implicated in folding, transport and regulation of other proteins and are potential drug targets in cancer and in some viral and parasitic infections.  cyclophilins constitute a ubiquitous protein family whose functions include protein folding, transport and signaling.  the cyclophilins (cyps) are family members of proteins that exhibit peptidylprolyl cis-trans isomerase (ppiase, ec 5.2.1.8) activity and bind the immunosuppressive agent cyclosprin a (csa) in varying degrees.  they possess both sequence-specific binding and proline cis-trans isomerase activities, as exemplified by the interaction between cyclophilin a (cypa) and the hiv-1 ca protein.  cyclophilins are enzymes catalyzing the cis-trans isomerization of peptidyl-prolyl bonds and belong to the enzyme class of peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerases (ppiases), which includes two more families (fk506 binding proteins and parvulins).  in some cases, cyclophilins have also been shown to form stable complexes with specific proteins in vivo and may thus also act as chaperone-like molecules.  cyclophilins (cyps) are binding proteins for the immunosuppressive drug cyclosporin a (csa).  cyclophilins (cyps) constitute a highly conserved family of proteins present in a wide variety of organisms.  cyclophilins belong to the enzyme class of peptidyl prolyl cis-trans isomerases which catalyze the cis-trans isomerization of prolyl bonds in peptides and proteins in different folding states.  cyclophilins (cyps) define a family of proteins binding to the immunosuppressive drug cyclosporin a (csa).  cyclophilins belong to the superfamily of peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerases (ppiases, ec: 5.2.1.8), the enzymes that catalyze the cis/trans isomerization of peptidyl-prolyl peptide bonds in unfolded and partially folded polypeptide chains and native state proteins.  cyclophilins (cyps) catalyze the cis/trans isomerization of peptidyl-prolyl bonds, a rate-limiting step in protein folding.  cyclophilins belong to the family of peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerases (ppiases), which are ubiquitous and highly conserved enzymes capable of cis/trans isomerizing xaa-pro peptide bonds.  although numerous biological roles have now been discovered for cyclophilins, their function was initially ascribed to their chaperone-like activity in protein folding where they catalyze the often rate-limiting step of proline isomerization. ||| ",yes
Are cyclophilins ubiquitously expressed?,"cyclophilins (cyps) are ubiquitously expressed proteins that are evolutionarily conserved.  cyclophilins (cyps) constitute a highly conserved family of proteins present in a wide variety of organisms.  many cyclophilins, including cypa, cypb, cypc, cypd, and cyp40, have been discovered and shown to be ubiquitously distributed in many types of cells and organ systems.  cyclophilins (cyps), a member of peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerases (ppiases), are ubiquitously distributed in organisms such as bacteria, yeast, plants and animals.  cyclophilins are proteins which are remarkably conserved through evolution; moreover they have been found in every possible existing organism, which indicates their fundamental importance.  cyclophilins are an abundant and ubiquitous class of proteins first identified by their high affinity for the immunosuppressive drug cyclosporin a. cyclophilins have peptidylprolyl cis/trans-isomerase activity in vitro, and thus may be involved in protein folding and trafficking in vivo.  cyclophilins catalyze the reversible peptidyl-prolyl isomerization of their substrates and are present across all kingdoms of life from humans to bacteria.  cyclophilins, which bind to immunosuppressant cyclosporin a (csa), are ubiquitous proteins and constitute a multigene family in higher organisms.  cyclophilins are a family of ubiquitous proteins that are the intracellular target of the immunosuppressant drug cyclosporin a.  cyclophilins (cyps), a highly-conserved family of proteins, belong to a subgroup of immunophilins.  the cyclophilins are members of a highly conserved, ubiquitous family, and play an important role in protein folding, immunosuppression by cyclosporin a (csa), and infection of hiv-1 virions.  these results suggest that this ubiquitously expressed b. germanica cyclophilin is subject to a differential regulation in tissues and during development.  cyclophilin a (cypa), the most abundantly expressed cyclophilin, is present mainly in the cytoplasm and is a host factor involved in the life cycle of multiple viruses.  cyclophilins (cyps) are ubiquitous proteins involved in a wide variety of processes including protein maturation and trafficking, receptor complex stabilization, apoptosis, receptor signaling, rna processing, and spliceosome assembly.  cyclophilins are originally identified as cellular binding proteins for the immunosuppressive drug cyclosporin a.  cyclophilins are ubiquitously expressed proteins that bind to prolines and can catalyse cis/trans isomerization of proline residues.  cyclophilins (cyps) are a family of peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerases consistently involved in cardiovascular diseases through the inflammation pathway.  most cyclophilins display ppiase enzymatic activity, multiplicity, diverse cellular locations and active role in protein folding which render them to be included in the class of diverse set of proteins called molecular chaperones.  the cyclophilins are a group of proteins with peptidyl-prolyl isomerase enzymatic activity, localised in different cellular compartments and involved in a variety of functions related to cell metabolism and energy homeostasis, having enhanced expression in inflammation or malignancy.  molecular mechanisms of cyclophilin-mediated biologic events and future directions of research are discussed in this review. ||| ",yes
Are defects in recombination repair involved in carcinogenesis?,"cancer cells are often defective in one of six major dna repair pathways, namely: mismatch repair, base excision repair, nucleotide excision repair, homologous recombination, nonhomologous endjoining and translesion synthesis.  although disruption of dna repair capacity is unquestionably associated with cancer susceptibility in humans and model organisms, it remains unclear if the inherent tumor phenotypes of dna repair deficiency syndromes can be regulated by manipulating dna repair pathways.  common polymorphisms in dna repair genes may alter protein function and an individual's capacity to repair damaged dna; deficits in repair capacity may lead to genetic instability and carcinogenesis.  defects of mismatch repair are thought to be responsible for carcinogenesis in hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer and about 15% of sporadic colon cancers.  until recently, only two repair pathways, postreplicative mismatch repair and nucleotide excision repair, have been linked to cancer in mammals, but these have been joined in recent months also by the damage-reversal and base-excision-repair processes, which have been shown to be inactivated, either through mutation or epigenetically, in human cancer.  it now appears that a clinically significant fraction of cancers have acquired dna repair defects.  defects in the dna mismatch repair process dramatically increase the risk for specific types of cancer because of instability in microsatellite dna sequences.  a polymorphic variant of excision repair cross-complementation group 1 (ercc1) (the dna repair gene) may be associated with carcinogenesis due to reduced dna repair capacity.  participation of dna repair systems in the pathogenesis of cancer has been a suspected phenomenon for a long time.  to establish our overall understanding of possible in vivo relationships between dna repair polymorphisms and the development of cancer, we performed a literature review of epidemiological studies that assessed associations between such polymorphisms and risk of cancer.  defects in cloned dna repair genes are now associated with particular human disorders in which an important feature is a predisposition to cancer.  hereditary and sporadic cancers in various tissues have been reported to have mutations at the dna repair genes.  it has been suggested that inactivation of dna repair pathways, which leads to an increased mutation rate and chromosomal instability, can initiate and accelerate the neoplastic process.  various dna alterations by environmental or endogenous carcinogens, if not repaired, can cause genetic mutagenesis, resulting in carcinogenesis.  dna repair is a double-edged sword in lung carcinogenesis.  decreased efficiency in dna repair translates to their ability to fix and consequently leads to mutations and the process of carcinogenesis.  deficiency in dna repair capability is considered to be responsible for oncogenesis.  it is generally known that replication errors (rers) at microsatellite loci detected in human malignancies reflect a genetic instability that is caused by abnormalities of dna mismatch repair system and underlie human carcinogenesis.  human cancers exhibit genomic instability and an increased mutation rate due to underlying defects in dna repair.  defects in dna repair can result in oncogenic genomic instability. ||| ",yes
Are deletions of chromosomal regulatory boundaries associated with congenital disease?,"regulatory mutations that cause the misexpression of key developmental genes may underlie a number of developmental abnormalities.  complex chromosomal rearrangements and chromosomal deletion and duplication syndromes are commonly associated with abnormal clinical phenotypes.  chromosome deletions leading to the hemizygous loss of groups of contiguous genes are a major cause of human congenital defects.  chromosomal abnormalities are implicated in a substantial number of human developmental syndromes, but for many such disorders little is known about the causative genes.  apparently balanced chromosomal inversions may lead to disruption of developmentally important genes at the breakpoints of the inversion, causing congenital malformations.  chromosomal rearrangements causing microdeletions and microduplications are a major cause of congenital malformation and mental retardation.  small deletions and duplications frequently occur in the pericentromeric region of chromosomes and many of these are associated with developmental abnormalities.  most ocular abnormalities have occurred in patients with chromosomal defects.  chromosomal deletions and/or duplications are relatively common cytogenetic abnormalities.  alternately, some chromosomal syndromes may be caused by a deletion or duplication of a single gene with pleiotropic effects.  apparently balanced chromosomal rearrangements in individuals with major congenital anomalies represent natural experiments of gene disruption and dysregulation.  because many chromosomal alterations are large and encompass numerous genes, the ascertainment of individuals with overlapping deletions and varying clinical features may allow researchers to narrow the region in which to search for candidate genes.  identifying the genes that underlie the pathogenesis of chromosome deletion and duplication syndromes is a challenge because the affected chromosomal segment can contain many genes.  recurrent rearrangements of chromosome 1q21.1 that occur via non-allelic homologous recombination have been associated with variable phenotypes exhibiting incomplete penetrance, including congenital heart disease (chd).  the 2q31.1 deletion resulted in the loss of one copy of several known disease genes, including gad1, dcaf17, slc25a12 and itga6 associated with mental retardation and facial abnormalities and dlx1/dlx2 partially associated with limb abnormalities.  these findings show that duplication and deletion at chromosome 1q21.1 exhibit a degree of phenotypic specificity in chd, and implicate gja5 as the gene responsible for the chd phenotypes observed with copy number imbalances at this locus.  these developmental syndromes are conventionally attributed to abnormal expression of protein-coding genes in the affected region.  we found functional relationships among genes from three different duplicated chromosomal regions, reflecting interactions of protein-coding genes and their involvement in common cellular subnetworks.  contiguous gene syndromes are characterized by deletions or duplications of specific chromosomal segments involving clusters of single genes.  many patients suffering from developmental disorders harbor submicroscopic deletions or duplications that, by affecting the copy number of dosage-sensitive genes or disrupting normal gene expression, lead to disease. ||| ",yes
Are epigenetic modifications implicated in cardiovascular development and disease?,"there is a rapidly growing body of evidence that epigenetic modifications are involved in the pathological mechanisms of many cardiovascular diseases (cvds), which intersect with many of the pathways involved in oxidative stress.  this review will discuss the role of epigenetic mechanisms in heart development as well as aberrant epigenetic regulation contributing to cardiovascular disease.  epigenetic modifications of the genome, such as dna methylation and histone modifications, have been reported to play a role in processes underlying cardiovascular disease (cvd), including atherosclerosis, inflammation, hypertension and diabetes.  gene alterations have been found to be associated with cardiovascular diseases, and epigenetic mechanisms are continuously being studied to find new useful strategies for the clinical management of afflicted patients.  epigenetic modifications, such as histone or dna modifications are key regulators of gene transcription and changes are often associated with maladaptive processes underlying cardiovascular disease.  the purpose of this review is to summarize the newest results about the inheritable epigenetic features of cardiovascular diseases.  this review summarizes recent findings in the epigenetics of vascular cells and discusses the new challenges for therapeutic strategies of cardiovascular diseases.  the present study provided a direct evidence that dna methylation is a key epigenetic mechanism contributing to the developmental origins of adult cardiovascular disease.  this review summarizes the different epigenetic aspects involved in cardiac development and disease along with current therapeutic interventions.  epigenetic aberrations caused by environmental factors and lifestyle choices have been associated with the development of a number of pathologies, including cardiovascular disorders.  epigenetic modifications, especially alteration in dna methylation, are increasingly being recognized as a key factor in the pathogenesis of complex disorders, including atherosclerosis.  epigenetic mechanisms might play a role in the pathophysiology of hypertension, a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease and renal failure.  epigenetic mechanisms, including dna methylation and histone post-translational modifications (ptms), have been known to regulate chromatin structure and lineage-specific gene expression during cardiovascular development and disease.  several association studies have been carried out to elucidate the role of genetic variants in cardiovascular diseases (cvds), while studies on the epigenome regulating gene expression changes are helping to understand the development of disease and factors promoting such changes.  here, we describe main human epigenetic mechanisms involved in atherosclerosis, coronary heart disease, ischemic stroke, peripheral artery disease; cardiomyopathy and heart failure.  we also explore the establishment of epigenetic cues that may lead to hypertension at the vascular level such as dna methylation, histone modifications (methylation and acetylation), and the role of micrornas in the endothelial cells and blood vessel smooth muscle which participate in hypertension.  we aimed to systematically review studies investigating the association between epigenetic marks (global, candidate-gene or genome-wide methylation of dna, and histone modifications) and blood pressure or hypertension.  recent studies suggest that epigenetic changes which may arise as a consequence of environmental factors play an important role in predisposition to disease.  epigenetic modifications which are defined by dna methylation, histone modifications and microrna mediated gene regulation, have been found to be associated with cardiac dysfunction and cardiac regeneration but the mechanisms are unclear.  the development of new chromatin modifying drugs indicates that targeting epigenetic changes is a promising approach to reduce the burden of cardiovascular disease in this setting. ||| ",yes
Are genes symmetrically distributed between leading and lagging DNA strand in bacteria?,"many bacterial chromosomes display nucleotide asymmetry, or skew, between the leading and lagging strands of replication.  among prokaryotic genomes, the distribution of genes on the leading and lagging strands of the replication fork is known to be biased.  the nucleotide compositions of most bacteria differ between the leading and lagging dna strands.  in many bacteria, there is a strong bias for genes to be encoded on the leading strand of dna, resulting in coorientation of replication and transcription.  while all bacteria have a preference for gs over cs on the leading strand, we discover that the direction of the a/t skew is determined by the polymerase-alpha subunit that replicates the leading strand.  studies had found that bacterial genes are preferentially located on the leading strands.  in bacteria, most genes are on the leading strand of replication, a phenomenon attributed to collisions between the dna and rna polymerases.  it has been suggested that in bacteria such as bacillus subtilis, polc is responsible for the synthesis of the leading strand and dnae for the lagging strand, whereas in many other bacteria dnae is responsible for the synthesis of both strands.  strand biases are widespread in bacterial genomes.  this suggests that asymmetrical replication forks could have a major role in defining and constraining the structure of the bacterial chromosome.  bacterial genetic information is generally carried on a circular chromosome with a single origin of replication from which two replication forks proceed bidirectionally toward the opposite terminus region.  it is hoped that this review will improve the understanding of the extent and reasons for various types of strand bias in bacterial genomes.  we describe a model to quantify the contribution of mutational differences between the leading and lagging strands in producing replication-induced skew.  such a pattern could also arise from selection coupled with a bias for genes coded on the leading strand.  our results in c. acetobutylicum indicate that there is little asymmetry between 2 replication strands on open reading frame number and gene length, whereas the other 3 features presented significant strand bias.  in this work we have analyzed 211 prokaryotic genomes in terms of compositional strand asymmetries and the presence or absence of polc and have found that sgd correlates not only with polc, but also with purine asymmetry (pas).  as in eukaryotes, bacterial genomes are not randomly folded.  in this review, we discuss 5 types of bias, including gene orientation, the number of open reading frames, nucleotide composition, substitution rate, and gene length, between leading and lagging strands during replication.  the results demonstrated the continuous influence of essentiality on orientation bias and provided details on this visible structural feature of bacterial genomes.  and many experiences prove that the genes between leading strand and lagging strand is distinctly in copy, transcription and repair. ||| ",no
Are hepadnaviral minichromosomes free of nucleosomes?,"this study supplies the initial framework for the understanding of the overall complete structure of hepadnaviral cccdna minichromosomes.  these results imply that the nucleosomes along viral cccdna in the minichromosomes are not random but sequence-specifically positioned.  non-transcribed minichromosomes eluted from nuclei but transcriptionally active ones did not.  the results show that the two types of minichromosome contain the same number of nucleosomes as well as nucleosomal structure.  the transcriptional regulatory region of the simian virus 40 minichromosome that is being transcribed in the cell is nucleosome-free, while that of the non-transcribed minichromosome is nucleosome covered.  when encapsidated in virus particles, the viral dna is devoid of any nucleosomes.  hepadnaviruses are dna viruses but, as pararetroviruses, their morphogenesis initiates with the encapsidation of an rna pregenome, and these viruses have therefore evolved mechanisms to exclude nucleocapsids that contain incompletely matured genomes from participating in budding and secretion.  in contrast to cellular chromatin the nucleosomal spacing of the hbv minichromosome has been shown to be unusually reduced by approximately 10 %.  hepadnaviral covalently closed circular dna (cccdna) exists as an episomal minichromosome in the nucleus of virus-infected hepatocytes, and serves as the transcriptional template for the synthesis of viral mrnas.  to obtain insight on the structure of hepadnaviral cccdna minichromosomes, we utilized ducks infected with the duck hepatitis b virus (dhbv) as a model and determined the in vivo nucleosome distribution pattern on viral cccdna by the micrococcal nuclease (mnase) mapping and genome-wide pcr amplification of isolated mononucleosomal dhbv dna.  moreover, late viral replication compartments are also devoid of histones.  covalently closed circular dna (cccdna) of hepadnaviruses exists as an episomal minichromosome in the nucleus of an infected hepatocyte and serves as the template for the transcription of viral mrnas.  covalently closed circular dna (cccdna) of hepadnaviruses exists as an episomal minichromosome in the nucleus of infected hepatocyte and serves as the transcriptional template for viral mrna synthesis.  the viral dna lacks histones when encapsidated in the virion.  our findings, confirmed by in vivo and in vitro experiments indicate that hbv core protein is a component of the hbv minichromosome, binds preferentially to hbv double-stranded dna, and its binding results in a reduction of the nucleosomal spacing of the hbv nucleoprotein complexes by 10 %.  viral minichromosomes provide simple models for chromatin domains.  we show that hpv origin-containing plasmids partition as minichromosomes, attributable to an association of the viral origin recognition protein e2 with mitotic spindles.  however, hsv-1 genomes do not interact with histones in virions and are deposited in nuclear domains devoid of histones.  we suggest that the monomeric and oligomeric linear dnas produced by illegitimate replication may be precursors of the integrated and other high-molecular-weight hepadnaviral dna forms seen in chronic infection.  our results indicate that components of the host cell nucleosome deposition machinery target intranuclear cmv dna, resulting in stepwise viral-chromatin assembly. ||| ",no
Are high-flow nasal cannulae effective for treatment of preterm infants?,"high-flow nasal cannula (hfnc) therapy is increasingly used in preterm infants despite a paucity of physiological studies.  the use of high-flow nasal cannulae is an increasingly popular alternative to nasal continuous positive airway pressure (cpap) for noninvasive respiratory support of very preterm infants (gestational age, <32 weeks) after extubation.  to assess the effect of nasal high flow (nhf) cannula on end-expiratory level (eel), continuous distending pressure (cdp) and regional ventilation distribution in preterm infants.  in this multicenter, randomized, noninferiority trial, we assigned 303 very preterm infants to receive treatment with either high-flow nasal cannulae (5 to 6 liters per minute) or nasal cpap (7 cm of water) after extubation.  to compare the feasibility of continuous positive airway pressure (cpap) support generated by high flow nasal cannula with conventional cpap for prevention of reintubation among preterm infants with a birth weight of <or=1,250 g. preterm infants were randomized to cpap generated via high flow cannula or the infant flow nasal cpap system (viasys, conshohocken, pa, usa) at extubation.  although the result for the primary outcome was close to the margin of noninferiority, the efficacy of high-flow nasal cannulae was similar to that of cpap as respiratory support for very preterm infants after extubation.  high-flow nasal cannulae (hfnc) are gaining in popularity as a form of non-invasive respiratory support for preterm infants in neonatal intensive care units around the world.  cpap delivered by high flow nasal cannula failed to maintain extubation status among preterm infants <or=1,250 g as effectively as infant flow cpap.  heated, humidified, high-flow nasal cannula (hhhfnc) is increasingly being used, but there is a paucity of evidence as to the optimum flow rates in prematurely born infants.  high-flow nasal cannulae have been used in newborns to prevent atelectasis and/or expand pulmonary regions affected by atelectasis; however, to date, no evidence-based data regarding this approach have been reported.  humidified high flow nasal cannula (hhfnc) delivers humidified gas at increased flow rates via binasal prongs and is becoming widely accepted as a method of non-invasive respiratory support for preterm infants.  heated, humidified, high-flow nasal cannula (hhfnc) is frequently used as a noninvasive respiratory support for preterm infants with respiratory distress.  in preterm infants, the flow rate and pharyngeal pressure were positively correlated in many hfnc cannulas.  the use of high-flow nasal cannulae was noninferior to the use of nasal cpap, with treatment failure occurring in 52 of 152 infants (34.2%) in the nasal-cannulae group and in 39 of 151 infants (25.8%) in the cpap group (risk difference, 8.4 percentage points; 95% confidence interval, -1.9 to 18.7).  to compare the requirement for endotracheal ventilation in preterm infants treated with heated, humidified high-flow nasal cannula (hhhfnc) with those treated with nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (nippv) for the primary treatment of respiratory distress syndrome (rds).  this finding raises important concerns about the indiscriminate therapeutic use, size selection, and safety of nasal cannulas for the routine delivery of oxygen in preterm infants.  the objective was to determine whether high-flow nasal cannula (hfnc), a promising respiratory support in infant bronchiolitis, could reduce the proportion of treatment failure requiring escalation of care.  these data demonstrate that nasal cannula gas flow can deliver positive end-distending pressure to infants and significantly alter their breathing strategy.  in the clinical setting, nasal cannulas are frequently used to deliver supplemental oxygen to neonates and are not believed to affect the general respiratory status.  what is known: • humidified high flow nasal cannulae (hhhfnc) is increasingly being used as a non-invasive form of respiratory support for prematurely born infants. ||| ",yes
Are histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors good candidates to control metastasis of solid tumors?,"histone deacetylase (hdac) is recognized as one of the promising targets for cancer treatment as many hdac inhibitors have entered clinical trials for both solid and liquid tumors.  histone deacetylase inhibitors (hdaci) are promising therapeutics for cancer.  histone deacetylases (hdacs), which modulate the expression of genes, are potential therapeutic targets in several cancers.  histone deacetylase (hdac) inhibitors are emerging as an exciting new class of potential anti-cancer agents for the treatment of solid and hematological malignancies.  histone deacetylases (hdacs) play an important role in regulating the expression of genes involved in tumorigenesis and tumor maintenance, and hence they have been considered as key targets in cancer therapy.  histone deacetylases (hdacs) are implicated in the pathology of various cancers, and their pharmacological blockade has proven to be promising in reversing the malignant phenotypes.  accumulating evidence demonstrates important roles for histone deacetylase in tumorigenesis (hdacs), highlighting them as attractive targets for antitumor drug development.  histone deacetylase inhibitors (hdaci) have been enthusiastically investigated as a novel generation of chemotherapeutics for cancers usually called as epigenetic therapeutics.  histone deactylase inhibitors (hdacis), which have shown favorable anti-tumor activity with low toxicity in clinical investigations, are a promising class of anticancer therapeutics.  histone deacetylases (hdacs), enzymes involved in chromatin remodeling, are promising targets for anticancer drug development.  histone deacetylase inhibitors (hdaci) are promising antitumor drugs acting through reactivation of silenced tumor suppressor genes.  histone deacetylases (hdacs) are a class of epigenetic modulators overexpressed in numerous types of cancers.  histone deacetylases (hdacs) have gained increased attention as targets for anticancer drug design and development.  histone deacetylases (hdacs) are considered to be among the most promising targets in drug development for cancer therapy, and first-generation histone deacetylase inhibitors (hdaci) are currently being tested in phase i/ii clinical trials.  histone deacetylase inhibitors are novel anticancer agents in clinical development that target the family of histone deacetylase (hdac) enzymes responsible for deacetylating core nucleosomal histones and other proteins.  as a novel category of antitumor agents, histone deacetylase inhibitors (hdacis) can induce cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and differentiation in cancer cells, ultimately combating cancer.  the histone deacetylases (hdacs) are able to regulate gene expression, and inhibitors of the hdacs (hdacis) hold promise in the treatment of cancer as well as a variety of neurodegenerative diseases.  inhibitors of histone deacetylase superfamily (hdac), which induce cell cycle arrest, trigger cell death and reduce angiogenesis appear as promising anti-cancer drugs targeting the epigenetic regulation of gene expression.  histone deacetylases (hdacs) regulate transcription and specific functions, such as tumor suppression by p53, and are frequently altered in cancer.  histone deacetylases (hdacs) are epigenetic regulators of chromatin condensation and decondensation and exert effects on the proliferation and spread of cancer. ||| ",yes
Are immune cells affected in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis?,"the involvement of the immune system in the pathogenesis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is controversial.  there is evidence that immunological factors may involved in pathogenetic mechanisms of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (als).  background: amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (als) has a complex genetic origin, and how immune dysregulation may contribute to als etiology remain unclear.  patients with als have persistent peripheral and central inflammatory responses including abnormally functioning t cells and activated microglia.  amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (als) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by neuronal degeneration and inflammation in the nerves.  our results suggest a systemic immune activation in patients with als.  circulatory immune complexes are increased in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (als) and an autoimmune mechanism has been inferred.  regulatory t-cells are immune-suppressive agents known to be dramatically and progressively decreased in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.  amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (als) is an adult-onset, progressive, motor neuron degenerative disease, in which the role of inflammation is not well established.  amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (als) is a neurodegenerative disease affecting motor neurons.  amyotrophic lateral sclerosis monocytes from rapidly progressing patients had more proinflammatory degs than monocytes from slowly progressing patients.  this increased inflammatory response of peripheral immune cells may provide a potential target for disease-modifying therapy in patients with als.  neuroinflammation is involved in the pathogenesis of als; however, interactions of specific immune cell types and mns are not well studied.  cd8 cytotoxic t cells and natural killer (nk) t cells were significantly increased in our patients with als compared with the control group (p = 0.02 and p = 0.04, respectively).  we earlier developed immune-mediated animal models of als and demonstrated humoral and cellular immune reactions in the nervous system and in the sera of patients and animals.  these results indicate that t cells play an endogenous neuroprotective role in als by modulating a beneficial inflammatory response to neuronal injury.  we recently found a shift toward t helper (th)1/th17 cell-mediated, pro-inflammatory immune responses in the peripheral immune system of als patients, which positively correlated with disease severity and progression.  recent evidence indicates that inflammation is associated with many neurodegenerative diseases including als.  recent studies, however, have demonstrated the presence of inflammatory infiltrates within als spinal cord and suggested the possibility of an immune-mediated process in motor neuron degeneration.  while cognitive deficits are increasingly recognized as common symptoms in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (als), the underlying histopathologic basis for this is not known, nor has the relevance of neuroinflammatory mechanisms and microglial activation to cognitive impairment (ci) in als been systematically analyzed. ||| ",yes
Are integrins part of the extracellular matrix?,"integrins are the principal receptors for extracellular matrix.  integrins are heterodimeric glycoproteins acting as membrane receptors for extracellular matrix components.  integrins are found in adhesion structures, which link the extracellular matrix to cytoskeletal proteins.  integrins are expressed on almost every cell type and are responsible for the linkage of the extracellular matrix with the cytoskeleton.  integrins are cell surface receptors that mediate the physical and functional interactions between a cell and its surrounding extracellular matrix (ecm).  integrins are a complex family of non-covalently linked heterodimeric glycoproteins which function as cell adhesion molecules, interacting with extracellular matrix molecules such as laminin, fibronectin, vitronectin, and collagen, and also having a role in intercellular adhesion.  although integrins are known to mediate adhesive binding of cells to the extracellular matrix, their role in mediating cellular growth, morphology, and differentiation is less clear.  integrins, the major receptors for cell-extracellular matrix (ecm) interactions, regulate multiple cell biological processes including adhesion, migration, proliferation and growth factor-dependent signaling.  in vivo, ligands for integrins are immobilized within extracellular matrices, insoluble sheet-like or fibrous supramolecular complexes that associate with or surround cells.  in vivo, ligands for integrins are immobilized within extracellular matrices, insoluble sheet-like or fibrous supramolecular complexes that associate with or surround cells.  integrins are the prototypic heterodimeric transmembrane matrix receptors with competing affinities for individual extracellular matrix ligands.  this article focuses on integrin α6β4 as a paradigm to illustrate the importance as well as the complexity of integrins in the mediation of cell-matrix interactions.  specific integrin heterodimers preferentially bind to distinct extracellular matrix (ecm) proteins to affect the characteristics of cells or the components of the ecm.  integrins bind to their ligand in the extracellular matrix (ecm), such as fibronectin (fn), through a specific interaction between the amino acid motifs in the ligand, and binding sites in the extracellular domains of the integrin molecule generated jointly by its alpha and beta subunits.  the alpha4beta1 integrin exhibits a distinct distribution from other beta1 integrins after cells have adhered for 1 h to extracellular matrix proteins but is localized in adhesion structures after 24 h of adhesion.  integrin-linked kinase organizes the connections of the extracellular matrix via integrins to the cytoskeleton and is involved in adhesion plaque signalling.  these cell-matrix interactions are thought to be mediated largely through a family of cell surface receptors termed integrins.  αvβ3 integrin can bind to multiple extracellular matrix proteins, including vitronectin (vn) and fibronectin (fn), which are often presented to cells in culture as homogenous substrates.  here, we attempt to further define the distribution of beta1 integrins in the context of their association with matrix proteins and other cell surface molecules relevant to the endocytic process.  cells are capable of adhering to and migrating on protein components of the extracellular matrix. ||| ",yes
Are long non coding RNAs as conserved in sequence as protein coding genes?,"while few long non-coding rnas are conserved at the sequence level, many long non-coding rnas have been identified that only share a position relative to other genes.  the obtained results persuaded us to postulate the new hypothesis that, unlike protein coding genes, long non-coding genes tend to preserve their regulatory machinery rather than their transcribed sequence.  long non-coding transcripts originating from the dna segment present between the protein coding genes are termed as long intergenic non-coding rnas (lincrnas).  long non-coding rnas (lncrnas), representing a large proportion of non-coding transcripts across the human genome, are evolutionally conserved and biologically functional.  non-coding rnas constitute a major portion of the transcriptome in most of eukaryotes.  many non-coding rnas with known functions are structurally conserved: their intramolecular secondary and tertiary interactions are maintained across evolutionary time.  long non-coding rnas (lncrnas) represent a novel class of non-coding rnas having a crucial role in many biological processes.  long non-coding rnas (lncrnas) are transcripts longer than 200 bp with no protein-coding capacity.  non-protein-coding rnas have increasingly been shown to be an important class of regulatory rnas having significant roles in regulation of gene expression.  besides the well-established protein coding rnas (messenger rnas, mrnas), long non-coding rnas (lncrnas) have gained the attention of recent researchers.  although lncrnas have been classified as non-coding, some authors reported the presence of corresponding sequences in ribosome profiling data (ribo-seq).  long non-coding rna (lncrnas) are functional rna segments longer than 200 nucleotides, which are considered a redundant transcriptional product.  the largest class of noncoding genes is known as long noncoding rnas (lncrnas), which are transcripts greater in length than 200 nucleotides, but with no protein-coding capacity.  only a small portion of human long non-coding rnas (lncrnas) appear to be conserved outside of mammals, but the events underlying the birth of new lncrnas in mammals remain largely unknown.  we show that promoter regions encode relevant information for the conservation of long non-coding genes across species and that such information is better captured by alignment-free metrics.  the long noncoding rna (lncrna) gene family presently constitutes a large number of noncoding rna (ncrna) loci almost equaling the number of protein-coding genes.  consequently, the presence of conserved structure in multiple sequence alignments can be used to identify candidate functional non-coding rnas.  high throughput rna sequencing techniques have revealed that a large fraction of the genome is transcribed into long non-coding rnas (lncrnas).  however, unlike protein coding genes the poor sequence conservation of long non-coding genes makes the identification of their homologs a challenging task.  it has been well accepted that the rna secondary structures of most functional non-coding rnas (ncrnas) are closely related to their functions and are conserved during evolution. ||| ",no
Are long non coding RNAs spliced?,"while there exist some long non-coding rnas (lncrnas) that are structurally similar to mrnas (capped, spliced, poly a tail), not all of the lncrnas exhibit these features.  long non-coding rnas (lncrnas) are untranslated transcripts with longer than 200 nucleotides (nt), which possess many of the structural characteristics of mrnas, including a poly a tail, 5'-capping, and a promoter structure, but no conserved open reading frame.  long non-coding rnas (lncrnas) are functional rnas longer than 200 nucleotides in length.  long noncoding rnas (lncrnas) are noncoding transcripts usually longer than 200 nts that have recently emerged as one of the largest and significantly diverse rna families.  long noncoding rnas (lncrnas) are arbitrarily defined as rna genes larger than 200 nt in length that have no apparent coding potential.  long non-coding rna (lncrnas) are functional rna segments longer than 200 nucleotides, which are considered a redundant transcriptional product.  long non-coding rnas (lncrnas) are untranslated regulatory transcripts longer than 200 nucleotides that can play a role in transcriptional, post-translational, and epigenetic regulation.  long non-coding rnas (lncrnas) represent a class of riboregulators that either directly act in long form or are processed into shorter micrornas (mirnas) and small interfering rnas.  this review guides the reader through important aspects of non-coding rna biology.  the non-coding rna (ncrna) are generally classified, based on length, into small ncrnas less than 200 nucleotides, such as mirna, and long ncrna (lnrna) with more than 200 nucleotides.  non-coding rnas (ncrnas) are functional ribonucleic acid (rna) species that include micrornas (mirs), a class of short non-coding rnas (∼21-25 nucleotides), and long non-coding rnas (lncrnas) consisting of more than 200 nucleotides.  long intergenic noncoding rnas (lincrnas) have been suggested as playing important roles in human gene regulation.  eukaryotic cells contain small, highly abundant, nuclear-localized non-coding rnas  which play important roles in splicing of introns from primary genomic transcripts.  transcriptionally non-co-linear (ncl) transcripts can originate from trans-splicing (trans-spliced rna; 'tsrna') or cis-backsplicing (circular rna; 'circrna').  non-coding rnas (ncrnas) are untranslated rna molecules that regulate gene expressions.  circular rnas (circrnas) have long been considered as another type of non-coding rna (ncrna) due to the absence of the 5' cap structure.  recent experimental evidence suggests that most of the genome is transcribed into non-coding rnas.  noncoding rnas are untranslated rna molecules that can be divided into two main types: infrastructural, including transfer rnas (trnas) and ribosomal rnas (rrnas), and regulatory, including long ncrnas (lncrnas) and small ncrnas (srna).  there are several types of non-coding linear rnas such as micrornas (mirna) and long non-coding rnas (lncrna), as well as circular rnas (circrna) consisting of a closed continuous loop.  small nucleolar rnas (snornas) are a class of non-coding rnas that guide the post-transcriptional processing of other non-coding rnas (mostly ribosomal rnas), but have also been implicated in processes ranging from microrna-dependent gene silencing to alternative splicing. ||| ",yes
Are loop domains preserved upon cohesin loss?,"evidence for structural changes of these domains compared to controls suggests that cohesin is required for their full integrity.  recent experiments suggest that the formation of loops might be mediated by loop extrusion factor proteins such as cohesin.  tads and many loops are formed by cohesin and positioned by ctcf.  loop formation and maintenance depend on cohesin's atpase activity and on nipbl-mau2, but not on topological entrapment of dna by cohesin.  we demonstrate that this interaction is specifically required for ctcf-anchored loops and contributes to the positioning of cohesin at ctcf binding sites.  such an activity has been observed for condensin, which forms loops in mitosis, but not for cohesin.  cohesin forms chromatin loops via loop extrusion, a process that involves the formation and enlargement of dna loops.  we show that cohesin binding shows greater lineage- and stage-specificity than ctcf at most agr loci, providing more specificity to the loops.  these structures depend on cohesin, a ring-shaped dna-entrapping adenosine triphosphatase (atpase) complex that has been proposed to form loops by extrusion.  cohesin catalyses the folding of the genome into loops that are anchored by ctcf1.  during loop formation, cohesin and nipbl-mau2 reside at the base of loops, which indicates that they generate loops by extrusion.  we explore here several physical scenarios, where loop maintenance is due to diffusing cross-linkers (cohesin stabilized by two ctcf molecules) that can bind and unbind at the base of chromatin loops.  in this review, we discuss recent insights and consider how cohesin and ctcf together may orchestrate the folding of the genome into chromosomal loops.  the cohesin complex mediates dna-dna interactions both between (sister chromatid cohesion) and within chromosomes (dna looping).  recently, global mapping of pairwise contacts showed that loops anchoring topological domains (tads) are highly conserved between cell types and species.  our data suggest that ctcf enables the formation of chromatin loops by protecting cohesin against loop release.  our results indicate that ctcf and the acetyltransferase esco1 protect a subset of cohesinstag1 complexes from wapl, thereby enable formation of long and presumably long-lived loops, and that esco1, like ctcf, contributes to boundary formation in chromatin looping.  cohesin is hypothesized to be the main driver of these long-range chromatin interactions by the process of loop extrusion.  using super-resolution microscopy, we visualize that loops in intact nuclei are formed by a scaffold of cohesin complexes from which the dna protrudes.  our data are consistent with a model of nested loop extrusion, in which acetylated cohesinstag1 forms stable loops between ctcf sites, demarcating the boundaries of more transient cohesinstag2 extrusion activity. ||| ",no
Are messenger RNA molecules epigenetically methylated?,"rna methylation is an important epigenetic modification.  methylation is a prevalent posttranscriptional modification of rnas.  there are several identified methylation modifications in eukaryotic messenger rna (mrna), such as n(7)-methylguanosine (m(7)g) at the cap, n(6)-methyl-2'-o-methyladenosine (m(6)am), 2'-o-methylation (nm) within the cap and the internal positions, and internal n(6)-methyladenosine (m(6)a) and 5-methylcytosine (m(5)c).  rna methylation is a kind of rna modification that exists widely in eukaryotes and prokaryotes.  rna methylation occurs not only in mrna but also in ncrna.  emerging data support that rna methylation plays important roles in rna processing and metabolism.  rna methylation is involved in many physiological and pathological processes.  the importance of rna methylation in biological processes is an emerging focus of investigation.  the messenger rna (mrna) methylations in mammalian cells have been found to contain n6-methyladenosine (m6a), n6-2'-o-dimethyladenosine (m6am), 7-methylguanosine (m7g), 1-methyladenosine (m1a), 5-methylcytosine (m5c), and 2'-o-methylation (2'-ome).  literature reports that mature microrna (mirna) can be methylated at adenosine, guanosine and cytosine.  messenger rna (mrna) methylation modification accounts for more than 60% of all rna modifications and n6-methyladenosine (m6a) is known as one of the most common type of eukaryotic mrna methylation modifications in current.  together, our results indicate that the dnmt3a/ago4-mediated cytosine methylation of mirna negatively.  dna methylation is a mechanism of epigenetic modification in eukaryotic organisms.  an emerging body of evidence shows that methylation on mrnas affects diverse aspects of rna metabolism, including stability, splicing, nucleus-to-cytoplasm export, alternative polyadenylation, and translation.  methylation of rna bases such as n 6-methyladenosine (m6a) and 5-methylcytidine (m5c) is the most prevalent mrna modifications found in eukaryotes.  2'-o-methyladenosine (am), 2'-o-methylguanosine (gm), 2'-o-methylcytidine (cm), 2'-o-methyluridine (um), n 6-methyladenosine (m6a), n 1-methylguanosine (m1g), 5-methylcytidine (m5c), and 5-methyluridine (m5u) are representative 2'-o-methylation and base-methylation modified epigenetic marks of rna.  rna methylation plays a significant regulatory role in various of physiological activities and it has gradually become a hotspot of epigenetics in the past decade.  methylation is the most prevalent modification occurring in mrna and the methyl group is mainly decorated in the adenine, cytosine, and guanine base or in the 2'-hydroxyl group of ribose.  this review focuses on the main methylation modifications in mrna to describe their formation, distribution, function and demethylation from the current knowledge and to provide future perspectives on functional studies.  however, whether mammalian micrornas are methylated is unknown. ||| ",yes
Are microRNA (miR) regulated through DNA methylation of their promoters?,"the review highlights the complex interplay between microrna and methylation at dna and mrna level.  microrna genes themselves are regulated through epigenetic mechanisms, such as histone modifications and/or dna methylation of cpg islands.  mirnas and dna methylation are both critical regulators of gene expression.  while a small number of mirnas is known to be regulated by dna methylation, we postulated that such epigenetic regulation is more prevalent.  it has been shown that mirna expression can be regulated by dna methylation and it has been suggested that altered mirna gene methylation might contribute to human tumorigenesis.  the dysregulation of micrornas (mirnas) contributes to the pathogenesis of human malignancies, and mirna expression can be affected by genetic and epigenetic changes, such as methylation of the cpg islands of their promoters.  cross-linking immunoprecipiation qpcr, transfection with methylation/unmethylated mimic mirna, luciferase promoter reporter plasmid, biotin-tagged 3'utr/mrna or mirna experiments and in vivo assays were used to investigate the role of methylated mirnas.  from the total of 2588 known mature mirna 6.9% (180/2588) mirnas have been shown to be epigenetically regulated by dna methylation.  conversely, certain mirnas can directly target dna methyltransferases and bring about their inhibition, thereby affecting the whole genome methylation pattern.  recent studies have demonstrated that epigenetic mechanisms, including dna methylation and histone modification, not only regulate the expression of protein-encoding genes, but also mirnas, such as let-7a, mir-9, mir-34a, mir-124, mir-137, mir-148 and mir-203.  abnormal microrna (mirna) expression has been linked to the development and progression of several human cancers, and such dysregulation can result from aberrant dna methylation.  literature reports that mature microrna (mirna) can be methylated at adenosine, guanosine and cytosine.  we found 64 mirnas to be robustly methylated in hct116 cells; eighteen of them were located in imprinting regions or already reported to be regulated by dna methylation.  dna methylation can inhibit the transcription of mirnas, just like coding genes, by methylating the cpg islands in the promoter regions of mirnas.  micrornas (mirs) modulate the expression of target genes in the signal pathway on transcriptome level.  recent studies have shown that the effect of mirnas on dna methylation by targeting dna methyltransferase (dnmts) and/or mbps plays an important role in various human cancers.  relationships between mir methylation, transcription, gc development, and clinicopathological characteristics were statistically analyzed.  conversely, another subset of mirnas controls the expression of important epigenetic regulators, including dna methyltransferases, histone deacetylases and polycomb group genes.  micrornas (mirnas) are a class of non-coding, single-stranded rna molecules that regulate gene expression at the posttranscriptional level.  methylation of mir cpg islands may significantly down-regulate their transcription regularly. ||| ",yes
Are microtubules marked by glutamylation?,"we showed that microtubules are intensely glutamylated in all stages of the cell cycle, including interphase.  posttranslational glutamylation of tubulin is present on selected subsets of microtubules in cells.  microtubule glutamylation is an important modulator of microtubule function and has been implicated in the regulation of centriole stability, neuronal outgrowth and cilia motility.  glutamylation of the microtubules is catalyzed by a family of tubulin tyrosine ligase-like (ttll) enzymes.  here we demonstrate that glutamylation, and in particular the generation of long glutamate side chains, promotes the severing of microtubules.  the length of the glutamyl side chain is spatially controlled and microtubule type specific.  moreover, a cell cycle-dependent gradient of glutamylation was observed along the cell anteroposterior axis, which might be related to active growth of the microtubule 'corset' during the cell cycle.  glutamylation is a functionally important tubulin posttranslational modification enriched on stable microtubules of neuronal axons, mitotic spindles, centrioles, and cilia.  the diverse populations of microtubule polymers in cells are functionally distinguished by different posttranslational modifications, including polyglutamylation.  a set of glutamylases and deglutamylases controls levels of tubulin polyglutamylation, a prominent post-translational modification of neuronal microtubules.  strikingly, in the same cell, hyperelongation of glutamyl side chains stabilized cytoplasmic microtubules and destabilized axonemal microtubules.  microtubules can be deglutamylated by the cytosolic carboxypeptidase ccp1.  we have undertaken an analysis of the glutamylating ttll enzymes in c. elegans we find that although all five ttll enzymes are expressed in the embryo and adult worm, loss of individual enzymes does not perturb microtubule function in embryonic cell divisions.  polyglutamylation is enriched on subsets of microtubules including those found in the centrioles, mitotic spindle, and cilia.  microtubules (mts) play crucial roles during neuronal life.  tubulins, building blocks of microtubules, are modified substrates of diverse post-translational modifications including phosphorylation, polyglycylation and polyglutamylation.  we show that in cilia of tetrahymena, ttll6 e-ligases generate glutamylation mainly on the b-tubule of outer doublet microtubules, the site of force production by ciliary dynein.  posttranslational modifications (ptms) such as acetylation, detyrosination, and polyglutamylation have long been considered markers of stable microtubules and have recently been proposed to guide molecular motors to specific subcellular destinations.  glutamylation is a conserved tubulin modification  that is enriched in axonemes.  in vertebrates, balanced activities of tubulin glutamyl ligase and cytoplasmic carboxypeptidase deglutamylase enzymes maintain organelle- and cell type-specific tubulin glutamylation patterns. ||| ",yes
Are mouse chromosomes acrocentric?,"the mouse mus musculus chromosomes are all acrocentric; each centromere (cen) is adjacent to a telomere.  the chromosomes of mammals tend to be either mostly acrocentric (having one long arm) or mostly bi-armed, with few species having intermediate karyotypes.  our results show that b chromosomes are indeed more common in species with acrocentric chromosomes, across all mammals, among rodents, among non-rodents and in a test of independent taxonomic contrasts.  we conclude that the presence of mouse satellite dna in these regions is necessary for maintenance of contact between the sister chromatids of mouse mitotic chromosomes.  the centric end of the acrocentric autosome was found regularly to associate either with the proximal end of the y chromosome or with the ends of nonhomologous autosomal bivalents; the proportions of cells with such configurations varied between pachytene substages and genotypes.  a characteristic karyotypic feature of mouse chromosomes is the presence of large blocks of heterochromatin in the vicinity of the centromeres.  electron microscopy of a large mouse l929 marker chromosome shows that each of its multiple constrictions is coincident with a site of sister chromatid contact and the presence of mouse satellite dna.  many robertsonian chromosomes of the mouse suppress genetic recombination near the centromere when heterozygous.  the pachytene behavior of chromosomes participating in quadrivalent formation in male mice heterozygous for t(x;4)7rl or t(x;4)8rl was analyzed in electron micrographs of microspread spermatocytes.  we predicted that species with mainly acrocentric chromosomes would be more likely to harbour b chromosomes than those with mainly bi-armed chromosomes, because female meiosis would favour more centromeres over fewer in species with one-armed chromosomes.  pachytene chromosomes of mice heterozygous for known translocations are clearly depicted by configurations of the synaptonemal complexes in spread (whole mount) preparations.  a robertsonian translocation results in a metacentric chromosome produced by the fusion of two acrocentric chromosomes.  electron microscopy of pachytene nuclei of mice heterozygous for either of two reciprocal x-7 translocations (r5 or r6) revealed a high frequency of heteromorphic bivalents involving the translocated chromosomes.  the experiments described were directed toward understanding relationships between mouse satellite dna, sister chromatid pairing, and centromere function.  robertsonian chromosomes are metacentric chromosomes formed by the joining of two telocentric chromosomes at their centromere ends.  chromosome pairing has been examined in foetal oocytes of mice heterozygous either for an x-linked inversion, in(x)1h, or an autosomal inversion, in(2)2h.  the mouse chromosome aberration xysxr  appears to challenge this assumption, for although chromosomes x and y often fail to synapse and recombine, there is no dramatic increase in aneuploid progeny.  the mouse genome contains a major and a minor satellite dna family of repetitive dna sequences.  the influence of x-autosome robertsonian (rb) translocation hemizygosity on meiotic chromosome behaviour was investigated in male mice.  this report describes our continued efforts to elucidate the genetic fine structure of the central portion of the mouse chromosome (chr) 2. ||| ",yes
Are mutations in the C9orf72  gene associated with macular degeneration?,"the hexanucleotide repeat expansion in the c9orf72 gene is the most common mutation associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (c9-als) and frontotemporal dementia (c9-ftd).  it is known seven gene mutations (abca4, elovl4, proml1, vmd2, peripherin/rds, timp3, xlrs), which may cause inherited macular dystrophies development.  the discoveries of gene variants associated with macular diseases have provided valuable insight into their molecular mechanisms, but they have not clarified why the macula is particularly vulnerable to degenerative disease.  age related macular degeneration (armd), the leading cause of blind registration in the developed world, may also have a significant genetic component to its aetiology.  because several macular dystrophies are caused by mutations in the peripherin/rds gene, we examined autosomal dominant and sporadic cases of central areolar choroidal dystrophy for mutations in the peripherin/rds gene.  to investigate whether the a69s variant of the age-related maculopathy susceptibility 2 gene (arms2) has a different hereditary contribution in neovascular age-related macular degeneration (amd) and polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (pcv).  repeat expansions in chromosome 9 open reading frame 72 (c9orf72) are an important cause of both motor neuron disease (mnd) and frontotemporal dementia (ftd).  genes implicated in monogenic macular dystrophies are good candidate susceptibility genes for armd, although to date, with the possible exception of abca4, none of these genes have been shown to confer increased risk of armd.  the 65-year-old sister of this family had the arg-142-trp mutation with no macular abnormalities, but she might still develop central areolar choroidal dystrophy at an older age.  the aim of this paper is to review current knowledge relating to the monogenic macular dystrophies, with discussion of currently mapped genes, chromosomal loci and genotype-phenotype relationships.  to evaluate the association of extramacular drusen (emd) with age-related macular degeneration (amd) and with complement factor h (cfh rs1061170) and age-related maculopathy susceptibility 2 (arms2 rs10490924) polymorphisms in individuals with and without amd.  the findings confirm that crb1 variants can be responsible for foveal retinoschisis with variable clinical expressivity ranging from schitic macular alteration to early-onset forms of cystic maculopathy.  patients harboring homozygous c.498_499insc mutations in mfrp demonstrate hyperopia, microphthalmia, retinitis pigmentosa, retinal pigment epithelial atrophy, variable degrees of foveal edema, and optic disc drusen.  until now, it is unknown which factors define whether c9orf72 mutation carriers develop als or ftd.  the complexity of the molecular basis of monogenic macular disease is now beginning to be elucidated with the identification of many of the disease-causing genes.  cystic maculopathy has been associated with genetic disorders such as retinitis pigmentosa, x-linked retinoschisis, cone dystrophy, and foveal retinoschisis.  autosomal dominant central areolar choroidal dystrophy, studied in seven families, is caused by an arg-142-trp mutation in the peripherin/rds gene.  age-related macular degeneration (amd) is a multifactorial disease with genetic and environmental factors contributing to risk.  occult macular dystrophy (omd) is an inherited macular disease characterized by progressive visual decline with the absence of visible retinal abnormalities.  macular and cone/cone-rod dystrophies (md/ccrd) demonstrate a broad genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity, with retinal alterations solely or predominantly involving the central retina. ||| ",no
Are mutations in the STXBP1 gene associated with epilepsy?,"mutations of its encoding gene, stxbp1, are among the most frequent genetic causes of epileptic encephalopathies.  mutations in stxbp1 have been associated with a series of (epileptic) neurodevelopmental disorders collectively referred to as stxbp1-encephalopathy (stxbp1-e).  the potential mechanisms explaining the variable clinical phenotypes caused by stxbp1 mutations are discussed and the designation of early-onset epileptic encephalopathies, including an updated genetic classification, is proposed to encompass the epileptic encephalopathies beginning in the first 6 months of life.  the authors describe 2 patients with early infantile epileptic encephalopathy caused by 2 novel mutations involving the stxbp1 gene.  mutations in stxbp1 have first been reported in early onset epileptic encephalopathy with suppression-bursts, then in infantile spasms and, more recently, in patients with non syndromic mental retardation without epilepsy.  to refine the phenotype associated with stxbp1 aberrations in early onset epileptic syndromes, we studied this gene in a cohort of patients with early onset epileptic encephalopathy.  stxbp1 (munc18-1) mutations have been associated with various types of epilepsies, mostly beginning early in life.  we analyzed clinical evolution and brain magnetic resonance imaging in 7 patients (6 females, 1 male) with early onset epileptic encephalopathies associated with stxbp1 mutations.  de novo stxbp1 mutations have been found in individuals with early infantile epileptic encephalopathy with suppression-burst pattern (eiee).  although the frequency of de novo mutations within stxbp1 for selective cohorts with early onset epileptic encephalopathy is more than 1%, there is no evidence for a hotspot within the gene.  conclusion: the stx1b rs140820592 may influence the risks of epilepsy and drug-resistant epilepsy by regulating stx1b expression in brain tissues.  a wide range of clinical findings have been associated with mutations in syntaxin binding protein 1 (stxbp1), including multiple forms of epilepsy, nonsyndromic intellectual disability, and movement disorders.  in this review we hypothesize about the potential of stxbp1 as a therapeutic target in the field of epileptic encephalopathies.  objective: this study aimed to explore the genetic association of stx1b snps with treatment response in patients with epilepsy in a han chinese population.  methods: we first examined the associations between stx1b snps and epilepsy in 1000 han chinese and the associations between stx1b snps and drug-resistant epilepsy in 450 subjects.  mutations within stxbp1 have been associated with a range of neurodevelopmental disorders implicating the pleotropic impact of this gene.  we found five novel stxbp1 mutations in patients for whom video-eeg recordings could be sampled from the beginning of the disease.  we studied nine currently asymptomatic adult stx1b mutation carriers with history of epilepsy and febrile seizures, who had been seizure-free for at least eight years without antiepileptic drug treatment, and ten healthy age-matched controls.  we were unable to detect any genotype-phenotype correlation, but unlike previously reported cases, most of the ddd patients with stxbp1 pathogenic variants did not present with very early-onset or severe epilepsy and encephalopathy, though all have developmental delay with intellectual disability and most display behavioral problems and suffered seizures in later childhood.  the authors suggest that in spite of the rarity of stxbp1 mutations, molecular analysis of stxbp1 gene should be performed in patients with early infantile epileptic encephalopathy, after exclusion of arx mutations in male patients and cdkl5 mutations in female patients. ||| ",yes
Are mutations in the nf1 gene associated with memory?,"mice carrying a heterozygous null mutation of the nfl gene (nfl(+/-) show important features of the learning deficits associated with nf1 (ref.  neurofibromatosis type 1 (nf1) is one of the most common single gene disorders affecting the human nervous system with a high incidence of cognitive deficits, particularly visuospatial.  neurofibromatosis type i (nf1) is one of the most common single-gene disorders that causes learning deficits in humans.  mutations of the neurofibromin gene (nf1) cause neurofibromatosis type 1 (nf1), a disease in which learning disabilities are common.  collectively, these integrative mouse and human studies reveal molecular and cellular mechanisms contributing to working memory deficits in nf1.  neurofibromatosis type 1 (nf1) is a common neurodevelopmental disorder in which affected individuals are prone to learning, attention and behavioral problems.  learning deficits also are observed in mice with a heterozygous mutation of nf1 (nf1(+/-)).  neurofibromatosis (nf1) represents the most common single gene cause of learning disabilities.  due to its well-characterized genetic etiology, investigations of nf1 may shed light on neural mechanisms underlying such difficulties in the general population or other patient groups.  neurofibromatosis type 1 (nf1) is caused by mutations in the nf1 gene.  neurofibromatosis type 1 (nf1) is caused by nf1 gene mutations.  neurofibromatosis type i (nf1) is one of the most common single-gene causes of learning disabilities.  neurofibromin gene (nf1) mutation causes neurofibromatosis type 1 (nf1), a disorder in which brain white matter deficits identified by neuroimaging are common, yet of unknown cellular etiology.  our findings have implications for the development of treatments for learning deficits associated with nf1.  neurofibromatosis type 1 (nf1) is a genetic disorder characterized inter alia by cognitive and motor dysfunction and appearance of high-signal foci on t2-weighted images in the brain.  following extended training sessions, adf1 mutants show normal early memory but defective longterm memory.  nf1 patients have impairments in frontal lobe based cognitive functions such as attention, working memory, and inhibition.  our results indicate that the learning deficits associated with nf1 may be caused by excessive ras activity, which leads to impairments in long-term potentiation caused by increased gaba-mediated inhibition.  nonspecific cognitive impairments are one of the many manifestations of neurofibromatosis type 1 (nf1).  the results of next-generation sequencing (ngs), sanger sequencing, and mlpa of nf1 gene were evaluated. ||| ",yes
Are neurexins localized at pre-synapses?,"here we report that neurexins are concentrated at synapses and that purified neuroligin is sufficient to cluster neurexin and to induce presynaptic differentiation.  neurexins are a diverse family of cell adhesion molecules that localize to presynaptic specializations of cns neurons.  these experiments suggest that neurexins are dispensable for the formation of initial synaptic contacts, but play an essential role in the stabilization and functional maturation of synapses.  neurexins are primary located on the presynaptic membrane, whereas neuroligins are strictly postsynaptic proteins.  however, the precise synaptic localization of neurexins remains enigmatic.  β-neurexins interact with numerous cell adhesion and receptor molecules, but their neuronal localization remains elusive.  moreover, we observe a large extrasynaptic pool of β-neurexins on axons and show that axonal β-neurexins diffuse with higher surface mobility than those transiently confined within synapses.  neurexins are presynaptic adhesion molecules that shape the molecular composition of synapses.  when overexpressed in nonneuronal cells, neurexins induce formation of postsynaptic specializations in cocultured neurons, suggesting that neurexins are synaptogenic.  neurexins are presynaptic adhesion molecules that organize synapses by binding to diverse trans-synaptic ligands, but how neurexins are regulated is incompletely understood.  heterologous expression of neurexins in non-neuronal cells leads to the recruitment of postsynaptic proteins in contacting dendrites of co-cultured neurons, implicating neurexins in synapse formation.  these findings suggest that the surface mobility of endogenous β-neurexins inside and outside of synapses is dynamically regulated and linked to neuronal activity.  neurexins are well-characterized presynaptic cell adhesion molecules that engage multifarious postsynaptic ligands and organize diverse synapse properties.  neurexins are presynaptic cell-adhesion molecules that form trans-synaptic complexes with postsynaptic neuroligins.  although neurexins, which are cell adhesion molecules localized predominantly to the presynaptic terminals, are known to regulate synapse formation and synaptic transmission, their roles in the regulation of synaptic vesicle release during repetitive nerve stimulation are unknown.  taken together, our results reveal an unexpected nanodomain organization of synapses in which neurexin-1 is assembled into discrete presynaptic nanoclusters that are dynamically regulated via ectodomain cleavage.  α- and β-neurexins are presynaptic cell-adhesion molecules whose general importance for synaptic transmission is well documented.  our data expand the understanding of neurexin-based transsynaptic interaction networks by providing further insight into the interactions nucleated by neurexins at the synapse.  interactions between presynaptic neurexins and postsynaptic neuroligins coordinate the formation of synaptic adhesions.  neurexins are a large family of neuronal plasma membrane proteins, which function as trans-synaptic receptors during synaptic differentiation. ||| ",yes
Are nucleosomes positioned at DNA replication origins?,"together our data provide a comprehensive, genome-wide view of chromatin structure at replication origins and suggest a model of nucleosome positioning at replication origins in which the underlying sequence occludes nucleosomes to permit binding of the origin recognition complex, which then (likely in concert with nucleosome modifiers and remodelers) positions nucleosomes adjacent to the origin to promote replication origin function.  on average, replication origins contain a nucleosome depleted region centered next to the acs element, flanked on both sides by arrays of well-positioned nucleosomes.  the availability of genome-wide maps of nucleosome positions has led to an explosion of information about how nucleosomes are assembled at transcription start sites, but no similar maps exist for dna replication origins.  positioning of nucleosomes regulates the access of dna binding factors to their consensus sequences.  our analysis identified dna sequence properties that correlate with nucleosome occupancy at replication origins genome-wide and that are correlated with the nucleosome-depleted region.  here we combine high-resolution genome-wide nucleosome maps with comprehensive annotations of dna replication origins to identify patterns of nucleosome occupancy at eukaryotic replication origins.  nucleosomal organization influenced two steps of replication initiation: origin licensing and helicase activation.  the key genetic process of dna replication is initiated at specific sites referred to as replication origins.  our studies show nucleosomes directly modulate origin licensing and activation through distinct mechanisms and provide insights into the regulation of replication initiation by chromatin.  foci in different regions of the nucleus initiate replication at different times of s-phase, suggesting nuclear position may contribute to where and when replication begins.  we provide evidence that the origin recognition complex, which binds to the origin, acts as a barrier element to position and phase nucleosomes on both sides of the origin.  these findings provide novel molecular insight into the mechanisms that govern dynamics and spatial organization of dna replication origins and possibly other functional dna elements.  chromosomal dna replication is proposed to occur in special compartments in the nucleus called replication foci.  the results of three-dimensional confocal microscopy indicate that chorion dna replication origins are highly active in diverse positions within the nucleus.  using reconstituted nucleosomal dna replication assays, we assessed the impact of nucleosomes on replication initiation.  recently, nucleosome-nucleosome interactions were suggested as one of the factors underlying preferential nucleosomes positioning.  we also find that chorion replication origins inserted at ectopic chromosomal sites can amplify highly in diverse nuclear locations distinct from the endogenous loci, including when they are buffered against genomic position effects.  in s. cerevisiae, replication origins occupy characteristic subnuclear localizations that anticipate their initiation timing during s phase.  a key to understanding the exact features of chromatin that impinge on replication origin function is to define the precise locations of the dna sequences that control origin function.  clustering analysis of all annotated replication origins revealed a surprising diversity of nucleosome occupancy patterns. ||| ",no
Are optogenetics tools used in the study and treatment of epilepsy?,"this review discusses recent breakthroughs made with optogenetics in epilepsy research.  this chapter focuses on the development of optogenetics and on-demand technologies for the study of epilepsy and the control of seizures.  we then turn to the use of optogenetics, including on-demand optogenetics in the study of epilepsies, which highlights the powerful potential of optogenetics for epilepsy research.  optogenetic approaches may treat drug-refractory epilepsies.  several groups have reported that optogenetic approaches successfully attenuated epileptiform activity in different rodent models of epilepsy, providing proof of the principle that this approach may translate to an effective treatment for epilepsy patients.  optogenetics has potential applications in the study of epilepsy and neuroprostheses, and for studies on neural circuit dynamics.  the recent development of optogenetics, because of its unprecedented precision for controlling activity within distinct neuronal populations, has revolutionized neuroscience, including epilepsy research.  optogenetic techniques provide powerful tools for bidirectional control of neuronal activity and investigating alterations occurring in excitability disorders, such as epilepsy.  optogenetic techniques have been widely used in the study of neuropsychiatric diseases such as anxiety, depression, and drug addiction.  alternative treatments for drug-resistant epilepsy such as vagal, cortical or subcortical stimulation, focal cooling, callosotomy, or ketogenic diet have met with limited success, whereas optogenetic approaches have shown considerable pre-clinical promise.  the use of optogenetics to activate or inhibit neurons is an important toolbox for neuroscientists.  the recent development of optogenetics, a revolutionary research tool in neuroscience, portends an evolution of current clinical neuromodulation tools.  optogenetics is a modern neuroscience research tool that allows precise spatiotemporal control of defined cells and circuits and, thus, dissection of critical players and targeting them for responsive treatments.  we chose to explore a conceptually novel strategy involving simultaneous activation of mixed populations of interneurons by optogenetics and study their impact on ongoing epileptiform activity in mouse acute hippocampal slices.  the field of optogenetics has been successfully used to understand the mechanisms of neuropsychiatric diseases through the precise spatial and temporal control of specific groups of neurons in a neural circuitry.  optogenetics has a lot of potential to become an effective neuromodulative therapy for clinical applications.  our data suggest that global optogenetic activation of mixed interneuron populations is a more effective approach for development of novel therapeutic strategies for epilepsy, but the initial action potential generation in principal neurons needs to be taken in consideration.  several optogenetic devices are in use.  optogenetics is currently the state-of-the-art method for causal-oriented brain research.  recent technological advances open exciting avenues for improving the understanding of mechanisms in a broad range of epilepsies. ||| ",yes
Are organisms in the genus Morexella associated with sepsis?,"moraxella is one of the very rare causes of septic arthritis.  gram-negative bacteremia has been associated with severe sepsis, although the exact mechanism and pathophysiological differences among bacterial species are not well understood.  we hereby present the third case of moraxella nonliquefaciens septic arthritis and the first case in a hematopoietic stem cell transplant patient (hsct) along with a brief review of the literature.  infectious arthritis with moraxella spp.  these observations suggest a distinct immunopathophysiologic behavior of sepsis in patients with gram-negative bacteremia that may influence clinical outcomes.  the streptococcus milleri group are becoming increasingly recognized as important pulmonary pathogens which may lead to the development of empyema or lung abscesses.  we used pubmed with google search engine to search the literature for reported cases of moraxella septic arthritis.  previous studies have suggested that the lipopolysaccharide (lps, endotoxin) component of the gram-negative bacterial cell wall is a key virulence factor that serves to enhance mortality during infections in which fungi and gram-negative bacteria are copathogens.  a patient with x-linked (bruton's) agammaglobulinemia was found to have persistent sepsis with a helicobacter-like organism despite multiple courses of antibiotics.  we conclude that the streptococcus milleri group is a more important cause of pulmonary infections than has been previously recognized.  in the previous issue of critical care, abe and colleagues report results of a retrospective study that show a significantly higher incidence of gram-negative bacteremia among adult intensive care unit patients with septic shock than in those with sepsis or severe sepsis.  information on 19 other cases of moraxella infectious arthritis was found.  septic arthritis is a common rheumatologic condition with myriad microbiological causative agents.  to better characterize the microbial determinants of rapid death from infection both in vitro and in vivo studies were performed to compare a clinical strain of c. sordellii (da-108), isolated from a patient who survived a disseminated infection unaccompanied by toxic shock syndrome, to a virulent reference strain (atcc9714).  in adjusted analyses, s. aureus was associated with a 20% higher risk of death both during the in-hospital period and the 12-week post-discharge period, when compared with all other specified organisms.  the relative contribution of the host and bacteria to e. coli bacteremia severity remains unknown.  however, supernatant from tcsl+, sdl- strains demonstrated a lower ld50 relative to tcsl-, sdl+ strains, suggesting the potential for severe c. sordellii-associated disease may be determined by the particular strain colonizing the host.  intratracheal inoculation of 1.0 × 108 cfu live s. haemolyticus caused macroscopic and histological confluent pneumonia with significant increase in bal white cell count, tumor necrosis factor-α (tnf-α), and macrophage inflammatory protein (mip)-2.  herein, we provide data suggesting the potential for severe c. sordellii-associated disease may be dictated by whether the specific strain produces lethal toxin (tcsl) or sordellilysin (sdl), a cholesterol-dependent cytolysin.  the inoculation of 1.0 × 106 and 1.0 × 107 cfu live s. haemolyticus caused histologic interstitial pneumonia and moderate bal inflammation. ||| ",yes
Are osteoclasts specialized in bone degradation?,"osteoclasts, specialized cells that degrade bone, are key components of the cellular system that regulates and maintains bone homeostasis.  osteoclasts have a unique bone-destroying capacity, playing key roles in steady-state bone remodeling and arthritic bone erosion.  osteoclasts are multinuclear cells that degrade bone under both physiological and pathophysiological conditions.  osteoclasts are multinucleated cells specialized in degrading bone and characterized by high expression of the enzymes tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (trap) and cathepsin k (ctsk).  osteoclasts are unique cells that resorb bone, and are involved in not only bone remodeling but also pathological bone loss such as osteoporosis and rheumatoid arthritis.  osteoclasts are bone-specific multinucleated cells generated by differentiation of monocyte/macrophage hematopoietic lineages and degrade bone matrix by secretion of lytic enzymes.  osteoclasts are highly specialized cells that resorb bone and contribute to bone remodeling.  osteoclasts are large, mobile, bone-resorbing cells and play a critical role in bone remodeling and catabolic bone diseases.  the major function of osteoclasts is to hydrolyze inorganic hydroxyapatite and degrade organic bone matrix, mainly collagen.  the multinucleated osteoclast has a unique function: degradation of mineralized tissues.  osteoclasts are the exclusive cells of bone resorption.  as the only cells capable of efficiently resorbing bone, osteoclasts are central mediators of both normal bone remodeling and pathologies associates with excessive bone resorption.  osteoclasts are bone-resorbing cells essential for skeletal remodeling and regeneration.  osteoclasts, the bone resorbing cells, play a key role both in normal bone remodeling and in the skeletal osteopenia of arthritis, osteoporosis, periodontal disease and certain malignancies.  osteoclasts (ocs) are important cells that are involved in the regulation of bone metabolism and are mainly responsible for coordinating bone resorption with bone formation to regulate bone remodeling.  several studies have now described the molecular mechanisms by which osteoblasts control osteoclastogenesis and bone degradation.  we studied the effect of osteoblast conditioned medium on bone degradation by multinucleated osteoclast-like cells generated in vitro from mononuclear precursors and found that the medium stimulates bone degradation primarily through interactions with osteoclast precursors.  osteoclasts are therefore a major target of osteoporosis therapeutics aimed at preserving bone.  osteoclasts, the only cells with bone resorption functions in vivo, maintain the balance of bone metabolism by cooperating with osteoblasts, which are responsible for bone formation.  osteoclasts are multinucleated, bone-resorbing cells. ||| ",yes
Are paralog genes co-regulated?,"we hypothesize that paralogs share common regulatory mechanisms to enable coordinated expression according to tads.  consequently, paralogs show correlation in gene expression whereby the mechanisms of co-regulation remain unclear.  combined, our results indicate that paralogs share common regulatory mechanisms and cluster not only in the linear genome but also in the three-dimensional chromatin architecture.  paralogs are genes that most probably share duplication history and show a significant similarity in their sequences, even if they perform slightly different biological function.  strikingly, half the surveyed paralog pairs were found to be co-clustered in protein complexes, and were more conserved and highly expressed than non-co-clustered paralogs; however, their discordant expression patterns and conservation rates indicate differential regulation of subfunctionalized paralogs.  duplicate genes of this form are called paralogs and such genes share a high degree sequence similarity as well as often having closely related functions.  many genomes contain families of paralogs--proteins with divergent function that evolved from a common ancestral gene after a duplication event.  paralogous genes are genes which descend from a progenitor gene which has duplicated as an ancestral gene, each copy having diverged prior to speciation.  paralog genes arise from gene duplication events during evolution, which often lead to similar proteins that cooperate in common pathways and in protein complexes.  we show that paralog gene pairs are enriched for co-localization in the same tad, share more often common enhancer elements than expected and have increased contact frequencies over large genomic distances.  however, individual paralogs can confer vastly different effects upon cellular processes, e.g., specific yeast paralogs regulate actin organization, bud site selection, and mrna localization, although how specificity is conferred is unknown.  this enables concerted expression of paralogs over diverse cell-types and indicate evolutionary constraints in functional genome organization.  they have led to the constitution of subfamilies of paralogous genes.  homologous genes are classified into orthologs and paralogs, depending on whether they arose by speciation or duplication.  by comparison to vertebrate parahox gene regulation we explore the evolutionary implications.  this implies that each gene in a species does not always have an ortholog in another species and thus, due to multiple duplication events following a speciation, many orthologous clades of paralogs are generated.  genomes can be described as a collection of clusters, the gene families, whose members are called paralogs.  paralogous proteins play a vital role in evolutionary adaptation of organisms and species divergence.  chromosomal regions that contain present-day paralogs (paralogous regions or paralogons) have been identified in mammals.  the reason is that most families contain paralogs, i.e., more than one homologous sequence per species. ||| ",yes
Are patients with Sjogren syndrome at increased risk for lymphoma?,"patients with sjögren's syndrome (ss) have a considerable higher risk of lymphoma development.  patients with sjögren's syndrome (ss) have an increased risk of developing malignant lymphoma.  an increased risk of developing lymphoma has been indicated in sjögren's syndrome (ss), and the lymphomas in ss are usually b-cell type in origin.  sjögren's syndrome is an autoimmune disorder in which patients have a well-recognized risk of developing malignant lymphoma.  sjogren's syndrome (ss) is characterized by an increased risk of developing non-hodgkin's lymphoma (nhl).  sjögren's syndrome (ss) is characterized by an increased risk of developing a non-hodgkin's lymphoma (nhl).  primary sjögren's syndrome (pss) is associated with increased risk of lymphoproliferative malignancy, and b-cell non-hodgkin lymphoma (b-nhl) is the most frequent type.  it has been recognized that primary sjogren's syndrome predisposes to the development of lymphoproliferative disorders.  primary sjogren's syndrome (pss) is complicated by b-cell lymphoma in 5-10% of patients.  patients with primary sjögren's syndrome (pss) are at a higher risk of developing non-hodgkin's lymphoma (nhl).  the frequent association of sjögren's syndrome (ss) with non-hodgkin's b cell lymphoma (nhl) provides an example of the interplay of systemic autoimmunity and lymphoproliferative diseases, and an opportunity to study the pathogenetic steps of lymphomagenesis.  the purpose of the study was to detect cases of sjögren's syndrome among newly diagnosed untreated patients with non-hodgkin's lymphoma and, furthermore, to identify in such cases clinical and serologic features known to occur more frequently in sjögren's syndrome patients who evolve into lymphoma.  patients with primary sjögren's syndrome (pss) have an increased risk of developing non-hodgkin's lymphoma (nhl), particularly parotid gland mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (malt) lymphomas.  patients with sjögren's syndrome (ss) have an increased risk of developing monoclonal b cell non-hodgkin's lymphomas (mnhl), which frequently occur in the salivary glands (sg).  sjogren's syndrome was commonly identified in the patients with t-cell lgl leukemia in this study.  these results suggest that monoclonal immunoglobulin heavy chain gene rearrangements are a relatively common finding in patients with sjögren's syndrome and may prove to be a useful marker for predicting the progression to, and early detection of malignant lymphoma.  herein we report two cases of primary sjogren's syndrome complicated by breast and lung cancer and who have a strong family history for lymphoproliferative diseases.  primary sjögren's syndrome (pss) is a chronic systemic autoimmune disease with an elevated risk of developing lymphoproliferative malignancies (lm).  we set to determine the prevalence of sjogren's syndrome in lgl leukemia and its cytokine profile.  although our sample is relatively small, our results confirm the relationship between sjögren's syndrome and non-hodgkin's lymphoma, looked at from the opposite direction. ||| ",yes
Are patients with marfan syndrome at increased risk of arrhythmias?,"this study examines the prevalence of arrhythmias in children with the mfs and their relation to clinical and/or echocardiographic factors.  patients with the marfan syndrome (mfs) are at risk for sudden death.  mitral valve disease (mvd)-associated atrial fibrillation (af) is one of the most common arrhythmias with an increased risk of thromboembolic events.  it is controversial whether scn5a mutation carriers possess a greater risk of major arrhythmic events (mae).  the high incidence of arrhythmias in patients with heart failure, hypertension, valvular heart disease, or mitral walve prolapse suggests a strong link between wall motion abnormalities and arrhythmias.  mitral valve prolapse has been associated with increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias.  brugada syndrome (brs) is an inherited arrhythmic disease associated with an increased risk of major arrhythmic events (mae).  this study evaluated the incidence of significant arrhythmias in a series of patients with fabry cardiomyopathy.  we investigated the role of phenotypic characteristics in stratifying the risk of sustained ventricular arrhythmias in patients harboring arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia/cardiomyopathy-associated mutations.  microvolt t-wave alternans (mtwa) has been associated with malignant ventricular arrhythmias in patients (pts) with structural heart disease.  patients with arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia/cardiomyopathy (arvd/c) carry the risk of ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death (scd).  the mitral valve prolapse syndrome is associated with a variety of atrial and ventricular arrhythmias.  arrhythmias are important causes of morbidity and mortality in fabry cardiomyopathy.  prior studies suggest that the incidence of ventricular arrhythmias is high in patients with fabry cardiomyopathy.  using multivariate analysis the occurrence of arrhythmia significantly correlated with the presence of coexisting heart disease (p< 0.001) and age at surgery (p=0.011) after surgery sustained supraventricular arrhythmias were recorded in 16 patients (11.7%).  atrial fibrillation (af) is the most common arrhythmia, and it is strongly related to atrial enlargement.  mtwa has been shown to be a strong heart rate-dependent arrhythmia marker.  female gender, more symmetric bileaflet prolapse on tte, and the presence of papillary muscle lge on cmr may be associated with papillary muscle origin of ventricular arrhythmias in patients with mitral valve prolapse.  pedigree evaluation, an ecg, and a holter examination provide for comprehensive arrhythmic risk stratification in patients with arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia/cardiomyopathy-associated mutations.  introduction atrial fibrillation and mitral stenosis, especially in combination, increase the risk of left atrial thrombus formation and systemic embolization. ||| ",yes
Are people with blood group O protected against severe Malaria?,"blood group o protects african children against severe malaria and has reached high prevalence in malarious regions.  the present study shows a clear protective effect of blood group o against malaria in primiparae.  this may give blood group o individuals a survival advantage over the other groups in complicated malaria as suggested.  individuals with blood group ""a"" have been found to be highly susceptible to falciparum malaria whereas blood group ""o"" is said to confer protection against complicated cases.  blood group o has been significantly associated with increased placental malaria infection in primiparae and reduced risk of infection in multiparae in the gambia, an area with markedly seasonal malaria transmission.  studies in various populations consistently demonstrate that blood group 'o' confers resistance against severe falciparum infection.  recent epidemiological evidences revealed the higher prevalence of 'o' blood group in the residents of malaria-endemic areas.  individuals with blood group ""a"" were about four times at risk of malaria as compared to individuals with blood group ""o"" (aor= 3.74).  these data provide the first evidence that abo blood group antigens influence macrophage clearance of p. falciparum-infected erythrocytes and suggest an additional mechanism by which blood group o may confer resistance to severe malaria.  there is a predominance of blood group o in malaria-endemic regions, and several lines of evidence suggest that abo blood groups may influence the outcome of p. falciparum infection.  results of the current study indicate that blood group 'o' is associated with reduced and 'b' blood group with increased risk of development of severe malaria in odisha, india.  recent epidemiological evidences revealed a higher rate of o blood group in the residents of malaria-endemic areas suggesting that groups a, b, and ab associated with a higher disease severity and fatality.  meta-analysis of previous studies, including the current one, highlighted the protective nature of blood group 'o' to severe malaria (p = 0.01).  for plasmodium falciparum related malaria (b50), one of the outstanding host factors for the development of severe disease is the abo blood group of malaria patients, where blood group o reduces the probability of severe disease as compared to individuals of groups a, b, or ab.  prevalence of 'o' group in uncomplicated malaria (p < 0.0001; or = 2.81) and healthy controls (p = 0.0003; or = 2.16) was significantly high compared to severe malaria.  the abo blood group influences susceptibility to severe plasmodium falciparum malaria.  these findings suggest that the combined anti-malarial protective roles of sct and blood group-o have synergistic effects in reducing the risks of ebl.  notably, the abo blood group of a malaria patient determines the development of the disease given that blood group o reduces the probability to succumb in severe malaria, compared to individuals of groups a, b or ab.  association between blood group a and decreased risk of severe malaria was significant.  meta-analysis also supports the protective nature of blood group 'o' from severe falciparum infection. ||| ",yes
Are piRNAs involved in gene silencing?,"small silencing rnas, including micrornas, endogenous small interfering rnas (endo-sirnas) and piwi-interacting rnas (pirnas), have been shown to play important roles in fine-tuning gene expression, defending virus and controlling transposons.  piwi-interacting rnas (pirnas) are germline-specific, small silencing rnas that suppress te activity and maintain genome integrity during germline development.  small interfering rnas (sirnas) and micrornas (mirnas) are key regulators of posttranscriptional gene silencing, which is referred to as rna interference (rnai) or rna silencing.  rna interference pathways use small rnas to mediate gene silencing in eukaryotes.  piwi-interacting rnas (pirnas) are the small non-coding rnas (ncrnas) that silence genomic transposable elements.  small silencing rnas--small interfering rnas (sirnas) or micrornas (mirnas)--direct posttranscriptional gene silencing of their mrna targets as guides for the rna-induced silencing complex (risc).  small rnas, including small interfering rnas (sirnas), micrornas (mirnas) and piwi-associated interfering rnas (pirnas), are powerful gene expression regulators.  rna interference (rnai) or post-transcriptional gene silencing is a strong mechanism of gene silencing which is moderated by micrornas (mirnas), underlying many fields of eukaryotic biology.  rna silencing refers to a series of nuclear and cytoplasmatic processes involved in the post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression or post-transcriptional gene silencing (ptgs), either by sequence-specific mrna degradation or by translational arrest.  rna silencing also plays an important role in the control of development.  and researchers found out that pirna also regulates various endogenous transcripts.  the piwi-pirna complexes are then transported into the nucleus to exert te silencing.  rna silencing pathways are now recognized to participate in essential cellular functions ranging from the regulation of mrna turnover to the suppression of the activity of potentially deleterious transposable elements (tes).  the best characterized small rnas are micrornas (mirnas), which predominantly perform gene silencing through post-transcriptional mechanisms.  the piwi-interacting rnas (pirnas) represent a germline-specific small rna pathway where piwi proteins themselves are thought to mediate pirna biosynthesis.  in plants, rna silencing serves as a potent antiviral defense system.  loss of small silencing rnas or components in their pathways often leads to severe developmental defects, including lethality and sterility.  small rnas exert an effect through diverse rna interference pathways to transcriptionally or post-transcriptionally silence their targets.  by directing the rna-induced silencing complex (risc) to bind specific target mrnas, mirna can repress target genes and affect various biological phenotypes.  in rnai, sirna loaded onto the rna-induced silencing complex (risc) downreugulates target gene expression by cleaving mrna whose sequence is perfectly complementary to the sirna guide strand. ||| ",yes
Are proteasome inhibitors good candidates for treatment of leukemia and solid tumors?,"proteasome inhibitors have been approved in clinical use against hematologic malignancies, but their application in solid tumors is uncertain.  proteasome inhibitors have been suggested as potential anticancer agents in many clinical trials.  although proteasome inhibitors have been most successfully applied in the treatment of hematological malignancies, they also received continuing interest for the treatment of solid tumors.  proteasome inhibitors have demonstrated promise in vitro, and as a result clinical trials have begun to investigate these agents as therapy for numerous human cancers.  while several proteasome inhibitors have been successfully approved by the food and drug administration for the treatment of hematological malignancies, the clinical efficacy of these inhibitors is unexpectedly lower in the treatment of solid tumors due to the functional and structural heterogeneity of proteasomes in solid tumors.  proteasome inhibitors are effective agents against multiple myeloma and mantle cell lymphoma and display great potential as treatment for a variety of other malignancies.  in this review, we summarize the current positioning of proteasome inhibitors in the treatment of common solid malignancies (e.g., lung, colon, pancreas, breast, and head and neck cancer), addressing topics of their mechanism(s) of action, predictive factors and molecular mechanisms of resistance.  there are ongoing trials to examine the effectiveness of compound and novel proteasome inhibitors that can target solid tumors either alone or in combination with conventional chemotherapeutic agents.  the clinical successes of proteasome inhibitors for the treatment of cancer have highlighted the therapeutic potential of targeting this protein degradation system.  growing evidence from translational research and clinical trials proved the effectiveness of proteasome inhibitors (pis) in treating several types of hematological malignancies.  proteasome inhibitors represent a novel class of drugs that have clinical efficacy against hematological and solid cancer types, including acute myeloid leukaemia, myelodysplastic syndrome an non-small cell lung cancer.  in preclinical studies, proteasome inhibitors (pis) induced apoptosis and inhibited tumor growth, supporting their potential role in the treatment of various tumor types, especially hematologic malignancies.  the proteasome is emerging as a target for cancer therapy because small molecule inhibitors of its catalytic activity induce apoptosis in both in vitro and in vivo models of human malignancies and are proving to have efficacy in early clinical trials.  the inhibitors of proteasomes have recently been shown to induce apoptosis of tumor cells in vitro and to exert significant antitumor effects in murine tumor models in vivo.  cancer cells are particularly sensitive to proteasome inhibitors, indicating the utility for inhibition of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway as an approach for cancer therapy.  the cellular proteasome is an important molecular target in cancer therapy and drug resistance research.  proteasome inhibitors display potent anti-neoplastic and anti-angiogenic properties both in vitro and in vivo.  inhibition of the proteasome, the multicatalytic protease complex responsible for the turnover of many cellular proteins, represents an attractive target in the development of new drug therapies, proteasome inhibitors being potentially useful tools for the treatment of pathologies such as cancer, as well as inflammatory, immune and neurodegenerative diseases.  this review explores new information about how the proteasome regulates apoptosis and how proteasome inhibitors can be exploited as anti-tumor drugs.  our developed techniques and generated results will serve as a valuable guideline for investigators developing a new generation of proteasome inhibitors as an effective targeted therapy for solid tumors. ||| ",yes
Are psammoma bodies characteristic to meningiomas?,"the fine structure of psammoma bodies was examined in four cases of fibroblastic meningioma.  we report a case of psammomatous meningioma in which meningothelial cells and psammoma bodies were both abundant and diffuse, allowing for the diagnosis of a meningioma.  to demonstrate that psammoma bodies in human meningiomas contain type vi collagen and laminin.  meningiomas often contain concentric calcified foci, referred to as psammoma bodies.  we examined psammoma bodies at the ultrastructural level within meningocytic whorls in nine cases of meningioma.  seven cases of meningiomas with ""pseudopsammoma bodies"" have previously been described in the literature.  this is the first report to describe the involvement of type vi collagen in psammoma bodies and whorl formations in meningiomas.  psammoma bodies are laminated, calcified spherites, commonly associated with meningiomas, ovarian serous cystadenocarcinomas, and papillary carcinoma of the thyroid.  it is concluded that meningotheliomatous meningiomas with ""pseudopsammoma bodies"" are mixed tumours, including a non-meningotheliomatous component, the origin and significance of which is uncertain.  the fna smear showed the spindle-shaped cells in concentric whorls and scattered psammoma bodies that are characteristic of meningioma.  two cases of primary extracranial meningioma of the psammomatous variant are reported here.  a case of right frontal sinus tumor which at histology turned out to be a psammomatous meningioma is reported.  the presence of meningothelial elements along with abundant psammoma bodies indicates the presence of a benign meningioma within a teratoma.  because the morphology and components of psammoma bodies in papillary carcinoma of the thyroid are similar to those of psammoma bodies in meningioma, we examined whether opn was related to the psammoma bodies in papillary carcinoma of the thyroid.  electron microscopy of the cells surrounding the ""pseudopsammoma bodies"" reveals an ultrastructure different from that of the meningotheliomatous cells.  we report a case of a psammomatous variant of meningioma arising in a pure and mature testicular teratoma.  these findings suggest that both matrix giant bodies and matrix vesicles may serve as initial nidus of calcification of psammoma bodies in fibroblastic meningioma.  recently, histogenetic and phenotypic similarities between meningiomas and mesotheliomas have been proposed.  in meningioma with pseudopsammoma bodies, igg was secreted from tumour cells which differentiated to secretory epithelial cells, and was found to deposit in the pseudopsammoma bodies.  the present result suggests that opn produced by cd68-positive macrophages may play a significant role for development of psammoma bodies in meningiomas. ||| ",yes
Are pseudogenes enriched with housekeeping protein families?,"pseudogenes, the nonfunctional homologues of functional genes are now coming to light as important resources regarding the study of human protein evolution.  the human genes configuring pseudogenes are also now coming forth as important resources in the study of human protein evolution.  although often presumed to lack function, growing numbers of pseudogenes are being found to play important biological roles.  pseudogenes are commonly encountered during investigation of the genomes of a wide range of life forms.  in this study, focusing on human pseudogenes and their functional homologues we describe their characteristic features and relevance to protein sequence evolution.  pseudogenes, regarded as 'genomic fossils', are dna sequences resembling functional genes in perspective of sequence homology but completely non-functional.  pseudogenes are important resources in understanding the evolutionary history of genes and genomes.  although pseudogenes were reported to exist in the genomes of many eukaryotes and bacteria, no systematic search for pseudogenes in the escherichia coli genome has been carried out.  pseudogenes.  during the last few years, the study of pseudogenes has excited enthusiasm, because it has been proven that at least some of them are involved in important biological processes.  we suggest that pseudogenes constitute a small fraction of the genomes of free-living bacteria in general, reflecting the faster elimination than production of pseudogenes.  researches on the progenitors of human processed pseudogenes delved out their highly expressed and evolutionarily conserved characters.  in this study, we characterized human processed pseudogenes in terms of evolutionary dynamics.  in consideration of their evolutionary origins and inherent limitations in genome annotation practices, we posit that pseudogenes have been classified on a scientifically unsubstantiated basis.  pseudogenes are abundant in the human genome and had long been thought of purely as nonfunctional gene fossils.  the discovery that pseudogenes are involved in important biological processes has excited enthusiasm and increased the research interest on them.  our results indicate that the generation of processed pseudogenes was not wholly futile but instead has been an indispensable resource, driving dynamic evolution of the mammalian genomes.  this review concentrates on vertebrate, and in particular mammalian, pseudogenes and describes their origin and subsequent evolution.  despite the wide distribution of processed pseudogenes in mammalian genomes, such as those of human and mouse, relatively little is known about their roles in genomic evolution.  recently, whole-genome computational approaches have revealed thousands of pseudogenes in the genomes of the human and other eukaryotes. ||| ",yes
Are reduced-nicotine cigarettes effective for smoking cessation?,"we reviewed the available literature on the use of reduced-nicotine content cigarettes as a cessation aid.  evidence from a number of small smoking cessation studies suggests that the use of cigarettes with reduced nicotine content, in combination with nicotine replacement therapy (nrt), may help reduce withdrawal symptoms and increase quit rates.  maximising nicotine reduction may facilitate smoking cessation.  reducing the nicotine content of cigarettes is a potential regulatory strategy that may enable cessation.  smoking cigarettes with substantially lower nicotine than conventional cigarettes prior to a quit attempt may reduce the reinforcing effects of smoking, which could facilitate smoking cessation through extinction learning.  reducing cigarette nicotine content to nonaddictive levels facilitates smoking cessation; however, very low nicotine content cigarettes (vlncs) may not be equally effective across heterogeneous smokers.  one such approach is the use of cigarettes with reduced nicotine content.  the data reviewed in this commentary suggest that abrupt reduction in the level of nicotine in combustible cigarettes could reduce smoking behavior, nicotine dependence, and other related constructs and increase quit attempts and eventual smoking cessation.  there appears to be moderate evidence that use of reduced nicotine cigarettes (rnc) increases the likelihood of making a quit attempt among smokers unmotivated to quit and among smokers motivated to quit who also used nicotine replacement therapy (nrt).  reduced nicotine content (rnc) cigarettes have led to smoking fewer cigarettes, withdrawal relief, and facilitation of cessation.  cigarettes with selective reductions in nicotine delivery have been considered as potential tools to prevent or treat nicotine dependence or to reduce harm by virtue of reduced nicotine and nitrosamine delivery.  one case series study and trial data indicate that reduction in the level of nicotine in cigarette tobacco can reduce the level of nicotine dependence in smokers and do so without adverse effects on cardiovascular biomarkers or significant compensatory smoking.  the present study investigated the effect of nicotine exposure while smoking very low nicotine content (vlnc) cigarettes on cessation outcomes.  the moderate evidence that abrupt reduction in nicotine reduces self-reported dependence as well as smoking behavior and likelihood of relapse is also reviewed.  reduction in cigarettes per day (cpd) aided by nicotine replacement therapy (nrt) increases cessation in smokers; however, it is unclear whether this is due to use of nrt or reduction per se.  these findings may have implications for smoking cessation treatment or a policy measure to reduce nicotine content in cigarettes.  a reduction in the nicotine content of cigarettes to non-addictive levels is being considered as a regulatory strategy for reducing tobacco dependence in the united states.  this paper describes the development of a smoking cessation intervention designed to optimize extinction processes using reduced nicotine cigarettes, as well as the design and methods for an ongoing randomized controlled trial (rct) to evaluate this intervention.  in smokers not interested in quitting, reducing the nicotine content in cigarettes over 12 months does not appear to result in extinction of nicotine dependence, assessed by persistently reduced nicotine intake or quitting smoking over the subsequent 12 months.  evidence suggests that reducing the nicotine concentration in cigarettes to sub-addictive levels would reduce use. ||| ",yes
Are retroviruses used for gene therapy?,"recombinant retroviruses are currently used as gene delivery vehicles for the purpose of gene therapy.  recombinant retroviruses are widely used for gene transfer into eukaryotic cells and exhibit significant potential for human gene therapy.  currently, a variety of retroviruses that provide distinct advantages for gene delivery has been modified and used in clinical trials.  retroviruses are used for a variety of applications requiring the delivery of exogenous genes to cells and animals.  recombinant retroviruses are a common vehicle to deliver an exogenous gene to a target cell, which makes them a useful tool in the field of gene therapy.  recombinant retroviruses are by far the most frequently used vehicle in clinical gene therapy.  several viral and physicochemical vehicles have been used for the transfer of genes to mammalian cells, but recombinant retroviruses are used in the majority of gene therapy clinical trials today.  retroviruses, adenoviruses, poxviruses, adeno-associated virus, herpesviruses, and others are being engineered to serve as gene therapy vectors and are being administered to patients in a clinical setting.  the ability to target the delivery and expression of therapeutic genes in vivo using retroviral vectors is a prerequisite for widespread and routine use in the clinic and will be of great importance for the safe and successful treatment of certain genetic disorders as well as tumors and viral infections.  retroviral vectors are one of the most promising vehicles for the delivery of therapeutic genes in human gene therapy protocols.  retroviruses are ideal tools for gene transfer into dividing cells both in vitro and in vivo, which has led to their expanding use in developing systems.  gene transfer vectors derived from gamma-retroviruses or lentiviruses are currently used for the gene therapy of genetic or acquired diseases.  processes for large-scale manufacturing of recombinant retroviruses that can produce high gene transfer efficiencies will have significant impact on the clinical implementation of gene therapy.  various modifications have been made to retroviral-based vectors and helper cells to alter gene expression, target delivery, improve viral titers, and increase safety.  retrovirus-derived gene transfer systems (retroviral vectors) are the most commonly used gene transfer tools in modern biology.  as with any delivery tool, the efficiency, the ability to target certain tissue or cell type, the expression of the gene of interest, and the safety of retroviral-based systems are important for successful application of gene therapy.  gene transfer vectors based on retroviridae are increasingly becoming a tool of choice for biomedical research and for the development of biotherapies in rare diseases or cancers.  the use of retroviral vectors (rvs) derived from the murine oncoretroviruses for gene therapy is associated with the risk of malignant transformation of infected cells and ectopic expression of the proteins of interest.  retroviruses and adenoviruses are among the most commonly used viral vectors in trials.  highly oncogenic retroviruses served as a model for the construction of artificial retroviral gene transfer systems. ||| ",yes
Are seizures among the neurological symptoms of incontinentia pigmenti?,"some children with incontinentia pigmenti exhibit encephalopathic features with severe seizures and disturbed consciousness, from the neonatal through the early infantile period.  a 2-month-old girl with incontinentia pigmenti presented with acute-onset right-handed focalized seizures and subsequent seizure generalization.  incontinentia pigmenti is a rare neurocutaneous disorder that may result in neurological symptoms in addition to its characteristic skin rashes.  a 15-day-old girl with incontinentia pigmenti experienced neurological symptoms such as decreased level of consciousness and a weak sucking reflex.  incontinentia pigmenti is an x-linked dominant neurocutaneous disorder with central nervous system manifestations in 30% of cases, including seizures and mental retardation.  we review the literature and discuss the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of acute central nervous system disorders in incontinentia pigmenti.  incontinentia pigmenti is a rare x-linked neurocutaneous disorder that can present in the neonatal period with seizures and encephalopathy.  we describe a neonate with the typical rash of incontinentia pigmenti along with seizures and brain magnetic resonance imaging abnormalities.  despite extensive cerebral arteriopathy in association with incontinentia pigmenti, this girl had a relatively stable early clinical course, steady developmental progress over time, and seizures that have been well controlled.  we report a neonate with acute neurological symptoms of incontinentia pigmenti who was effectively treated with corticosteroid therapy.  the pathogenesis of central nervous system disorders in incontinentia pigmenti remains unclear, but it has been suggested that vascular abnormalities and inflammatory processes may play important roles.  we describe a patient with incontinentia pigmenti who developed bilateral cerebrovascular accidents in the neonatal period, with resultant severe neurologic sequelae.  these findings suggest that incontinentia pigmenti should be included among the neurocutaneous syndromes associated with ischemic strokes in childhood.  this is the first report of a case with incontinentia pigmenti associated with cerebral infarction evaluated by single photon emission computed tomography.  recognition of cerebrovascular accidents as a complication of incontinentia pigmenti will hopefully lead to earlier recognition and treatment.  we suggest that corticosteroid therapy may be an effective treatment during the acute phase of central nervous system dysfunction due to incontinentia pigmenti.  tumor necrosis factor-α expression and oxidative stress are involved in the pathogenesis of brain lesions in children with incontinentia pigmenti, and elevated cerebrospinal fluid cytokine levels may not be apparent during encephalopathic events.  this is the second reported case of bilateral cerebrovascular accidents in a patient with incontinentia pigmenti.  both variegate and acute intermittent porphyria can manifest with various neurological symptoms.  ischemic or hemorrhagic cerebrovascular accidents have been reported rarely in incontinentia pigmenti. ||| ",yes
Are selenium supplements recommended for prostate cancer prevention?,"increased dietary intake of selenium (se) has been suggested to lower prostate cancer mortality, but supplementation trials have produced conflicting results.  daily supplementation with the essential trace mineral selenium significantly reduced prostate cancer risk in men in the nutritional prevention of cancer trial.  growing evidence implies that selenium and vitamin e may decrease the risk of prostate cancer.  evidence suggests that both selenium and vitamin e reduce the risk of prostate cancer.  growing evidence suggests that both selenium and vitamin e may reduce the risk of prostate cancer.  preclinical, epidemiological and phase iii data imply that selenium and vitamin e have potential efficacy for prostate cancer prevention.  preclinical, epidemiologic, and phase iii data suggest that both selenium and vitamin e have potential efficacy in prostate cancer prevention.  preclinical, epidemiological, and phase iii data from randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials suggest that both selenium and vitamin e have potential efficacy in prostate cancer prevention.  selenium and vitamin e are probably 2 of the most popular dietary supplements considered for use in the reduction of prostate cancer risk.  preclinical and epidemiological studies have suggested the use of supplements such as selenium and vitamin e for prostate cancer (pca) prevention; however, clinical trials have not demonstrated clear benefit in patients.  vitamin e and selenium are the two most popular dietary supplements used to prevent prostate cancer.  various formulations of selenium and vitamin e, both essential human dietary components, have been shown to possess a therapeutic and preventive effect against prostate cancer.  epidemiological and clinical data suggest that selenium may prevent prostate cancer, but the biological effects of selenium on normal or malignant prostate cells are not well known.  epidemiologic and clinical data suggest that selenium could prevent prostate cancer, but it has not been shown that supplemental selenium leads to an increased concentration of selenium in prostate tissue compared with adjacent tissue.  the dietary trace element selenium has been proposed to be a potential chemopreventive agent for prostate cancer.  the dietary microelement selenium (se) has been proposed as a potential chemopreventive agent for prostate cancer.  epidemiologic studies and secondary analyses of randomized trials supported the hypothesis that selenium and vitamin e lower prostate cancer risk.  the preclinical and epidemiological evidence supporting a role for selenium and vitamin e as chemopreventive agents in prostate cancer are reviewed, and details of the trial design are presented.  we hypothesize that selenium potentiates vitamin e-induced inhibition of prostate cancer cell growth in vitro.  epidemiological studies and clinical trials show that selenium supplementation results in reduction of prostate cancer incidence; however, the form of selenium and mechanisms underlying protection remain largely unknown. ||| ",no
Are shadow enhancers associated with development?,"many developmental genes are controlled by shadow enhancers—pairs of enhancers that drive overlapping expression patterns.  recent studies have shown that shadow enhancers are remarkably abundant and control most developmental gene expression in both invertebrates and vertebrates, including mammals.  shadow enhancers, groups of seemingly redundant enhancers, are found in a wide range of organisms and are critical for robust developmental patterning.  it was suggested that shadow enhancers help foster robustness in gene expression in response to environmental or genetic perturbations .  these results support the hypothesis that compensatory evolution can occur between shadow enhancers, which has implications for mechanistic and evolutionary studies of gene regulation.  these results suggest that shadow enhancers represent a novel mechanism of canalization whereby complex developmental processes ""bring about one definite end-result regardless of minor variations in conditions"" .  using sequence analysis and experimental perturbation, we show that each shadow enhancer is regulated by different transcription factors.  shadow enhancers are seemingly redundant transcriptional cis-regulatory elements that regulate the same gene and drive overlapping expression patterns.  shadow enhancers can interact in complex ways and may also help to drive the formation of transcriptional hubs within the nucleus.  critical developmental control genes sometimes contain ""shadow"" enhancers that can be located in remote positions, including the introns of neighboring genes .  shadow enhancers might provide an important mechanism for buffering gene expression against mutations in non-coding regulatory regions of genes implicated in human disease.  despite their apparent redundancy, the prevalence and evolutionary conservation of shadow enhancers underscore their key role in emerging metazoan gene regulatory networks.  our results suggest the widespread use of shadow enhancers is partially due to their noise suppressing ability.  technological advances in genome editing and live imaging have shed light on how shadow enhancers establish precise gene expression patterns and confer phenotypic robustness.  evidence is presented that the snail gene is regulated by a distal shadow enhancer located within a neighboring locus.  we hypothesized that shadow enhancers drive consistent expression levels by buffering upstream noise through a separation of transcription factor (tf) inputs at the individual enhancers.  we hypothesized that compensatory evolution can maintain the total expression of a gene, while individual shadow enhancers diverge between species.  by measuring the transcriptional dynamics of several kruppel shadow enhancer configurations in live drosophila embryos, we showed that individual member enhancers act largely independently.  to test this hypothesis, we analyzed expression driven by orthologous pairs of shadow enhancers from drosophila melanogaster, drosophila yakuba, and drosophila pseudoobscura that control expression of krüppel, a transcription factor that patterns the anterior-posterior axis of blastoderm embryos.  both shadows and objects significantly influenced the perceived trajectory of the target, though the influence of the shadow was overall stronger. ||| ",yes
Are sleep apnea and snoring associated with cardiac arrhythmias?,"various cardiac arrhythmias frequently occur in patients with sleep apnea, but complex analysis of the relationship between their severity and the probable arrhythmogenic risk factors is conflicting.  the objective of this study was to identify relationships between sleep apnea, myocardial ischemia and cardiac arrhythmia in patients with coronary artery disease.  in conclusion, sleep apnea modifying cardiovascular risk factors and structures or functions provoked various nocturnal arrhythmias.  according to several studies, obstructive sleep apnea predisposes to cardiac arrhythmias, but the prevalence of sleep apnea in specific arrhythmias has not been determined.  we postulate that the prevalence of nocturnal cardiac arrhythmias is higher among subjects with than without sleep-disordered breathing.  nocturnal cardiac arrhythmia is a common clinical feature of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome.  moderate sleep apnea patients had benign, but more exaggerated cardiac arrhythmias than control subjects (2.53 ± 2.49 vs. 1.13 ± 1.64 degrees of cumulative severity, p < 0.05).  to compare the frequency of daytime and nocturnal cardiac arrhythmias and st-segment depression episodes among patients with obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome (osahs), snoring subjects, and healthy subjects, and to analyze the relationship between the cardiac disturbances, sleep characteristics, and sympathetic tone in patients with osahs.  in this review we highlight the role of obstructive sleep apnea and cheyne-stokes respiration in the pathophysiology of arrhythmias, address their clinical effect in supraventricular and ventricular tachyarrhythmias, and in conduction disturbances, and address the role of current treatment options for sleep-disordered breathing in the primary and secondary prevention of arrhythmic events.  nocturnal cardiac arrhythmias occur in patients with obstructive sleep apnea (osa), reportedly as a consequence of the autonomic effects of recurrent apnea with subsequent oxygen desaturation.  sleep-disordered breathing recurrent intermittent hypoxia and sympathetic nervous system activity surges provide the milieu for cardiac arrhythmia development.  however, the association between sleep apnea and ventricular arrhythmias is unclear.  the purpose of this study was to determine if patients referred for pacemaker therapy with asymptomatic bradyarrhythmias have underlying sleep apnea as the etiology of their bradyarrhythmias.  over the past few years sleep-disordered breathing has been identified as an important factor in arrhythmogenesis and a potential target of therapy to prevent cardiac arrhythmias in selected patients.  there is controversy regarding whether obstructive sleep apnea is responsible for triggering myocardial ischemia, arrhythmias and heart rate variability in patients with coronary artery disease.  this study sought to evaluate respiratory disturbances as potential triggers for arrhythmia in patients with sleep-disordered breathing (sdb).  the arrhythmias usually occur during sleep and contribute to the cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and the treatment of sleep apnea usually results in the resolution of the brady- arrhythmias.  patients with ventricular arrhythmias should be systematically assessed for sleep apnea owing to the potential detrimental effects of sleep apnea in the follow-up period.  sinus arrest, atrio-ventricular block, supraventricular, and ventricular arrhythmias have been reported in patients with sleep apnea syndrome.  sleep-disordered breathing is a common condition associated with nocturnal hypoxaemia, sympathetic activation and haemodynamic stress that can trigger arrhythmias. ||| ",yes
Are splicing speckles associated with transcription?,"we conclude that one function of speckles is to supply splicing factors to active genes.  when single genes are transcriptionally activated in living cells, splicing factors leave speckles in peripheral extensions and accumulate at the new sites of transcription.  we have previously shown that upon transcriptional activation of a gene in vivo, pre-mrna splicing factors are recruited from nuclear speckles, in which they are concentrated, to sites of transcription (misteli, t., j.f.  these results suggest that nuclear speckles play a role in modulating the concentration of splicing factors in the nucleoplasm to regulate alternative pre-mrna splicing.  their targeting into and accumulation in the speckles is a result of the cumulative loading of splicing factors to the pre-mrna and the complexes formed give rise to the speckled pattern observed.  nuclear speckles are thought to be involved in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression, such as pre-mrna splicing.  furthermore, these data demonstrate that the speckled localization of pre-mrna splicing factors is a reflection of the transcriptional and pre-mrna splicing activities of the cell.  speckles are nuclear bodies that contain pre-mrna splicing factors and polyadenylated rna.  the function of speckles and the organization of cellular transcription and pre-mrna splicing in vivo are not well understood.  in this study, we show that, in hela cells, the (pre)spliceosomal assembly on precursor mrna (pre-mrna) is associated with the speckles.  in actively transcribing cells, factors involved in pre-mrna splicing localize in a speckled pattern at the fluorescence microscopic level.  in the mammalian cell nucleus, splicing factors are distributed in nuclear domains known as speckles or splicing factor compartments (sfcs).  however, previous studies have localized splicing factors to a network of ""speckles,"" which is distinct from individual sites of gene transcription where pre-mrna is spliced.  although nuclear speckles are thought to represent reservoirs from which splicing factors are recruited to sites of transcription and splicing, the presence of poly(a) rna in these structures remains enigmatic.  several of the rna substrates with which these factors interact have been shown to localize in tracks that are associated with regions in which splicing factors are concentrated (nuclear speckles).  the speckled distribution of splicing factors in the nucleus is altered when either transcription or pre-mrna splicing activities are interrupted suggesting that the organization of the splicing machinery in the interphase nucleus is a direct reflection of the transcriptional activity of the cell.  accumulation of rna from various actively transcribed speckle-associated genes could contribute to the observed speckle size variations within a single cell.  within the mammalian cell nucleus, most splicing factors are concentrated in 20-40 distinct domains called speckles.  in a previous study (melcák et al., 2001), it has been shown that the pre-spliceosomal assembly on microinjected splicing-competent precursor mrna takes place in the speckles, and it has been suggested that the targeting of rna into speckes consists of two interdependent steps, namely the diffusion process, followed by the energy-dependent translocation of rna into the speckles.  speckles have been detected with antibodies specific for splicing snrnps and members of the sr family of splicing factors. ||| ",no
Are stress granules involved in the pathogenesis of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis?,"stress granules (sgs) form during cellular stress and are implicated in neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia (als/ftd).  stress granules (sgs) are hypothesized to facilitate tar dna-binding protein 43 (tdp-43) cytoplasmic mislocalization and aggregation, which may underly amyotrophic lateral sclerosis pathology.  recent evidence has suggested that stress granules may aid the formation of als protein aggregates.  these findings indicate that the dysfunction induced by prolonged stress granule formation might contribute directly to als and that compounds that mitigate this process may represent a novel therapeutic approach.  many of the genes whose mutation causes amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (als) are rna-binding proteins which localize to stress granules, while others impact the assembly, stability, and elimination of stress granules.  we also assess the evidence linking alterations in stress granule formation and dynamics to als protein aggregates and disease pathology.  in human als spinal cord neurons, pabp accumulates abnormally, suggesting that prolonged stress granule dysfunction may contribute to pathogenesis.  this has led to the hypothesis that alterations in the dynamics of stress granules and rna biology cause als.  a unifying feature of many proteins associated with als, including tdp-43 and ataxin-2, is that they localize to stress granules.  stress granules (sgs) are stress-induced cytoplasmic protein aggregates containing various neuropathogenic proteins, including tdp-43.  misfolded protein aggregates are the hallmark of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (als) which suggests involvement of protein homeostasis pathways in etiology of als.  amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (als)-linked fused in sarcoma/translocated in liposarcoma (fus/tls or fus) is concentrated within cytoplasmic stress granules under conditions of induced stress.  activation of the integrated stress response (isr), alterations in nucleo-cytoplasmic (n/c) transport and changes in alternative splicing regulation are all common traits of the pathogenesis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (als).  amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, a devastating neurodegenerative disease, is characterized by the progressive loss of motor neurons and the accumulation of misfolded protein aggregates.  amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (als) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease characterized by cytoplasmic protein aggregates within motor neurons.  these aggregates are linked to als pathogenesis.  stress induces aggregation of rna-binding proteins to form inclusions, termed stress granules (sgs).  amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (als) is a degenerative motor neuron disease characterized by the formation of cytoplasmic ubiquitinated tdp-43 protein aggregates in motor neurons.  evidence demonstrates that sod1 harboring als-linked mutations is recruited to stress granules, induces changes in alternative splicing, and could be an rna-binding protein.  our data reveal that under certain stress conditions the rates of sg formation and disassembly is modulated by tdp-43 mutations associated with als, and suggest that this may be an early event in the seeding of insoluble cytoplasmic inclusions observed in als. ||| ",yes
Are stress granules membraneous?,"stress granules (sgs) are membrane-less organelles that form in the cytoplasm through phase separation, in response to diverse stressors.  stress granules (sgs) are membraneless organelles formed in response to insult.  stress granules are membraneless protein- and mrna-rich organelles that form in response to perturbations in environmental conditions.  stress granules are cytoplasmic structures that form in response to a variety of cellular stresses.  stress granules are membrane-less organelles composed of rna-binding proteins (rbps) and rna.  stress granules (sgs) are membrane-less ribonucleoprotein condensates that form in response to various stress stimuli via phase separation.  stress granules are rnp-containing particles arising in the cytoplasm in response to environmental stress.  stress granules (sgs) are cytoplasmic condensates containing untranslated mrnp complexes.  we have studied whether the cytoskeleton is involved in the formation of stress granules.  stress granules are membrane-less rna- and rna-binding protein-containing complexes that are transiently assembled in stressful conditions to promote cell survival.  we will provide perspective for future work aimed at further uncovering the form and function of both acute and chronic stress granules and discuss aspects of stress granule biology that have the potential to be exploited in human disease.  here, we describe key aspects of stress granule biology under acute stress, and how these stress granule hallmarks differ in the context of chronic stress conditions.  mammalian stress granules are comprised of two structures - an unstable shell and more stable cores.  cytoplasmic ribonucleoproteins called stress granules (sgs) are considered as one of the main cellular solutions against stress.  stress granules (sgs) are dynamic cytoplasmic aggregates containing mrna, rna-binding proteins, and translation factors that form in response to cellular stress.  our observations suggest that stress granules contain a stable core structure surrounded by a dynamic shell with assembly, disassembly, and transitions between the core and shell modulated by numerous protein and rna remodeling complexes.  mammalian stress granules contain stable structures, referred to as ""cores"" that can be biochemically purified.  herein we describe methodology for isolation of stress granule cores from both yeast and mammalian cells.  stress granules are dynamic, conserved non-translating rna-protein assemblies that form during cellular stress and are related to pathological aggregates in many neurodegenerative diseases.  stress granules are macromolecular aggregates of mrna and proteins assembling in response to stresses that promote the repression of protein synthesis. ||| ",no
Are the Fanconi anemia genes a part of the same signalling pathway?,"a rare hereditary disorder, fanconi anemia (fa), is caused by mutations in an array of genes, which interact in a common fa pathway/network.  at least 15 genes have been identified that are involved in the pathogenesis of fanconi anemia.  fanconi anemia is a rare autosomal recessive or x-linked disorder characterised by clinical and genetic heterogeneity.  fanconi anemia is a rare, inherited disorder characterized by bone marrow failure, congenital malformations, and cancer susceptibility.  the fanconi anemia (fa) proteins overlap with those of homologous recombination through fancd1/brca2, but the biochemical functions of other fa proteins are largely unknown.  fanconi anemia is a rare genetic disease characterized by bone marrow failure, multiple congenital malformations, and an increased susceptibility to malignancy.  fanconi anemia (fa) is a genetically heterogeneous disorder associated with defects in at least eight genes.  fanconi anaemia is a heterogeneous condition associated with mutations in the fanconi anaemia complementation group (fanc).  defects in the fanconi anemia pathway lead to genomic instability and apoptosis of proliferating cells.  this review summarizes the phenotype of each of the fanconi anemia mouse models and highlights how genetic and interventional studies using the strains have yielded novel insight into therapeutic strategies for fanconi anemia and into how the fanconi anemia pathway protects against genomic instability.  fanconi anaemia (fa) is a heterogeneous inherited disorder clinically characterised by progressive bone marrow failure, congenital anomalies and a predisposition to malignancies.  fanconi anemia is a rare inherited disease characterized by congenital anomalies, growth retardation, aplastic anemia and an increased risk of acute myeloid leukemia and squamous cell carcinomas.  the fanca gene is one of the genes in which mutations lead to fanconi anaemia, a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterised by congenital abnormalities, bone marrow failure, and predisposition to malignancy.  described by guido fanconi almost 100 years ago, fanconi anemia (fa) is a rare genetic disease characterized by developmental abnormalities, bone marrow failure (bmf) and cancer predisposition.  mutations in any of at least sixteen fanc genes (fanca-q) cause fanconi anemia, a disorder characterized by sensitivity to dna interstrand crosslinking agents.  fanconi anaemia (fa) is an inherited disease with congenital and developmental abnormalities characterised by cellular cross linker hypersensitivity.  fanconi anaemia (fa) is an autosomal recessive disease characterised by progressive pancytopenia, chromosome instability and an increased risk of cancer.  fanconi anaemia (fa) is a rare, predominantly autosomal recessive syndrome (with one x-linked form) that results in congenital defects, abnormal haematopoiesis and a greatly increased risk of solid tumours in humans.  the group c fanconi anemia gene, fac, identified by expression cloning methods, encodes a protein of unknown function that may be involved in the response to apoptotic stimuli.  to date, 13 complementation groups of fanconi anemia were identified. ||| ",yes
Are the genes for marneral biosynthesis scattered in the genome of A. thaliana?,"previous investigations of a. thaliana have revealed that cyp71a16 catalyzes marneral oxidation, while it also can accept marnerol as substrate.  the arabidopsis thaliana gene encoding cyp71a16 is part of the gene cluster for the biosynthesis and modification of the triterpenoid marneral.  a. thaliana contains four malic enzymes (nadp-me 1-4) to catalyze the reversible oxidative decarboxylation of malate in the presence of nadp.  cyp71a16 catalyzed the hydroxylation of marnerol to 23-hydroxymarnerol with a km of 142μm and a kcat of 3.9min-1.  here, we examine a large number of variants within and between species for a paradigm bgc (the thalianol cluster), which has evolved recently in a common ancestor of the arabidopsis genus.  a heterologous bacterial redox partner system consisting of the flavodoxin ykun from bacillus subtilis and the flavodoxin reductase fpr from e. coli clearly outperformed the cytochrome p450 reductase atr2 from a. thaliana in supporting the cyp71a16-mediated hydroxylation of marnerol.  in view of the application potential of floral parts in secondary metabolite extraction, we characterized for the first time the floral transcriptomes of two key m. malabathricum varieties, purple variety and white variety.  our results provide new insights into the complex regulation of pa and anthocyanin biosynthesis in m. truncatula.  here, we have aimed to sequence the plastid genome of a. marina and its comparison with related species in family acanthaceae.  numerous examples of biosynthetic gene clusters (bgcs), including for compounds of agricultural and medicinal importance, have now been discovered in plant genomes.  expression of these enzymes in wild tobacco (nicotiana benthamiana) resulted in the formation of a surrogate mini-mba, validating the potential for metabolic engineering of mini-mba in a heterologous plant system.  differences in secondary metabolite composition of flowers of 64 arabidopsis thaliana (arabidopsis) natural accessions, representing a considerable portion of the natural variation in this species are presented.  additionally, a shared transcriptional signature across the floral developmental stages was identified in both m. malabathricum varieties; this signature included pathways related to secondary metabolite synthesis, plant hormone signaling and production, energy homeostasis and nutrient assimilation pathways, and cellular proliferation.  here medicago truncatula bhlh mttt8 was characterized as a central component of these ternary complexes that control anthocyanin and pa biosynthesis.  biosynthesis of mba from the flavonol myricetin and mba accumulation occur during early stages of corm development.  interestingly, about 25 forward, 15 reversed and 14 palindromic repeats were also found in the a. marina.  methylthioalkylmalate synthase (mam) catalyzes the committed step in the side chain elongation of met, yielding important precursors for glucosinolate biosynthesis in arabidopsis thaliana and other brassicaceae species.  comparisons at the species level reveal differences in bgc organization and involvement of auxiliary genes, resulting in production of species-specific triterpenes.  mba occurs in corms of the ornamental plant montbretia (crocosmia x crocosmiiflora), but a system for large-scale mba production is currently unavailable.  transcript profiles of ugt77b2, ugt709g2, ccat1, and ccat2 during corm development matched the metabolite profile of mba accumulation. ||| ",no
"Are the human bombesin receptors, GRPR and NMBR, frequently overexpressed G-protein-coupled-receptors by lung-cancers?","human bombesin receptors, grpr and nmbr, are two of the most frequently overexpressed g-protein-coupled-receptors by lung-cancers.  bombesin receptors are overexpressed on a variety of human tumors.  gastrin releasing peptide (grp) receptor (grpr), a bombesin family receptor, is overexpressed in many cancers including breast, prostate, pancreatic and lung.  several forms of cancer, including lung, prostate, breast, and colon over-express receptors for bombesin-like peptides.  gastrin-releasing peptide receptors (grprs), part of the bombesin (bbn) family, are aberrantly overexpressed in many cancers, including those of the breast, prostate, pancreas, and lung, and therefore present an attractive target for cancer diagnosis and therapy.  bombesin and bombesin receptors have been shown to play a role in cancer.  the three mammalian bombesin (bn) receptors (gastrin-releasing peptide  receptor, neuromedin b  receptor, brs-3) are one of the classes of g protein-coupled receptors that are most frequently over-express/ectopically expressed by common, important malignancies.  several human cancers, including small cell lung, prostate, breast, gastric, colon and pancreatic cancers, express receptors for bombesin-like peptides.  neuropeptide g protein-coupled receptors (gpcrs) are overexpressed on numerous cancer cells.  several forms of cancer, including lung, prostate, breast, and colon express receptors for bombesin-like peptides.  twelve of 12 prostate cancers, 41 of 57 breast cancers, and 5 of 5 gastrinomas expressed predominantly grp receptors; 11 of 24 intestinal, 1 of 26 bronchial, and 1 of 1 thymic carcinoids had preferentially nmb receptors; 9 of 26 bronchial carcinoids, 1 large cell neuroendocrine lung carcinoma, and 4 of 9 small cell lung carcinomas had preferentially bb3 receptors, whereas 3 of 9 small cell lung carcinomas had grp receptors.  we investigated 161 human tumors for their bombesin receptor subtype expression using in vitro receptor autoradiography with the universal bombesin radioligand (125)i-bombesin(6-14) in displacement experiments with unlabeled grp, bombesin, nmb, and bombesin(6-14).  bombesin (bn) peptides that bind specifically to these receptors are useful for detection of bombesin receptor-expressing cancers in vivo.  the gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (grpr) has been shown to be overexpressed in many human tumors, including prostate, colon, gastric, breast, pancreatic, and small cell lung cancers.  recently, grpr/nmbr are receiving considerable attention because they act as growth factor receptors often in an autocrine manner in different lung-cancers, affect tumor angiogenesis, their inhibition increases the cytotoxic potency of tyrosine-kinase inhibitors reducing lung-cancer cellular resistance/survival and their overexpression can be used for sensitive tumor localization as well as to target cytotoxic agents to the cancer.  experimental evidence suggests that bombesin (bbs), the pharmacological homologue of grp, promotes breast cancer growth and progression.  tumors such as prostate, small cell lung cancer, breast, gastric, and colon cancer are known to over express receptors to bbn and gastrin-releasing peptide (grp).  gastrin-releasing peptide (grp) receptors are overexpressed on several types of human cancer cells, including breast, prostate, small cell lung, and pancreatic cancers.  these results support the use of a bombesin construct with an antagonist c-terminal vector as a candidate of choice for specific in vivo imaging of tumors overexpressing grp-receptors.  whereas the gastrin-releasing peptide (grp) receptor is a bombesin receptor subtype frequently expressed by tumors, the other three subtypes, the neuromedin b (nmb), bb3, and bb4 receptors, have been poorly investigated in human tissues. ||| ",yes
Are the proteins Erbin (LAP2) and Merlin cooperating?,"to understand its physiological functions, we compared merlin with erm proteins in vivo and in vitro.  these findings do not favor the notion that merlin functions simply in a redundant or competitive manner to erm proteins.  merlin is highly homologous to the erm (ezrin-radixin-moesin) family of membrane/cytoskeleton linker proteins.  merlin, like the closely related erm proteins, appears to provide regulated linkage between membrane-associated proteins and the actin cytoskeleton and is therefore poised to function in receiving and interpreting signals from the extracellular milieu.  in this review we discuss how erm proteins and merlin are negatively regulated by an intramolecular association between their n- and c-terminal domains.  merlin, which shares significant homology with the actin-associated proteins ezrin, radixin and moesin (erm proteins), inhibits cell growth when overexpressed in cell lines.  merlin, the neurofibromatosis 2 tumor suppressor protein, has two major isoforms with alternate c termini and is related to the erm (ezrin, radixin, moesin) proteins.  the similarities between merlin and erm proteins suggest that merlin's growth-regulatory capabilities may be due to alterations in cytoskeletal function.  we also discuss membrane proteins to which erm and merlin bind, including those making an indirect linkage through the pdz-containing adaptor molecules ebp50 and e3karp.  merlin, the tumor suppressor in neurofibromatosis 2, is a diverged member of the ezrin family, but its function is at least partially similar to the erm proteins.  merlin, a neurofibromatosis type-2 tumor suppressor, shows significant sequence similarity to erm (ezrin/radixin/moesin) proteins, general actin filament/plasma membrane cross-linkers, which are regulated in a rho-dependent manner.  because merlin has high level of sequence similarity to the ezrin-radixin-moesin family of proteins, the structural model of ezrin-radixin-moesin protein autoinhibition and cycling between closed/resting and open/active conformational states is often employed to explain merlin function.  we have also explored the effect of merlin self-association on binding to the regulatory cofactor of na(+)-h(+) exchanger (nhe-rf), an interacting protein for merlin and the erms.  finally, we examined the binding affinity of merlin to rho gdp dissociation inhibitor (rho-gdi), to which n-terminal halves of erm proteins but not the full-length molecules specifically bind.  merlin, the product of the nf2 tumor suppressor gene, has sequence similarity to erm proteins and binds to some of the same membrane proteins, but lacks a c-terminal f-actin binding site.  in erm proteins and merlin, interdomain binding promotes auto-inhibition and homo-oligomerization or hetero-oligomerization.  merlin and ezrin proteins belong to the same gene family, i.e., merm containing merlin, ezrin radixin and moesin.  merlin and erm proteins were concentrated at microvilli when introduced into fibroblasts.  in vitro binding assays revealed that the n-terminal halves of merlin isoform-i and -ii as well as full-length merlin isoform-ii bound to rho-gdi with similar binding affinity to erm proteins.  to better understand the cellular functions of the nf2 gene product, merlin, recent work has concentrated on identifying proteins with which it interacts either physically or functionally. ||| ",yes
Are there Conserved Noncoding Elements (CNEs) in invertebrate genomes?,"the genomes of vertebrates, flies, and nematodes contain highly conserved noncoding elements (cnes).  conserved noncoding elements (cnes) are elements exhibiting extreme noncoding conservation in metazoan genomes.  conserved noncoding elements (cncs) are an abundant feature of vertebrate genomes.  one of the key discoveries of vertebrate genome sequencing projects has been the identification of highly conserved noncoding elements (cnes).  highly conserved noncoding elements (cnes) constitute a significant proportion of the genomes of multicellular eukaryotes.  conserved noncoding elements (cnes) in vertebrate genomes often act as developmental enhancers, but a critical issue is how well orthologous cne sequences retain the same activity in their respective species, a characteristic important for generalization of model organism studies.  conserved non-coding elements (cnes) are an abundant group of putative regulatory sequences that are highly conserved across divergent groups and thus assumed to be under strong selective constraint.  many conserved non-coding elements (cnes) in vertebrate genomes have been shown to function as tissue-specific enhancers.  the distribution of these conserved non-coding elements (cne) within and across genomes has suggested that many of them may have roles as transcriptional regulatory elements.  multi-species conserved non-coding elements occur in the vertebrate genome and are clustered in the vicinity of developmentally regulated genes.  these elements, collectively referred to as conserved non-coding elements (cnes), are non-randomly distributed across chromosomes and tend to cluster in the vicinity of genes with regulatory roles in multicellular development and differentiation.  here we report that nematode genomes contain an alternative set of cnes that share sequence characteristics, but not identity, with their vertebrate counterparts.  although conserved noncoding elements (cnes) constitute the majority of sequences under purifying selection in the human genome, they remain poorly understood.  these highly conserved non-coding elements (cnes) are associated with genes that coordinate development, and have been proposed to act as transcriptional enhancers.  despite their extreme sequence conservation in vertebrates, sequences homologous to cnes have not been identified in invertebrates.  a part of gene regulatory elements are expected to be conserved according to their functional importance, so that evolutionarily conserved noncoding sequences (cnss) might be good candidates for those elements.  highly conserved noncoding sequences (cnss) have proven to be reliable indicators of functionally constrained sequences such as cis-regulatory elements and noncoding rna genes.  vertebrate genomes share numerous conserved non-coding elements, many of which function as enhancer elements and are hypothesised to be under evolutionary constraint due to a need to be bound by combinations of sequence-specific transcription factors.  in contrast, few such conserved elements can be detected between vertebrates and their closest invertebrate relatives.  conserved non-coding sequences (cns) are islands of non-coding sequence that, like protein coding exons, show less divergence in sequence between related species than functionless dna. ||| ",yes
Are there Conserved Noncoding Elements (CNEs) in plant genomes?,"conserved noncoding elements (cnes) are elements exhibiting extreme noncoding conservation in metazoan genomes.  highly conserved noncoding elements (cnes) constitute a significant proportion of the genomes of multicellular eukaryotes.  plant genomes contain both protein-coding and noncoding sequences including transposable elements (tes) and noncoding rnas (ncrnas).  in vertebrates, conserved noncoding elements (cnes) are functionally constrained sequences that can show striking conservation over >400 million years of evolutionary distance and frequently are located megabases away from target developmental genes.  conserved noncoding sequences (cnss) in plants are much shorter, and it has been difficult to detect conservation among distantly related genomes.  surveys for conserved noncoding sequences (cns) among genes from monocot cereal species were conducted to assess the general properties of cns in grass genomes and their correlation with known promoter regulatory elements.  plant conserved noncoding sequences (cnss)--a specific category of phylogenetic footprint--have been shown experimentally to function.  conserved noncoding sequences (cnss) are evolutionarily conserved dna sequences that do not encode proteins but may have potential regulatory roles in gene expression.  no plant cns is conserved to the extent that ultraconserved noncoding sequences are conserved in vertebrates.  many studies on conserved noncoding sequences (cnss) have found that cnss are enriched significantly in regulatory sequence elements.  the ncrnas are recognized as important elements that play fundamental roles in the structural organization and function of plant genomes.  in this article, we show not only that cns sequences can be detected throughout the eudicot clade of flowering plants, but also that a subset of 37 cnss can be found in all flowering plants (diverging ∼170 million years ago).  conserved noncoding sequences (cnss) in dna are reliable pointers to regulatory elements controlling gene expression.  cns in crop genomes could be linked to many important agronomic traits and ecological adaptations.  conserved non-coding sequences (cns) are islands of non-coding sequence that, like protein coding exons, show less divergence in sequence between related species than functionless dna.  instances of highly conserved plant short interspersed nuclear element (sine) families and their enrichment near genes have been well documented, but little is known about the general patterns of such conservation and enrichment and underlying mechanisms.  we conducted whole-genome analysis on plant cnss to identify lineage-specific cnss in eudicots, monocots, angiosperms,and vascular plants based on the premise that lineage-specific cnss define lineage-specific characters and functions in groups of organisms.  comparative genomics approaches have identified numerous conserved cis-regulatory sequences near genes in plant genomes.  these cnss are candidate regulatory elements, which are expected to define lineage-specific features of various plant groups.  recently, a novel type of non-coding rna (ncrna), known as ncrna fragments or ncrfs, has been characterised in various organisms, including plants. ||| ",yes
Are there RNAi approaches considered for the treatment of kidney injury?,"rnai-based strategies provide a great therapeutic potential for treatment of various human diseases including kidney disorders, but face the challenge of in vivo delivery and specific targeting.  it is also expected that rnai might one day be used to treat human diseases.  rna interfering (rnai), mediated by small interfering rnas and micrornas, is currently one of the most promising tools of gene therapy.  data from clinical experiments have been used to discuss and support the administration of silencing rna for the treatment of kidney diseases.  since the recent development of rnai technology in the mammalian system, investigators have used rnai to elucidate gene function, and to develop gene-based therapeutics by delivery exogenous sirna or sirna expressing vector.  therapies based on sirnas for patients with glomerulonephritis show promise, although tissue-specific protocols using sirnas have not yet been established for this indication.  experimental evidence to support the clinical relevance of sirna administration in the treatment of renal disease is discussed.  rna interference (rnai) represents a promising new approach to the inhibition of gene expression in vitro and in vivo, and has therapeutic potential for human diseases.  rna interference targeting relb can significantly attenuate ischemia/reperfusion (i/r)-induced renal dysfunction, but its roles in liver i/r injury remain to be defined.  administered sirna provides a novel experimental and potential therapeutic tool for gene silencing in the kidney.  there is increasing interest in studying their function in the kidney, but the majority of studies to date use kidney cell lines and assess the total amounts of mirnas of interest either by qpcr or by high-throughput methods such as next generation sequencing.  here we review recent approaches to target renal protein expression under normal and pathological conditions.  rnai is mediated by small interfering rnas (sirna), and thus sirna delivery in vivo is of critical importance for its implementation.  furthermore, rnai targeting against tgf-beta1 significantly suppressed tgf-beta1 mrna and protein expression, thereby ameliorated the progression of matrix expansion in experimental glomerulonephritis.  rna interference (rnai) provides the means for alternative antiviral therapy.  in addition, novel delivery approaches for glomerulus-targeted, sirna-based therapies are described.  the kidney has been the target organ for the delivery of silencing ribonucleic acids (silencing rna) administered systemically in comparison to other body tissues.  however, in vivo delivery of sirna targeting the kidney has been described in only a few reports.  the currently published papers reporting the discovery and mechanism of rnai phenomena and application of rnai on gene function in mammalian cells were included.  here we provide details of an experimental protocol showing that 1) delivery of sirna targeting enhanced green fluorescent protein (egfp) to the kidney in the transgenic ""green"" rat reduces endogenous egfp expression, mainly in the glomerular mesangial cells, and that 2) delivery of sirna targeting transforming growth factor (tgf)-beta1 to the kidney significantly suppresses messenger rna (mrna) and protein expression of tgf-beta1, thereby ameliorating the progression of matrix expansion in experimental glomerulonephritis. ||| ",yes
Are there any DNMT3 proteins present in plants?,"this is a first report describing transcriptome and interactome of dnmt2 in any land plant.  dnmt2 is a dna/trna cytosine methyltransferase that is highly conserved in structure and function in eukaryotes.  we have previously reported that in the moss physcomitrella patens, dnmt2 plays a crucial role in stress recovery and trnaasp transcription/stability under salt stress.  dna methyltransferase 2 (dnmt2) unlike other members of the cytosine dna methyltransferase gene family has dual substrate specificity and it methylates cytosines in both the dna and transfer rna (trna).  therefore, to study its role in stress tolerance, we generated ppdnmt2 targeted knockout plants (ppdnmt2ko).  the nucleo-mitochondrial dual-localized proteins can act as gene expression regulators; however, few instances of these proteins have been described in plants.  the ethylene-insensitive3/ethylene-insensitive3-like (ein3/eil) proteins are a type of nuclear-localized protein with dna-binding activity in plants.  in this study, we demonstrate that dnmt2 from physcomitrella patens accumulates in a temporal manner under salt and osmotic stress showing maximum accumulation during recovery, i.e.  in a yeast two-hybrid screening, using wheat e2f as a bait, we have isolated a cdna clone encoding a wheat dp (tmdp) protein.  taken together, the work presented in this study sheds light on diverse roles of ppdnmt2 in maintaining molecular and physiological homeostasis in p. patens.  in animal cells, e2fs interact with dp proteins, whose identification in plants has been elusive, so far.  ppdnmt2ko, however, accumulate normal levels of dehydrin-like and small heat shock protein encoding transcripts under stress but show dramatic reduction in levels of trna(a) (sp-) (guc) .  therefore, homolog opt3 proteins in several plant species were investigated and characterized using bioinformatical tools.  ppdnmt2 possibly exists in complex with cuzn-sods in vivo and the two proteins also directly interact in the yeast nucleus as observed by yeast two-hybrid assay.  nt-tasvd and nt-sb2 plants were genetically crossed.  contrary to the specificity observed for the plant rbr/e2f interaction, human and plant e2f and dp proteins can interact in a heterologous manner.  to further investigate the role of ppdnmt2 at genome level, in this study we have performed rna sequencing of ppdnmt2.  atopt3 usually seemed to take part in fe homeostasis whereas zmopt3 putatively interacted with proteins involved in various biological processes from plant defense system to stress responses.  although systematic characterization of burp domain-containing proteins have been carried out in many species, such as rice, poplar and maize, little is known about burp domain-containing proteins in medicago.  burp domain-containing proteins belong to a newly identified protein class that is unique to plants and plays an important role in plant development and metabolism. ||| ",yes
Are there any Decision support systems for chronic pain management ?,"we tested whether computer-based decision support (cbds) could enhance the ability of primary care physicians (pcps) to manage chronic pain.  clinical decision support systems (cdsss) may help clinicians prescribe opioids for chronic noncancer pain (cncp) more appropriately.  our findings indicate that clinicians caring for chronic pain need decision support that aggregates many disparate information elements and helps them navigate and contextualize that information.  as pain is highly subjective, clinical decision support systems (cdsss) can be critical for improving the accuracy of pain assessment and offering better support for clinical decision-making.  a pain specialist used a decision support system to determine appropriate pain therapy and sent letters to the referring physicians outlining these recommendations.  this review is focused on computer technologies for pain management that allow cdsss to obtain knowledge from the clinical data produced by either patients or health care professionals.  despite the known effectiveness of clinical decision support systems (cdss), none of these are available for back pain management.  many clinical decision support tools or databases are available to clinicians.  the use of computerized clinical decision support systems may improve the diagnosis and ongoing management of chronic diseases, which requires recurrent visits to multiple health professionals, disease and medication monitoring and modification of patient behavior.  the objective of this study was to identify information needs and decision support requirements for assessing, diagnosing, and treating chronic noncancer pain in primary care.  the use of computerized clinical decision support systems (ccdsss) may improve chronic disease management, which requires recurrent visits to multiple health professionals, ongoing disease and treatment monitoring, and patient behavior modification.  computer-based decision support systems can improve the process of care, but whether they improve patient outcomes in a cost-effective manner is uncertain.  given the scarcity of trustworthy clinical practice guidelines providing recommendations to answer clinicians' daily questions, clinical decision support systems (ie, assistance in question identification and answering) emerge as an attractive alternative.  however, these systems play an important role in the design of computerised systems oriented to a patient's symptoms as is required for pain management.  a novel cdss tool has the potential to assist with evidence-based management of back pain.  a comprehensive literature search was conducted in several electronic databases to identify relevant articles focused on computerised systems that constituted cdsss and include data or results related to pain symptoms from patients with acute or chronic pain, published between 1992 and 2011 in the english language.  clinical decision support (cds) systems provide clinicians and other health care stakeholders with patient-specific assessments or recommendations to aid in the clinical decision-making process.  few clinical guideline-based decision support systems (dss) have been successfully applied in chronic disease management.  the use of a cbds system may improve the ability of pcps to manage chronic pain and may also facilitate screening of consults to optimize specialist utilization.  clinical decision-support systems (cdsss) are computer programs that are designed to provide expert support for health professionals making clinical decisions. ||| ",yes
Are there any HCV replication inhibitors available?,"a number of novel, small molecular inhibitors of hcv replication are now entering early clinical trials in humans.  there is no effective therapy or vaccine available to hcv-infected patients other than interferon-ribavarin combination, which is effective in a relatively small percentage of infected patients.  in general, direct antivirals are potent inhibitors of hcv replication and can result in rapid declines in serum hcv rna levels.  to date the only two therapies approved for the treatment of hcv infection are interferon (ifn)-alpha and the nucleoside analogue, ribavirin.  the development of low molecular weight inhibitors of hepatitis c virus (hcv) replication has been hindered by the lack of a good cell-based system that models the entire hcv replication cycle.  to address this, multiple new direct acting antiviral drugs which specifically target the non-structural proteins involved in hcv replication are in phase ii/iii development.  treatment for those infected with chronic hepatitis c virus  has until recently been hampered by the lack of therapies other than pegylated interferon and ribavirin, which have limited efficacy and a difficult side effect profile.  this review will discuss the hcv replication cycle, mechanisms of action of the new direct acting antiviral drugs, results from published trials into their efficacy and the potential for interferon free treatment regimens in the future.  compounds that block replication of subgenomic hcv rna in liver cells are of interest because of their demonstrated antiviral effect in the clinic.  chronic hepatitis c virus (hcv) infection is a significant worldwide health problem with limited therapeutic options.  here, we provide current information regarding the effectiveness of direct antivirals in treating chronic hcv infection and discuss the key questions and challenges now facing the field.  these results suggest that itafs could be potential targets to block hcv replication.  however, assessment of their efficacy and ability to inhibit replication of different genotypes is hampered by the lack of a convenient animal model or a method for in vitro culture of hcv other than the type 1/2-based replicons and the infectious genotype 2a clone jfh1.  infections caused by hepatitis c virus (hcv) are a significant world health problem for which novel therapies are in urgent demand.  in this phase 2, open-label study, we assessed treatment with the ns5a inhibitor ledipasvir, the nucleotide polymerase inhibitor sofosbuvir, and ribavirin in patients infected with hcv genotypes 1 or 4.  protease inhibitors (pis) of hepatitis c virus (hcv) provide an additional or alternative therapy for chronic infection.  furthermore, isg viperin has anti-hcv activity in vitro; we postulate that viperin, along with other isgs, acts to limit hcv replication.  the development of inhibitors of the hcv ns5b rna polymerase represents a promising strategy for identifying novel anti-hcv therapeutics.  antiviral agents specifically targeting either the hcv protease or polymerase, or other targets, are now in clinical development.  the 293b4alpha cell line has been formatted into a semi-high throughput, cell-based screen for inhibitors of hcv replication. ||| ",yes
Are there any animal models for Niemann-Pick C1 disease?,"a mouse model of niemann-pick type c disease has been found that exhibits neuropathology similar to the human condition.  niemann-pick disease, type c1 (npc1) is a rare neurodegenerative lysosomal storage disease with a wide spectrum of clinical manifestation.  niemann-pick disease, type c1 (npc1) is an autosomal recessive lipid storage disorder in which a pathological cascade, including neuroinflammation occurs.  the balb/c mouse model of niemann-pick type c disease exhibits similar neuropathological features to the human condition, including cerebral atrophy, demyelination of the corpus callosum, and degeneration of cerebellar purkinje cells.  niemann-pick type c disease (npc) is a rare human disease, with limited effective treatment options.  niemann-pick disease type c (np-c) is a progressive neurological disorder of lipid metabolism.  niemann-pick type c1 disease (npc1) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by mutations in the npc1 gene.  niemann-pick disease type c1 (npc) is an autosomal recessive cholesterol-storage disorder characterized by liver dysfunction, hepatosplenomegaly and progressive neurodegeneration.  feline niemann-pick disease type c (npc) is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disease which shares many of the clinical, biochemical and pathological features of the corresponding human disorder.  niemann-pick disease type c (np-c) is an autosomal recessive neurovisceral storage disease with neurodegeneration caused by mutations in either the npc-1 or npc-2 gene.  niemann-pick disease type c1 (npc1) is a genetic neurovisceral disorder characterized by abnormalities in intracellular sterol trafficking.  niemann-pick type c1 (npc1) disease is a neurodegenerative lysosomal storage disorder caused by mutations in the npc1 gene which encodes a transmembrane protein of the acidic compartment.  niemann-pick type c (npc) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by progressive cell death in various tissues, particularly in the cerebellar purkinje cells, with no known cure.  niemann-pick type c (npc) is a disease that affects intracellular cholesterol-trafficking pathways.  niemann-pick c, type 1 (npc1) is a progressive autosomal recessive neurologic disease caused by defective intracellular cholesterol and lipid trafficking.  although niemann-pick c1 disease has frequently been called ""juvenile alzheimer's"", the effects of introducing npc1 mutations into a mouse model of alzheimer's have not previously been performed.  the gene defect in niemann-pick c disease causes cholesterol to accumulate within the lysosomal compartment of neurons and glial cells.  niemann-pick disease type c1 (npc1) and type c2 (npc2) display the same pattern of neurovisceral storage due to deficiencies within lysosomes.  autosomal recessive inheritance of npc1 with loss-of-function mutations underlies niemann-pick disease, type c1 (np-c1), a lysosomal storage disorder with progressive neurodegeneration.  some shanghai clinical center f a role of niemann-pick type c1 (npc1) for obesity traits. ||| ",yes
Are there any clinical trials of the effect of evening primrose oil on postmenopausal symptoms ?,"this study could provide evidence regarding the potential benefits of evening primrose oil for the psychological symptoms of postmenopausal women.  the purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy and safety of evening primrose oil on women's psychological symptoms during menopause.  a systematic literature search of clinical trials of evening primrose oil (epo) for the treatment of the premenstrual syndrome (pms) was carried out with a view to performing a meta-analysis.  the therapeutic effectiveness of evening primrose oil (efamol, vita-glow) in the relief of 10 symptoms associated with premenstrual syndrome (pms) as well as menstrual symptoms was studied in 38 women.  the aim of this study is to investigate the dose-response treatment effects of evening primrose oil on clinical symptoms of ad and serum concentrations of polyunsaturated fatty acids.  this systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to establish the results of clinical trials performed on the effect of evening primrose oil on labor induction and cervical ripening in pregnant women.  to distinguish the effect of evening primrose oil, we compared the reduction in the psychological score in each group.  evening primrose oil is widely used by many midwives to hasten cervical ripening in an effort to shorten labor and decrease the incidence of postdates pregnancies.  this pilot study showed pumpkin seed oil had some benefits for postmenopausal women and provided strong evidence to support further studies.  the purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of oral evening primrose oil on the length of pregnancy and selected intrapartum outcomes in low-risk nulliparous women.  this study evaluated the effects of phytoestrogen supplement on quality of life for postmenopausal women.  this study demonstrates that evening primrose oil does not significantly effect the natural history of breast fibroadenomas.  this study is the first to evaluate the benefit of pumpkin seed oil in postmenopausal women.  previous clinical trials with evening primrose oil in atopic dermatitis (ad) treatment have shown different results.  the effects of oil of evening primrose oil on fibroadenomas was assessed over a 6-month period.  eligible women randomly received either 1,000 mg of evening primrose oil capsules daily or matching placebo for 8 weeks.  we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials on the effects of phytoestrogen supplements on the quality of life of postmenopausal women.  there was inconsistent evidence about the benefit of vitamin d plus evening primrose oil (epo) supplement intake on lipid profiles and reduced oxidative stress among women with polycystic ovary syndrome (pcos).  the evening primrose oil has prostaglandin effects and is applied to soften the cervix.  findings suggest that the oral administration of evening primrose oil from the 37th gestational week until birth does not shorten gestation or decrease the overall length of labor. ||| ",yes
Are there any desmins present in plants?,"they have been identified in many plants.  many genes encoding desiccation-related proteins (drps) have been identified in the resurrection plant craterostigma plantagineum, but the function of these genes remains mainly hypothetical.  plant genomes contain several hundred defensin-like (defl) genes that encode short cysteine-rich proteins resembling defensins, which are well known antimicrobial polypeptides.  seeds) and vegetative tissues of resurrection plants can tolerate desiccation.  like other eukaryotes, plants use dicer-like (dcl) proteins as the central enzymes of rna silencing, which regulates gene expression and mediates defense against viruses.  in addition, unlike animal dynamins, there was no evidence for the involvement of any plant dynamin-like protein in clathrin-mediated vesicle trafficking.  in model plants, at least four dcls have been found and a number of studies have helped to understand their function.  reproductive structures of plants (e.g.  (ls), a desiccation sensitive plant, the lea-like 11-24 transcripts are expressed at a low level.  dense vesicles (dvs) are vesicular carriers, unique to plants, that mediate post-golgi trafficking of storage proteins to protein storage vacuoles (psvs) in seeds.  compared to mammals and yeast, relatively few ld proteins have been identified in plants, particularly those associated with lds in vegetative (non-seed) cell types.  both model plants contain a subset of defls specifically expressed in seeds or fruits.  in vanilla leaves, transcripts of oleosins of the u lineage were present in both epidermis and mesophyll, but oleosin occurred only in epidermis.  immuno-confocal laser scanning microscopy revealed that oleosin was present mostly on the small lds.  a legumin-like protein and a vicilin-like protein are the essential storage proteins in dicotyledonous plants.  plant dynamin-like proteins consist of a group of high molecular weight gtpase with diverse structural arrangements and cellular localizations.  further, the sd from the erd7 homolog in humans, spartin, localized to lds in plant cells, similar to its localization in mammals; although, in mammalian cells, spartin also conditionally localizes to other subcellular compartments, including mitochondria.  the epidermis but not mesophyll of leaves of vanilla (vanilla planifolia) and most other asparagales species contained solitary and clustered lds (<0.5 μm), some previously studied by electron microscopy and speculated to be for cuticle formation.  however, the function of the dicer or dcls in other plants is still unclear.  in the desiccation tolerant plants c. plantagineum (cp) and lindernia brevidens skan (lb) transcripts encoding lea-like 11-24 protein are abundantly expressed during desiccation whereas in lindernia subracemosa de wild. ||| ",no
Are there any functional differences between Mfd and its human Cocaine syndrome protein B (CSB) homolog?,"we conclude that the brains of cocaine patients are structurally dissimilar from those of nondrug-using controls.  both cocaine treatment regimens significantly increased mor protein levels and protein stability, but only multiple intermittent treatments increased mor mrna levels as well as c-fos mrna levels and activator protein 1 binding activity.  (+)-cocaine, although not the naturally occurring stereoisomer, was 10-20-fold more potent than (-)-cocaine in competing for binding to the primary muscarinic recognition site.  the remarkable difference in the catalytic activity between mcoch and hcoch is consistent with the difference between the enzyme-(-)-cocaine binding modes obtained from molecular modelling.  here we show that brain-derived neurotrophic factor (bdnf) signaling through tyrosine kinase b (trkb) receptors in nacsh neurons is necessary for cocaine-induced dendritic spine formation by using either localized trkb knockout or viral-mediated expression of a dominant negative, kinase-dead trkb mutant.  srif neurons were more susceptible than npy neurons to the effects of cocaine.  given the important role of d1-msns in brain reward function, the present findings provide new insight into mechanisms by which brain cb2rs modulate cocaine action.  together, these findings indicate that bdnf-trkb signaling both mediates and reverses cocaine-induced increases in dendritic spine density in nacsh neurons, and these morphological changes are entirely dissociable from changes in addictive behavior.  according to the kinetic data, the catalytic efficiency (k(cat)/k(m)) of mbche against (-)-cocaine is comparable with that of hbche, but the catalytic efficiency of mcoch against (-)-cocaine is remarkably lower than that of hcoch by ~250-fold.  loss of trkb function after cocaine self-administration, however, leaves spine density intact but markedly enhances the motivation for cocaine, an effect mediated by specific loss of trkb signaling through phospholipase cgamma1 (plcγ1).  naturally occurring (-)-cocaine, in comparison with the corresponding human bche (hbche) and an hbche-based cocaine hydrolase (hcoch, i.e.  cocaine dependence is associated with abnormalities in brain structure in humans.  these data suggest that the high-affinity binding sites for cocaine and imipramine in the cerebral cortex are distinct entities.  results showed an enhanced rsfc within the sensory motor cortex and the left frontal-parietal network in cocaine users than controls.  structural deficiencies within limbic and prefrontal regions may contribute to the characteristic drug-seeking and drug-taking behaviors that prevail in persons dependent on cocaine.  cocaine was not selective for muscarinic receptor subtypes.  cocaine exposure has been reported to alter central μ-opioid receptor (mor) expression in vivo.  based on these novel findings, it is hypothesized that epigenetic mechanisms are implicated in cocaine's action on mor expression in neurons.  however, it is unclear whether these differences in brain structure predispose an individual to drug use or are a result of cocaine's action on the brain.  this study investigates the impact of chronic cocaine exposure on brain structure and drug-related behavior in mice. ||| ",yes
Are there any specific antidotes for dabigatran?,"unlike warfarin, dabigatran has no known antidote.  dabigatran is a new oral direct thrombin inhibitor.  now, a specific antidote for the direct thrombin inhibitor, dabigatran has been approved for use, and antidotes for factor xa inhibitors (rivaroxaban, apixaban and edoxaban) are being developed.  this review summarizes current knowledge on key pharmacological features and the assessment of dabigatran activity.  an antidote for dabigatran inhibiting thrombin (idarucizumab) is available but no antidote is yet approved for the factor xa (fxa) inhibitors (xabans).  dabigatran is an oral direct thrombin inhibitor that is food and drug administration-approved for prevention of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation.  a monoclonal antibody has been developed to neutralize the anticoagulant effect of dabigatran.  dabigatran, a direct thrombin inhibitor, is effective for the treatment of venous thromboembolism and the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism resulting from atrial fibrillation.  dabigatran etexilate (dabigatran) is a direct thrombin inhibitor anticoagulant agent.  anti-coagulation therapy with dabigatran (150mg b.i.d.  the oral thrombin inhibitor dabigatran has the drawbacks that it does not have a validated antidote.  dabigatran is a reversible direct thrombin inhibitor recently approved for stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation.  no antidote is available for reversal of dabigatran's anticoagulant effect.  dabigatran etexilate is one of the newer oral anticoagulants and a direct thrombin inhibitor.  in recent years, dabigatran has emerged as a popular alternative to warfarin for treatment of atrial fibrillation.  dabigatran, a new direct thrombin inhibitor, achieves strong anticoagulation that is more predictable than warfarin.  although dabigatran, a novel oral anti-coagulant, has been approved for the prevention of thromboembolism in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation, the efficacy of dabigatran for the resolution of established intra-cardiac thrombi has not been validated.  two patients presented following deliberate dabigatran overdoses.  hence, dabigatran may represent an alternative to warfarin as a therapeutic option in patients with previously detected intra-cardiac thrombus.  there is limited experience with dabigatran overdoses. ||| ",no
Are there any specific antidotes for rivaroxaban?,"rivaroxaban is an oral direct factor xa inhibitor developed for prophylaxis and treatment of thromboembolic disorders.  rivaroxaban, an oral, direct factor xa inhibitor, is one of the most used.  rivaroxaban is an oral direct factor xa inhibitor that has been marketed worldwide since 2008 for the primary and secondary prevention and treatment of thromboembolic disorders.  rivaroxaban, a factor xa inhibitor, is a new oral anticoagulant that has been developed as an alternative to vitamin k antagonists.  rivaroxaban is an oral, direct factor xa inhibitor, approved for the prevention and treatment of several thromboembolic disorders.  rivaroxaban is a novel xa inhibitor with an encouraging anti-thrombosis effect.  rivaroxaban is a direct oral anti-factor xa anticoagulant.  rivaroxaban is an oral direct factor xa inhibitor that is noninferior to warfarin in the prevention of recurrent venous thromboembolism (vte).  at present no antidote is appointed and no guidelines have been formulated for the measurement of rivaroxaban reversal.  rivaroxaban, a novel oral anticoagulant drug, is widely used in clinical practice.  rivaroxaban is a once-daily oral anticoagulant currently indicated for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation.  despite several advantages of the novel anticoagulant rivaroxaban compared with vitamin k antagonists (vka), its lack of specific antidotes to reverse anticoagulant effects may increase the risk profile of patients with bleeding complications.  rivaroxaban is the first licensed oral direct inhibitor of factor xa.  rivaroxaban is a united states food and drug administration-approved oral anticoagulant for venous thromboembolic disease; however, there is no information regarding the safety and its efficacy to support its use in patients after open or endovascular arterial interventions.  in summary, prophylactic anticoagulation with rivaroxaban appears to be a cost effective, and perhaps cost saving, alternative to warfarin for the prevention of recurrent vte.  the management of patients treated with rivaroxaban who require urgent surgery is discussed in this report.  rivaroxaban and dabigatran are new oral anticoagulants that specifically inhibit factor xa and thrombin, respectively.  rivaroxaban has been approved as an antithrombotic agent for prevention of venous thromboembolism with specific indications.  here, we explore the management strategies in patients receiving rivaroxaban who have a bleeding emergency or require emergency surgery.  reported randomized controlled trials comparing the safety of rivaroxaban with that of vitamin k antagonists (warfarin, acenocoumarol, phenprocoumon, and fluindione) were systematically searched. ||| ",no
Are there any statistical methods for normalizing and identifying differential regions in histone modification ChIP-seq data?,"our results show that histonehmm outperforms competing methods in detecting functionally relevant differentially modified regions.  histonehmm outputs probabilistic classifications of genomic regions as being either modified in both samples, unmodified in both samples or differentially modified between samples.  for histone modification data with broadly enriched regions, pepr identified differential regions that are consistent within groups and outperformed other methods in scaling false discovery rate (fdr) analysis.  chip-seq has become a routine method for interrogating the genome-wide distribution of various histone modifications.  our results demonstrate that higher order features of chip-seq peaks carry relevant and often complementary information to total counts, and hence are important in assessing differential histone modifications and transcription factor binding.  chip-seq is highly utilized for mapping histone modifications that are informative about gene regulation and genome annotations.  chip-seq is increasingly being used for genome-wide profiling of histone modification marks.  to address this limitation we introduce histonehmm, a powerful bivariate hidden markov model for the differential analysis of histone modifications with broad genomic footprints.  this includes an evaluation procedure that associates differential peaks with changes in gene expression as well as histone modifications close to these peaks.  our empirical analysis shows that the method yields reproducible results across experiments, and is able to detect functional important changes in histone modifications.  here we present a genome-wide quantitative method for combinatorial indexed chromatin immunoprecipitation (co-chip) to characterize co-occurrence of histone modifications on nucleosomes.  histone modifications play an important role in chromatin organization and transcriptional regulation, but despite the large amount of genome-wide histone modification data collected in different cells and tissues, little is known about co-occurrence of modifications on the same nucleosome.  datasets of matched transcription data and histone modification data obtained by chip-seq exist, but methods for integrative analysis of both data types are still rare.  we demonstrate its usefulness with a wide range of data-driven computational experiments and with a case study of histone modifications on gata1-occupied segments during erythroid differentiation.  however, comparative analysis of samples remains challenging for histone modifications with broad domains, such as heterochromatin-associated h3k27me3, as most chip-seq algorithms are designed to detect well defined peak-like features.  here, we present a novel bioinformatics approach to detect genes that show different transcript abundances between two conditions putatively caused by alterations in histone modification.  here we present chromclust, a semi-supervised clustering tool for mining commonly occurring histone modifications at various locations of the genome.  mining patterns of histone modifications interplay from epigenomic profiles are one of the leading research areas these days.  the generation of genome-wide maps of histone modifications using chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing is a standard approach to dissect the complexity of the epigenome.  for example, applying chip-seq to histone modifications such as h3k4me1 has facilitated generating epigenomic maps of putative enhancers. ||| ",yes
Are there any urine biomarkers for bladder cancer diagnosis?,"in this review, we aimed to summarize the current knowledge on commercially available and promising investigational urine markers for the detection and surveillance of bladder cancer.  urinary biomarkers are promising as simple alternatives to cystoscopy for the diagnosis of recurrent bladder cancer.  potential biochemical markers excreted in the urine of bladder cancer patients have been considered, with the conclusion that none alone has yet proven to be useful as a screening procedure for the detection of urothelial cancer.  numerous molecular urine markers for the diagnosis of bladder cancer have been developed and evaluated mostly in case-control settings through the past decades.  many molecular assays for bladder cancer diagnosis and surveillance have been developed over the past several decades.  current methods in the noninvasive detection and surveillance of bladder cancer via urine analysis include voided urine cytology (vuc) and some diagnostic urinary protein biomarkers; however, due to the poor sensitivity of vuc and high false-positive rates of currently available protein assays, detection of bladder cancer via urinalysis remains a challenge.  many tumor markers for bladder cancer have been evaluated for use in detecting and monitoring bladder cancers tissue specimens, bladder washes, and urine specimens.  in the present study, comparative urine metabolomics selected putative metabolite markers for the detection of early-stage bladder cancer.  there are very few biomarkers used to diagnose bladder cancer and no clinically approved biomarkers for prediction or prognostication of this disease.  several urine markers have been and are currently being investigated for the diagnosis and prognostication of bladder malignancies.  our goal is to find non-invasive marker candidates that may help us gain insight into the metabolism of early-stage bladder cancer and be examined in routine health checks.  the ability to detect and monitor bladder cancer in noninvasively obtained urine samples is a major goal.  urine markers have been extensively studied to help improve the diagnosis of bladder cancer with the goal of complementing or even replacing cystoscopy.  pubmed/medline search was conducted to identify original articles, review articles, and editorials regarding urine-based biomarkers for screening, early detection, and surveillance of urothelial carcinoma of the bladder.  the appropriate use of these approaches has the potential to provide efficient biomarkers for the early detection and monitoring of recurrent bladder cancer.  the aim of this retrospective longitudinal analysis was to investigate if a molecular marker might be able to replace cystoscopy as a primary examination in diagnosis and follow-up of patients with pta grade 1-2 bladder cancer.  markers for aberrant methylation may be a potential gateway for monitoring bladder cancer.  bladder cancer detection and surveillance includes cystoscopy and cytology.  this longitudinal study suggests a potential of molecular urine tests in replacing cystoscopy in the follow-up of patients with pta g1-2 bladder cancer.  well-designed protocols and prospective, controlled trials are needed to provide the basis to determine whether integration of biomarkers into clinical decision making will be of value for bladder cancer detection and screening in the future. ||| ",yes
Are there any urine biomarkers for chronic kidney disease?,"the contrast between a high prevalence of chronic kidney disease (ckd) and the low incidence of end-stage renal disease highlights the need for new biomarkers of progression beyond albuminuria testing.  urine is a source of potential markers of disease.  diagnosis of kidney disease is currently and primarily based on the measurement of serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, and urine output, and most kidney diseases with elevated serum creatinine accompany abnormal findings of urinalysis with microscopy, such as proteinuria or hematuria.  noninvasive molecular tests of urine cells have been developed to monitor the activity of kidney diseases.  urinary proteomic analyses had a high diagnostic accuracy for ckd, including hypertensive nephropathy, and strongly improved identification of patients with rapid kidney function decline beyond albuminuria testing.  in the context of renal disease, urine is particularly important as it may directly reflect kidney injury.  however, there are no established markers for early diagnosis or predicting renal prognosis.  current markers of renal dysfunction lack both optimal specificity and sensitivity, and improved technologies and approaches are needed.  among patients with chronic kidney disease, urine levels of ngal, a marker of renal tubular injury, were associated independently with future ischemic atherosclerotic events, but not with heart failure events or deaths.  urinary nephrin is a potential non-invasive biomarker of disease.  kidney tubular atrophy on biopsy is a strong predictor of chronic kidney disease (ckd) progression, but tubular health is poorly quantified by traditional measures including estimated glomerular filtration rate (egfr) and albuminuria.  renal interstitial fibrosis and arterial lesions predict loss of function in chronic kidney disease.  urinary proteomics is a promising method, but more studies focusing on progression rate and patients with hypertensive nephropathy are needed.  biomarkers of early stage ckd and prognostic biomarkers are required.  chronic kidney disease (ckd) is an increasing clinical problem.  urinary cystatin c (u-cysc) is a new biomarker for acute tubular kidney dysfunction and may also indicate chronic tubular dysfunction.  protein:creatinine ratio in spot morning urine samples is a precise indicator of proteinuria and a reliable predictor of progression of disease in non-diabetic patients with chronic nephropathies and represents a simple and inexpensive procedure in establishing severity of renal disease and prognosis.  in conclusion, these results suggest that urinary nephrin-to-creatinine ratio level is a useful and reliable biomarker for predicting the amelioration of podocyte dysfunction by candidate drugs in various kidney disease models with podocyte dysfunction.  although clinical risk factors and biomarkers for the development and progression of ckd have been identified, there is no commercial surveillance technology to definitively diagnose and quantify the severity and progressive loss of glomerular filtration rate (gfr) in ckd.  we review the major findings in urinary proteomics in ckd during the last five years. ||| ",yes
Are there canonical marks of active chromatin in developmentally regulated genes?,"our results support a model in which chromatin marking is associated with the stable production of rna, whereas unmarked chromatin would permit rapid gene activation and deactivation during development.  there is growing evidence that genes that respond to environmental or developmental signals may possess distinct chromatin marks.  combinatorial associations between distinct chromatin domains, namely promoters and cis-regulatory elements, determine transcriptional status.  measurements of accessible chromatin are used extensively to identify genomic regulatory elements.  previous studies showed that different categories of active regulatory elements are in regions of open chromatin, and each category is associated with a specific subset of post-translationally marked histones.  specific chromatin characteristics, especially the modification status of the core histone proteins, are associated with active and inactive genes.  in the latter case, regulation by transcription factors would have a comparatively more important regulatory role than chromatin marks.  transcriptional activation or repression of developmentally regulated genes is often accomplished through tissue-specific chromatin architecture and dynamic localization between active transcription factories and repressive polycomb bodies.  these results suggest that the majority of inducible genes are primed for activation by having an active chromatin signature and promoter pol ii with or without ongoing elongation.  conversely, strong chromatin marking is related to transcriptional and post-transcriptional stability, an association that we also observe in mammals.  with chromatin accessibility facilitating transcription factor access to dna, the identification of regions of open chromatin sheds light both on the function of the regulatory elements and their evolution, thus allowing the recognition of potential cres.  the dramatic changes in gene expression required for development necessitate the establishment of cis-regulatory modules defined by regions of accessible chromatin.  gene activity in eukaryotes is in part regulated at the level of chromatin through the assembly of local chromatin states that are more or less permissive to transcription.  using h3k27ac and open chromatin profiles, we showed that 89% of immature mk (imk)-specific active regulatory regions are present in the most primitive hematopoietic cells, 46% of which contain active enhancer marks.  in this review, we summarize the mechanisms of transition between transcriptional status of developmental regulators, including complex processes for enhancer activation and promoter-enhancer association.  here i review recent discoveries that improve our understanding of the influence of chromatin structure on gene expression and i discuss their relevance to mechanisms of vertebrate development.  recent studies using mammalian cells showed that a chromatin state signature is associated with active developmental enhancers, defined by high levels of histone h3 lysine 27 acetylation (h3k27ac) and strong depletion of h3k27 trimethylation (h3k27me3).  the recruitment of chromatin regulators and the assignment of chromatin states to specific genomic loci are pivotal to cell fate decisions and tissue and organ formation during development.  in addition, we identified a subgroup of genes with active promoter chromatin marks and promoter pol ii but no evidence of elongation.  transcription factors control gene expression programs in the context of the chromatin structure of their target genes. ||| ",no
Are there clinical trials on stem cells in multiple sclerosis,"the mesenchymal stem cells in multiple sclerosis (mscims) trial tests the safety and feasibility of treatment with a candidate cell-based therapy, and will inform the wider challenge of designing early phase clinical trials to evaluate putative neuroprotective therapies in progressive ms.  this article provides an overview of the current knowledge relating to the potential use of transplanted stem cells in the treatment of patients with multiple sclerosis (ms).  stem cells offer the potential for regeneration of lost tissue in neurological disease, including multiple sclerosis (ms).  in the last decade several studies employing stem cells-based therapies have been investigated as an optional treatment for multiple sclerosis.  cell-based therapies for multiple sclerosis (ms), including those employing autologous bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (msc) are being examined in clinical trials.  stem cell transplantation approaches offer for the first time the opportunity to design therapeutic approaches for multiple sclerosis (ms) with curative intent.  to determine the feasibility of culture-expanding multiple sclerosis patients' mesenchymal stem cells for clinical use.  their development in vitro and their use in vivo in animal models of degenerative neurological disease and recent first efforts in human clinical trials were the topics of a recent international meeting sponsored by the multiple sclerosis international federation and the national multiple sclerosis society on ""stem cells & ms: prospects and strategies"" participants reviewed the current state of knowledge about the potential use of stem and progenitor cells in ms and other degenerative neurological disorders and outlined a series of urgent fundamental and applied clinical research priorities that should allow the potential of regeneration of damaged tissue in ms to be assessed and pursued.  recent studies have investigated the potential of autologous bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (mscs) as a therapy for multiple sclerosis.  published experience of culture-expanding multiple sclerosis patients' mesenchymal stem cells for clinical trials is limited.  mesenchymal stem cells (mscs) have emerged as a potentially powerful cellular therapy for autoimmune diseases including multiple sclerosis (ms).  multiple sclerosis is an inflammatory, neurodegenerative disease of the central nervous system for which therapeutic mesenchymal stem cell transplantation is under study.  there is currently great interest in the use of mesenchymal stem cells as a therapy for multiple sclerosis with potential to both ameliorate inflammatory processes as well as improve regeneration and repair.  in recent years, in the effort to find a potential innovative therapy for multiple sclerosis (ms), researchers focused on transplantation of mesenchymal stem cells (mscs) due to their well-recognized ability to suppress inflammatory/autoimmune responses and exert neuroregenerative properties.  bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (bm-mscs) are an attractive cell based therapy in the treatment of cns demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis (ms).  in this case report we present the treatment of aggressive multiple sclerosis with multiple allogenic human umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cell and autologous bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells over a 4 y period.  moreover, we propose that unconventional sources of stem cells, which show characteristics similar to that of bm-mscs, and being less invasive for removal, could be considered an excellent alternative to bm-mscs and thus could be a promising innovative approach for ms treatment.  to date, several encouraging results were obtained mainly from the use of mscs derived from the bone marrow (bm-mscs) in experimental models of ms as well as in clinical trials.  the potential of autologous cell-based therapies including those using multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (mscs) is being investigated for multiple sclerosis (ms) and other neurological conditions.  in a phase i trial, autologous, bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells were isolated from 25 trial participants with multiple sclerosis and eight matched controls, and culture-expanded to a target single dose of 1-2 × 106 cells/kg. ||| ",yes
Are there clinical trials using stem cells for the treatment of cardiac disease?,"a large number of clinical trials have shown stem cell therapy to be a promising therapeutic approach for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases.  clinical and basic scientific studies of stem cell-based therapies have shown promising results for cardiovascular diseases.  cardiovascular disease is a major target for numerous experimental stem (progenitor) cell-based therapies.  stem cell therapy for the prevention and treatment of cardiac dysfunction holds significant promise for patients with ischemic heart disease.  initial clinical trials in patients with myocardial infarction document improved cardiac performance after administration of stem cells, translating their regenerative potential from the bench to the bedside.  in this review, we will give an overview of the recent developments in stem cell engineering with the goal to facilitate stem cell delivery and to promote their cardiac regenerative activity.  stem cell transplantation offers a promising treatment for heart failure.  an increasing number of clinical trials are enrolling patients in studies designed to examine the safety and efficacy of autologous stem cells for cardiac repair.  stem cell therapy for cardiac disease is a rapidly evolving field.  here, we discuss recent advances in the exciting fields of stem cells and cardiovascular disease.  good candidates are the so-called cardiac stem cells (cscs).  a major research focus in the field of cardiovascular medicine is the prospect of using stem cells and progenitor cells for cardiac regeneration.  this review highlights new developments that will benefit long-term cardiomyocyte survival and function of human cardiovascular progenitors as a prelude to achieving clinically significant outcomes in stem cell therapies for cardiac repair.  the application of novel cell therapeutics for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases could potentially achieve the ambitious aim of effective cardiac regeneration.  stem cell therapy is one of the most promising therapeutic innovations to help restore cardiac structure and function after ischemic insults to the heart.  stem cells have emerged as a next-generation therapy for cardiovascular disease.  stem cell therapy has emerged as a promising approach to improve healing of the infarcted myocardium, to treat or prevent cardiac failure, and to restore lost cardiac function.  the capability of adult tissue-derived stem cells for cardiogenesis has been extensively studied in experimental animals and clinical studies for treatment of postischemic cardiomyopathy.  stem cell transplantation is currently generating a significant interest for use in the future treatment of cardiovascular diseases.  the effects of cell therapy on heart regeneration in patients with chronic cardiomyopathy have been assessed in several clinical trials. ||| ",yes
Are there conserved noncoding elements identified between genomes of human and teleosts?,"deeply conserved elements shared between humans and teleost fish predominantly flank genes active during morphogenesis and are enriched for positive transcriptional regulatory elements.  multi-species conserved non-coding elements occur in the vertebrate genome and are clustered in the vicinity of developmentally regulated genes.  conserved and ultra-conserved non-genic sequence elements (cngs, uces) between human and other mammalian genomes seem to constitute a heterogeneous group of functional sequences which likely have important biological function.  the human genome contains thousands of non-coding sequences that are often more conserved between vertebrate species than protein-coding exons.  we searched for conserved non-coding elements (cnes) at 13 human gene loci and identified lamprey elements associated with all but two of these gene regions.  highly conserved noncoding elements (cnes) constitute a significant proportion of the genomes of multicellular eukaryotes.  vertebrate genomes share numerous conserved non-coding elements, many of which function as enhancer elements and are hypothesised to be under evolutionary constraint due to a need to be bound by combinations of sequence-specific transcription factors.  however, such deeply conserved elements account for <1% of the conserved non-coding sequences in the human genome, which are predominantly mammalian.  comparative genomics has revealed a class of non-protein-coding genomic sequences that display an extraordinary degree of conservation between two or more organisms, regularly exceeding that found within protein-coding exons.  here, we used the ucsc alignment of the human genome against those of 11 mammalian and five nonmammalian vertebrates to identify and examine the extent of conservation of human microsatellites in vertebrate genomes.  in contrast, few such conserved elements can be detected between vertebrates and their closest invertebrate relatives.  cross-species dna sequence comparison is the primary method used to identify functional noncoding elements in human and other large genomes.  evolutionary conservation of noncoding sequences across diverse species may have functional significance, and these conserved sequences may be good candidates for regulatory elements.  conserved non-coding sequences in the human genome are approximately tenfold more abundant than known genes, and have been hypothesized to mark the locations of cis-regulatory elements.  a phylogenetic footprinting strategy was employed to identify noncoding conservation patterns of 39 human and bovine orthologous genes.  here, we searched for duplicated conserved noncoding elements in the human genome, using comparisons with fugu to select putative cis-regulatory sequences.  our results suggest genetic variation in (ultra-)conserved non-genic sequence elements which might alter functional properties.  several studies have demonstrated high levels of sequence conservation in noncoding dna compared between two species (e.g., human and mouse), and interpreted this conservation as evidence for functional constraints.  fish-mammal genomic comparisons have proved powerful in identifying conserved noncoding elements likely to be cis-regulatory in nature, and the majority of those tested in vivo have been shown to act as tissue-specific enhancers associated with genes involved in transcriptional regulation of development.  we identified 124 families of duplicated elements, each containing between two and five members, that are highly conserved within and between vertebrate genomes. ||| ",yes
Are there currently applications of deep learning in genomics?,"in the past decade, numerous genomics studies have adopted deep learning and its applications range from predicting regulatory elements to cancer classification.  genomic research could be the next frontier to take advantage of deep learning, as it has the perfect combination of vast amounts of data and diverse tasks.  here, we provide a perspective and primer on deep learning applications for genome analysis.  given the growing trend on the application of deep learning architectures in genomics research, in this mini review we outline the most prominent models, we highlight possible pitfalls and discuss future directions.  application of deep learning to genomic datasets is an exciting area that is rapidly developing and is primed to revolutionize genome analysis.  we embrace the potential that deep learning holds for understanding genome biology, and we encourage further advances in this area, extending to all aspects of genomics research.  one such data-driven science to be transformed by deep learning is genomics.  in recent years, numerous applications have demonstrated the potential of deep learning for an improved understanding of biological processes.  in this context, deep learning is re-emerging as a possible approach to speed up the dna sequencing process.  with the advances of the big data era in biology, it is foreseeable that deep learning will become increasingly important in the field and will be incorporated in vast majorities of analysis pipelines.  we start from the recent achievements of deep learning in the bioinformatics field, pointing out the problems which are suitable to use deep learning.  overall, we believe genomic research is the next frontline for deep learning as there are exciting avenues waiting to be explored.  in this review, we provide both the exoteric introduction of deep learning, and concrete examples and implementations of its representative applications in bioinformatics.  deep learning is beginning to impact biological research and biomedical applications as a result of its ability to integrate vast datasets, learn arbitrarily complex relationships and incorporate existing knowledge.  we foresee deep learning accelerating changes in the area of genomics, especially for multi-scale and multimodal data analysis for precision medicine.  deep learning has revolutionized research in image processing, speech recognition, natural language processing, game playing, and will soon revolutionize research in proteomics and genomics.  advances in deep learning created an unprecedented momentum in biomedical informatics and have given rise to new bioinformatics and computational biology research areas.  since genomics produce big data, most of the bioinformatics algorithms are based on machine learning methodologies, and lately deep learning, to identify patterns, make predictions and model the progression or treatment of a disease.  deep learning, which is especially formidable in handling big data, has achieved great success in various fields, including bioinformatics.  deep learning is ideally suited for biological problems that require automatic or hierarchical feature representation for biological data when prior knowledge is limited. ||| ",yes
Are there enhancer RNAs (eRNAs)?,"enhancer rnas (ernas) are a class of non-coding rnas transcribed from enhancers.  enhancer rnas (ernas) are a novel class of non-coding rna (ncrna) molecules transcribed from the dna sequences of enhancer regions.  enhancer rnas (ernas) are a class of long noncoding rnas (lncrna) expressed from active enhancers, whose function and action mechanism are yet to be firmly established.  enhancer rnas (ernas) are a subset of long noncoding rna generated from genomic enhancers: they are thought to act as potent promoters of the expression of nearby genes through interaction with the transcriptional and epigenomic machineries.  recent studies have revealed that active enhancers are transcribed, producing a class of noncoding rnas called enhancer rnas (ernas).  enhancer-derived rnas (ernas) are a group of rnas transcribed by rna polymerase ii from the domain of transcription enhancers, a major type of cis-regulatory elements in the genome.  recent studies have disclosed the function of enhancer rnas (ernas), which are long non-coding rnas transcribed from gene enhancer regions, in transcriptional regulation.  since the discovery that many transcriptional enhancers are transcribed into long noncoding rnas termed ""enhancer rnas"" (ernas), their putative role in enhancer function has been debated.  recent studies reveal that enhancer regions are transcribed to produce a class of noncoding rnas referred to as enhancer rnas (ernas).  however, recent studies have shown that enhancers are transcribed and that these transcripts, called enhancer rnas (ernas), have a regulatory function.  emerging evidence has shown that active enhancers are abundantly transcribed, generating long non-coding rnas, called enhancer rnas (ernas).  emerging studies, showing that ernas function in controlling mrna transcription, challenge the idea that enhancers are merely sites of transcription factor assembly.  active enhancers generate bi-directional non-coding rna transcripts called enhancer rnas (ernas).  enhancers generate bidirectional noncoding enhancer rnas (ernas) that may regulate gene expression.  a subset of enhancers are occupied by rna polymerase ii (rnap ii) and transcribed to produce long non-coding rnas termed ernas.  recent studies have identified bi-directionally transcribed rnas emanating from these enhancers known as ernas.  enhancers are cis-acting elements that control the transcription of target genes and are transcribed into a class of noncoding rnas (ncrnas) termed enhancer rnas (ernas).  as the markers of active enhancers, ernas play important roles in gene regulation and are associated with various complex traits and characteristics.  the correlation between erna production and enhancer activity has stimulated studies on the potential role of ernas in transcriptional regulation.  growing evidence has suggested that enhancer rnas (ernas), a set of long non-coding rnas (lncrnas) that were derived from active enhancer regions, play critical roles in regulating gene expression in human cancers. ||| ",yes
Are there focused databases from which you can retrieve gene expression data on renal disease?,"we present a bioinformatics database named renal gene expression database (rged), which contains comprehensive gene expression data sets from renal disease research.  the aim of this work is to provide a user-friendly utility for the renal disease research community to query expression profiles of genes of their own interest without the requirement of advanced computational skills.  for renal disease, the availability of both tissue- and disease-specific expression data makes the strategy a compelling option.  we present kgdb, which is to our knowledge the first curated and integrated database of genes involved in human kidney disease.  databases which are useful for proteomic analysis of human kidney tissue and urine have been discussed in this article.  the information may serve as a resource for speeding up the discovery of genes underlying human renal disease.  genes that undergo molecular, genetic or epigenetic events that affect kidney function are identified through a biomedical literature search and catalogued in the database.  integration of the gene-centric and protein-centric general databases with those of human kidney tissue and urine proteomes may open a new window for research in nephrology.  due to recent advances in high-throughput techniques, we and others have generated multiple proteomic and transcriptomic databases to describe and quantify gene expression, protein abundance, or cellular signaling on the scale of the whole genome/proteome in kidney cells.  we have created a curated and integrated database, the kidney gene database (kgdb) (http://www.urogene.org/kgdb) that contains current information about genes or genomic loci involved in human kidney disease.  the web-based interface of rged allows users to query the gene expression profiles in various kidney-related samples, including renal cell lines, human kidney tissues and murine model kidneys.  profiling of gene expression in healthy and diseased renal tissue is important for elucidating the pathogenesis of renal diseases.  comprehensive information about the genes expressed in renal tissue is unavailable.  a huge array of data in nephrology is collected through patient registries, large epidemiological studies, electronic health records, administrative claims, clinical trial repositories, mobile health devices and molecular databases.  administrative health care databases offer an efficient and accessible, though as-yet unvalidated, approach to studying outcomes of patients with chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease (esrd).  bulk or whole tissue analysis of patient kidney samples identified a large number of genes, whose levels correlate with kidney function and/or structural damage.  to test molecular based renal disease categorization, differential gene expression profiles were compared between control and hydronephrotic kidneys showing varying degrees of inflammation and fibrosis.  the recently developed cdna array hybridization methodology allows simultaneous monitoring of thousands of genes expressed renal tissue.  by comparing such databases between the healthy and diseased populations, we may be able to identify the following: proteins involved in the development of renal disease, proteins involved in progression of ckd, or new biomarker candidate proteins for either the development of renal disease or the progression of ckd.  the presented data constitute a comprehensive preliminary transcriptional map of the adult human renal cortex. ||| ",yes
Are there interactomes available for POU5F1 and SOX2?,"recently, many examples of the involvement of sox-pou partnerships in transcription have been discovered, including a partnership between sox-2 and oct-3.  the importance of interactions between sox and pou transcription factors in the regulation of gene expression is becoming increasingly apparent.  members of the pou and sox transcription factor families exemplify the partnerships established between various transcriptional regulators during early embryonic development.  the genes pou5f1 and sox2 are critical for pluripotency and reprogramming, yet the chromosomal organization around these genes remains poorly understood.  sox2, pou5f1, and fgf4 are key molecules for the integrome network in oncology and stem cell biology.  in this report, we identify oct-1, encoded by the pou2f1 gene, as a co-factor for sox2 in the context of mouse lens and nasal placode induction.  specific examples include the sox2-oct3/4 pairing in es cells and the sox2-pax6 pairing in visual system primordia.  sox2 and pou5f1 (oct3 or oct4) transcription factors are implicated in fgf4 expression in embryonic stem (es) cells.  we assayed long-range chromosomal interactions on putative enhancers of pou5f1 and sox2 genes in human embryonic stem cells (hescs) using 4c-seq technique.  genetic combination of sox2 and pou2f1 mutant alleles results in impaired induction of the lens placode, an ocular phenotype that includes anophthalmia, and a complete failure of nasal placode induction.  the mutant has lost its ability to interact with oct4, but remains competent to interact with wild-type sox2.  collectively, these results indicate that pou2f1, sox2 and pax6 are interdependent components of a molecular pathway utilized in both lens and nasal placode induction.  additionally, some genes associated with the pou5f1 enhancer contribute to pluripotency.  two major molecular mechanisms underlie sox-partner factor interactions: (1) cooperative dna binding; and (2) protein interactions dependent upon dna binding which elicit a large transactivation potential.  sox9, tcf/lef, pou2f1 and comp1 binding sites were conserved among human sox2 promoter, rat sox2 promoter, and mouse sox2 promoter.  sox2 plays an important role in early embryogenesis by cooperating with oct4 in regulating gene expression in fertilized eggs, yet the precise mechanism through which sox2 accomplishes this important function remains poorly understood.  sox2 mediates its transcriptional effects through the formation of complexes with specific co-factors, many of which are unknown.  we used the quantitative and scalable cooperativity-by-sequencing (coop-seq) approach to interrogate sox2/pax6 dimerization on a dna library where five positions of the pax6 half-site were randomized yielding 1024 cooperativity factors.  this is the first report on comparative integromics analyses on the sox2 orthologs.  together, these data reveal that sox2 employs a high-affinity/low-specificity paradigm for rna binding in vitro and in vivo. ||| ",yes
Are there mammalian promoters with distal enhancer functions?,"in the human genome, distal enhancers are involved in regulating target genes through proximal promoters by forming enhancer-promoter interactions.  distal regulatory elements, including enhancers, play a critical role in regulating gene activity.  mammalian gene regulation is often mediated by distal enhancer elements, in particular, for tissue specific and developmental genes.  gene expression in mammals is precisely regulated by the combination of promoters and gene-distal regulatory regions, known as enhancers.  several studies have suggested that some promoters might have enhancer functions.  here, by exploiting a high-throughput enhancer reporter assay, we unravel a set of mammalian promoters displaying enhancer activity.  our previous results demonstrated that a subset of gene promoters, termed epromoters, work as bona fide enhancers and regulate distal gene expression.  enhancers are distal regulatory elements that can activate tissue-specific gene expression and are abundant throughout mammalian genomes.  gene expression is controlled by the involvement of gene-proximal (promoters) and distal (enhancers) regulatory elements.  however, the extent of this type of promoters and whether they actually function to regulate the expression of distal genes have remained elusive.  we note differences among four tested enhancers in their ability to regulate a distally placed reporter transgene.  enhancers are traditionally viewed as dna sequences located some distance from a promoter that act in cis and in an orientation-independent fashion to increase utilization of specific promoters and thereby regulate gene expression.  enhancers and promoters, cis-acting regulators of mammalian gene expression, are modular units containing multiple short binding sites for specific trans-acting transcription factors.  some enhancers (mainly bidirectional) can act as weak promoters, producing overlapping spatio-temporal expression.  these elements typically reside distal to their target promoter, with which they must interact selectively.  both enhancers and promoters are composed of multiple binding sites for transcription factors.  a distal transcriptional enhancer has been previously reported upstream of the mouse renin gene.  these results suggest that enhancers differ in their requirements for promoter interaction and raise important practical considerations when studying enhancer function.  gene transcription in animals involves the assembly of rna polymerase ii at core promoters and its cell-type-specific activation by enhancers that can be located more distally.  enhancers activate gene transcription in spatial and temporal patterns by interactions with gene promoters. ||| ",yes
Are there methods for generating highly multiplexed ChIP-seq libraries?,"here, we describe a novel method to analyze such data that intelligently uses the joint information from multiple related chip-seq libraries.  although there are a number of methods available for single chip-seq data analysis (e.g.  however, frequently multiple chip-seq libraries derived from differing cell lines or tissue types from the same individual may be available.  the widespread application of chip-seq led to a growing need for consistent analysis of multiple epigenetics profiles, for instance, in human studies where multiple replicates are a common element of design.  while numerous algorithms have recently been proposed for analysing the large chip-seq datasets, their relative merits and potential limitations remain unclear in practical applications.  here we describe a nano-chip-seq protocol that combines a high-sensitivity small-scale chip assay and a tailored procedure for generating high-throughput sequencing libraries from scarce amounts of chip dna.  here, we describe how to perform chip-seq starting with whole tissues or cell lines, and ending with millions of short sequencing tags that can be aligned to the reference genome of the species under investigation.  we describe a new method for chip-seq sample preparation, termed lobchip, where the library reactions are performed on cross-linked chip fragments captured on beads.  we also outline additional procedures to recover chip-chip libraries for chip-seq and discuss contemporary issues in data analysis.  chip-seq is the method of choice for genome-wide studies of protein-dna interactions.  current chip-seq studies are interested in comparing multiple epigenetic profiles across several cell types and tissues simultaneously for studying constitutive and differential regulation.  chip-seq is the primary technique used to investigate genome-wide protein-dna interactions.  chip-seq is a powerful technology to measure the protein binding or histone modification strength in the whole genome scale.  chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by massively parallel, high throughput sequencing (chip-seq) is the method of choice for genome-wide identification of dna segments bound by specific transcription factors or in chromatin with particular histone modifications.  chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with massively parallel sequencing (chip-seq) is increasingly being applied to study transcriptional regulation on a genome-wide scale.  although a variety of methods exist for analysis of the established alternative chip microarray (chip-chip), few approaches have been described for processing chip-seq data.  we leveraged these findings to produce a set of ctcf chip-seq datasets in rare, primary hematopoietic progenitor cells.  however, conventional chip protocols necessitate the use of large numbers of cells, and library preparation steps associated with current high-throughput sequencing platforms require substantial amounts of dna; both of these factors preclude the application of chip-seq technology to many biologically important but rare cell types.  chip-seq is becoming the main approach to the genome-wide study of protein-dna interactions and histone modifications.  these approaches were integrated in a general-purpose framework, named ccat (control-based chip-seq analysis tool), for the significance analysis of chip-seq. ||| ",yes
Are there plasma membrane receptors for thyroid hormones?,"recent identification of membrane receptors for t4, t3, 3,5-t2, and 3-iodothyronamine that mediate rapid physiologic effects of thyroid hormones suggested that such receptors may supplement the regulation of trh and trh-like peptides by nuclear t3 receptors.  the nongenomic actions of thyroid hormone begin at receptors in the plasma membrane, mitochondria or cytoplasm.  the actions of such hormones are mediated by specific thyroid hormone receptors (trs).  although the biological effects of thyroid hormones are mediated by nuclear receptors (genomic mechanisms), interactions with receptors associated with the plasma membrane (non-genomic mechanisms) of target cells are not clear.  the binding characteristics of thyroxine (t4), triiodothyronine (t3), and reverse t3 (rt3) to rat liver plasma membranes (rlpm) were examined to explore the interactions of thyroid hormones with cell surface receptors.  thyroid hormone receptors (trs) are nuclear receptors that are activated by thyroid hormone ligands and co-regulator proteins.  as a prerequisite to studies of whether the plasma membrane of the rat thymocyte contains specific, saturable binding sites for the thyroid hormone 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (t(3)), a method was developed for the isolation of a plasma membrane fraction from these cells.  thyroid hormone receptors (tr) are members of the nuclear receptor superfamily.  there is increasing evidence that the membrane-bound thyrotropin receptor (tshr) may be mediating clinically important direct effects of thyrotropin (tsh) and of tshr antibodies (tshrab) in extra-thyroidal tissues.  the fact that the thyroid gland of graves' patients has a normal density of tsh receptors with suppressed tsh and high t4 and t3 levels suggests a modulatory role of thyroid hormones on tsh receptors.  these receptors can share structural homologies with nuclear thyroid hormone receptors (trs) that mediate transcriptional actions of t3, or have no homologies with tr, such as the plasma membrane receptor on integrin αvβ3.  biological responses to thyroid hormones are mediated by the nuclear thyroid hormone receptor (tr).  thyroid hormones exert their effects by stimulation of thyroid hormone receptors that have different tissue distribution and metabolic targets.  before the discovery of these nuclear receptors, possible major binding sites for thyroid hormones were thought to be cytosolic owing to high thyroid hormone-binding activity in crude cytosolic fractions.  thyroid hormone action is initiated through nuclear thyroid hormone receptors (trs).  the trh binding sites were absent in the adenomas associated with high levels of circulating thyroid hormones, whereas they were present in the adenoma secondary to primary thyroid failure (kd = 47 nmol/l, bmax = 40 nmol/kg membrane proteins).  the results show that the levels of the trh-like peptides in rat thyroid are highly sensitive to thyroid status, suggesting a possible involvement in thyroid regulation.  rat thyroid contains thyrotropin-releasing hormone (trh) and trh-like peptides which react with trh antisera.  there are at least two tr isoforms, tralpha and trbeta, which act as mediators of thyroid hormone in tissues.  the mean concentration of trh-like peptides in the thyroids of the hyperthyroid rats was 95.5+/-25.5 pmol/g, the mean concentration in the hypothyroid rats was 11.7+/-3.4 pmol/g, and in the euthyroid rats 17.6+/-3.2 pmol/g. ||| ",yes
Are there randomised controlled trials on sevoflurane?,"we performed a double-blinded, prospective, randomized controlled trial to compare intubating conditions facilitated by succinylcholine or sevoflurane.  sevoflurane increases cbf and decreases cvr in a dose-dependent manner.  sevoflurane is a volatile anesthetic that is chemically similar to volatile substances of abuse and can be safely administered to humans in laboratory research.  major databases were systematically searched for randomized controlled trials (rcts) comparing volatile anesthetics (isoflurane versus sevoflurane) in cardiac surgery.  previously it has been reported that at clinically used doses of sevoflurane, cerebral vasoreactivity is maintained.  in this study, the reinforcing and subjective effects of five concentrations of sevoflurane (0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8% sevoflurane in o2) were studied in 20 non-drug-abusers.  sevoflurane is one of the most frequently used inhaled anesthetics for general anesthesia.  sevoflurane showed a tendency to lower heart rates and cardiac index compared with isoflurane.  sevoflurane is a cerebral vasodilator in patients with cerebral tumours.  this study shows that sevoflurane can function as a reinforcer and produce abuse liability-related subjective effects in some healthy volunteers.  sevoflurane is a popular inhalational anesthetic for general anesthesia in children.  a comprehensive literature search was conducted to identify clinical trials that compared the incidence of emergence agitation in children anesthetized with sevoflurane versus halothane.  studies concerning the cerebrovascular effects of sevoflurane in patients with space-occupying lesions are few.  in the doses used in this study, sevoflurane was found to be as effective as an inhalation sedation agent as the standard dose of nitrous oxide used in normal inhalation sedation in the treatment of adult anxious dental patients.  sevoflurane is widely used in anaesthetic protocols for patients undergoing surgical procedures.  one hundred twenty patients were randomized to receive either succinylcholine or sevoflurane for tracheal intubation.  this study retrospectively evaluated pooled renal laboratory data from 22 different clinical trials that compared sevoflurane with three widely used anesthetics.  to determine if sevoflurane provides comparable hemodynamics and recovery characteristics to isoflurane in cardiac anesthesia.  to determine if sevoflurane provides hemodynamic and recovery characteristics comparable to isoflurane in patients undergoing surgery for valvular heart disease.  the higher incidence of emergence agitation has been suspected after sevoflurane anesthesia as compared with halothane, whereas some controlled studies showed conflicting results. ||| ",yes
Are there sex differences in the transcriptome of the mouse hippocampus?,"sex differences in the function of the hippocampus have been observed in numerous mammalian species.  sex differences in the morphology and function of the hippocampus have been reported in several species, but it is unknown whether a sexual dimorphism exists in glial fibrillary acidic protein (gfap) expression in the rat hippocampus.  this review will discuss seminal studies examining sex differences in hippocampal memory, neuronal morphology, synaptic plasticity, and cell signaling in humans and rodents.  these findings provide an additional morphological clue for the comprehension of the sex dimorphisms within the hippocampal circuitries and, consequently, for a better understanding of the functional sex differences ascribed to the hippocampal formation.  the male rat hippocampus is consistently reported to be slightly but significantly larger than the female.  these findings are crucial to a better understanding of how sex chromosomes can influence the physiology of cultured hippocampal slices and allow us to gain insights into distinct responses of males and females on neurological diseases that present a sex-biased incidence.  in reproductively mature individuals, sex differences in the steroid hormone milieu undergirds many sex differences in hippocampal-related endpoints.  sex differences exist in the structure and function of the cholinergic septo-hippocampal system throughout the lifespan of mammals.  here, we assessed the age changes in spatial memory performance and hippocampal morphology in female rats and compared those changes with changes in the hippocampal transcriptome.  although sex differences have been reported in hippocampal-dependent learning and memory, including contextual fear memories, the underlying molecular mechanisms contributing to such differences are not well understood.  these results reveal significant biological sex difference in ventral hippocampal modulation on anxiety in mice and provide a new sight for anxiety modulation and hippocampal function.  data accumulated over the last years demonstrate that the hippocampal formation of rodents is sexually dimorphic with respect to its functional attributes.  we also describe possible organizational and activational effects of sex steroid hormones during early development, puberty, and adulthood that may lead to sex differences observed in the hippocampus.  sex differences in the brain of mammals range from neuroarchitecture through cognition to cellular metabolism.  therefore, we explored basal sex-related differences in the proteome of organotypic hippocampal slice culture, a major in vitro model for studying the cellular and molecular mechanisms related to neurodegenerative disorders.  numerous studies have suggested that sexual dimorphism may exist in learning and memory, particularly in types involving the hippocampus.  we have previously reported that in the male and female mice, steroid receptor coactivator-1 (src-1) and some key synaptic proteins share similar developmental profile in the hippocampus, but how circulating sex hormones affect hippocampal src-1 as well as these synaptic proteins remain unclear.  in general, the significant spectrum of pathways known to predominate in neurons or astrocytes, together with the well-known neuronal and glial markers observed, revealed sex-specific metabolic differences in the hippocampus.  there have been a few descriptive studies in aged rodents about transcriptome changes in the hippocampus, most of them in males.  we conclude that age-related hippocampal deficits in female rats share commonalities between human and rodents. ||| ",yes
"Are there studies representing the involvement of Notch mutations in neurodegenerative diseases such as Down syndrome, Pick's and Prion's disease, and cadasil syndrome?","on the other side, there are studies representing the involvement of notch mutations in sporadic alzheimer disease, other neurodegenerative diseases such as down syndrome, pick's and prion's disease, and cadasil.  deficits in the notch pathway are involved in a number of neurologic diseases associated with mental retardation or/and dementia.  the specific roles of notch in progressive adulthood neurodegenerative disorders have begun to be unraveled in recent years.  recently, notch receptors have been hypothesized to play a role in neurodegeneration and in particular in alzheimer's disease (notch1) and cadasil (notch3).  importantly, mutations of the notch protein and components of its signaling pathway have been implicated in an array of human diseases (t-cell leukemia and other cancers, multiple sclerosis, cadasil, alagille syndrome, spondylocostal dysostosis).  recent studies have identified notch signaling as a contributor of neurodegeneration including alzheimer's disease' (ad) pathophysiology.  these data indicate that notch signaling plays a critical role in dendrite development of immature neurons in the postnatal brain, and dysregulation of notch signaling in the postnatally born neurons disrupts their development and thus contributes to the cognitive deficits associated with neurological diseases.  this study identifies notch as a central signaling cascade capable of modulating synaptic transmission in response to excitatory insult through the activation of neuroprotective genes that have been associated to ad.  notch proteins are involved in cell fate specification during development in tissues including brain.  a number of independent studies have shown significant increases of notch expression in brains from patients at later stages of sporadic alzheimer's disease (ad).  the mechanisms by which notch dysregulation are associated with mental retardation and dementia are poorly understood.  this manuscript attempts to present a holistic view of the positive or negative contribution of notch signaling in the adult brain, and at the same time to present and promote the promising research fields of study.  notch genes are involved in embryogenesis, nervous system, and cardiovascular and endocrine function.  the notch signaling pathway is involved in a wide variety of highly conserved developmental processes in mammals.  as part of the efforts to understand molecular mechanisms and players involved in neurodegenerative dementia, we employed transgenic mouse models with notch1 and rbpjk loss of function (lof) mutation in pyramidal neurons of the ca fields.  as well, potential roles for glycosylation in notch-related human diseases, and possible roles for therapeutic targeting of pofut1 and fringe in notch-related human diseases, are discussed.  notch signaling is a master controller of the neural stem cell and neural development maintaining a significant role in the normal brain function.  recently, mutations causative for niemann-pick type c disease (npc) have also been implicated in neurodegenerative diseases.  we found that notch1 is highly expressed in the adult-born immature neurons in the hippocampus of mice.  several neurodegenerative diseases are known such as alzheimer's disease, parkinson's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and many studies on the molecular mechanisms underlying these pathologies have been conducted. ||| ",yes
Are there telemedicine applications for chronic pain management?,"a prospective pilot study was conducted on chronic pain patients requiring follow-up consultations using telemedicine technology.  this pilot study indicates that telemedicine follow-up consultations for chronic pain patients are feasible and cost-saving.  the present study was the first pilot project to determine whether telemedicine technology for chronic pain consultation was feasible, cost-saving, and satisfactory to patients and pain physicians.  this paper describes the development and evaluation of a telehealth intervention (telepain) designed to address the need for pain specialist consultation regarding pain and symptom management issues in non-academic medical centers.  there is increasing interest in the use of telemedicine to assist in the management of chronic diseases.  however, there are few data on the application of telemedicine to chronic pain patients.  given the important patient needs for support and treatment, telemedicine-defined by medical approaches supported by the new technologies of information-could provide interesting alternative in tinnitus treatment.  telehealth technologies can bridge geographic distance and improve patients' quality of care in communities where access to pain specialists has previously been unavailable.  the integration of telemedicine as a supplement to musculoskeletal-based patient encounters may be feasible in sports medicine.  this review aims to provide an overview of existing telemedicine models involving the delivery of care by pharmacists via telemedicine (including telemonitoring and video, but excluding follow-up telephone calls) and to highlight the main areas of chronic-disease management where these models have been applied.  telemedicine has been used extensively in various settings, including monitoring patient treatment response and counseling.  telemedicine refers to the use of information and communication technologies for providing health care at a distance.  telemedicine is the delivery of medical care from a distance using technology.  there is growing interest in telehealth-the use of technology to support the remote delivery of health care and promote self-management-as a potential alternative to face-to-face care for patients with chronic diseases.  clinical telemedicine uses interactive video technologies and telecommunications networks to deliver medical consultations to distant patients and their primary care providers.  whereas majority of telemedicine services today are focused on minor acute clinical ailments, the true potential of virtual care models lies in their ability to improve access to chronic condition care for medically complex individuals.  cost effective and easy to implement, telemedicine is likely to represent an important part of the future of tinnitus therapies and should be progressively integrated by otolaryngologists.  by analyzing the published tools and approaches which could be used in the context of telemedicine for tinnitus by health professionals or self-administrated by patients, this review summarizes, presents, and describes the principal telemedicine approaches available presently or in the near future to help assess or treat tinnitus or to offer support to tinnitus sufferers.  the aim of this study was to synthesize the perceptions of people with chronic musculoskeletal pain for engaging in interventions delivered using telehealth.  telemedicine is the application of modern telecommunications to the practice of medicine. ||| ",yes
Are there transposon-free regions in mammalian genomes?,"four mechanisms are presented which may explain the nonrandom genomic distribution of mammalian transposons: i) sequence-specific insertion, ii) s-phase insertion, iii) ectopic excision, and iv) recombinational editing.  all mammalian transposable elements characterized to date appear to be nonrandomly distributed in the mammalian genome.  mammalian genomes are littered with enormous numbers of transposable elements interspersed within and between single-copy endogenous genes.  our results are consistent with the hypothesis that transposon rnas frequently originate within genomic te units and do not primarily accumulate as a consequence of random 'read-through' from gene promoters.  mammalian genomes are comprised of 30-50% transposed elements (tes).  comprising nearly half of the human and mouse genomes, transposable elements (tes) are found within most genes.  although many of these elements are defective, a number of mammalian non-ltr retrotransposons of the l1 type are capable of autonomous retrotransposition.  mammalian genomes contain hundreds of thousands of non-ltr retrotransposon copies, mostly resulting from the amplification of a single clade known as l1.  mammalian genomes are repositories of repetitive dna sequences derived from transposable elements (tes).  to characterize the contribution of transposons to mammalian transcriptomes, we developed a custom microarray platform with probes covering known human and mouse transposons in both sense and antisense orientations.  mammalian genomes contain highly conserved sequences that are not functionally transcribed.  transposable elements (tes) are mobile genetic elements that make up a large fraction of mammalian genomes.  the only presently spreading class of human transposable elements comprises non-ltr (long terminal repeat) retrotransposons, which cover approx.  only 5-6% of mammalian genomes are genes; the remainders are made up primarily of transposable elements and different types of simple sequence repeat (ssrs) (micro- and minisatellites and cryptic repeats), which tend to accumulate in organisms with larger genomes.  the vast majority of these tes are truncated and mutated fragments of retrotransposons that are no longer capable of transposition.  recent insertions of ltr-retrotransposons, non-ltr retrotransposons, and non-autonomous retrotransposons have caused disease frequently in mice, but infrequently in humans.  the long interspersed nuclear element (line-1) (l1) clade of non-ltr retrotransposons has been particularly successful in mammals, accounting for 30-40% of human genome sequence.  the genomes of teleost fish and squamate reptiles contain a much more diverse array of non-ltr retrotransposon families, whereas copy number is relatively low.  although transposable element (te) derived dna accounts for more than half of mammalian genomes and initiates a significant proportion of rna transcripts, high throughput methods are rarely leveraged specifically to detect expression from interspersed repeats.  more than half the human and mouse genomes are comprised of repetitive sequences, such as transposable elements (tes), which have been implicated in many biological processes. ||| ",yes
Are there ultraconserved genomic regions in the budding yeast?,"fundamental aspects of eukaryotic molecular and cellular biology are extensively studied in the budding yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae.  genome maintenance pathways are highly conserved and research into a number of human genetic disorders with increased genome instability and cancer predisposition have benefited greatly from studies in budding yeast.  budding yeasts inhabit a range of environments by exploiting various metabolic traits.  the genome sequence of the budding yeast, saccharomyces cerevisiae, with a small genome size, unicellular growth, and rich history of genetic and molecular analyses was a milestone of early genomics in the 1990s.  the availability of genome sequences for a series of closely related (sensu stricto) budding yeasts has allowed us to take a 'comparative genomics' approach to this problem.  research on the budding yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae has yielded fundamental discoveries on highly conserved biological pathways and yeast remains the best-studied eukaryotic cell in the world.  we have studied the evolution of the yeast ribosomal dna unit to search for regions outside the rrna genes that exhibit evolutionary constraints and therefore might be involved in control of ribosome biosynthesis.  many aspects of the genomes of yeast species in the family saccharomycetaceae have been well conserved during evolution.  here we report on a marked telomeric sequence diversity within the budding yeast genus saccharomyces.  since they represent functional protein-binding sites, origin sequences are conserved better than the surrounding intergenic sequence within the genomes of closely related yeasts.  the budding yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae is a long-standing model for the three-dimensional organization of eukaryotic genomes.  our results indicate that different clades coexist at fine spatial scale and that population structure persists over at least a one-year interval in these wild yeasts, suggesting the efficacy of yearly sampling to follow longer term genetic dynamics in future studies.  here we performed an integrated approach of genome wide expression profiles of yeast at different time points, during growth and starvation.  a yeast gene usually have at most one intron.  we conducted an extensive analysis of the yeast genome to try to answer these questions.  past analyses of the genome of the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae have revealed substantial regional variation in g+c content.  to help understand the molecular evolution of these traits in yeasts, we created analyzing yeasts by reconstructing ancestry of homologs (aybrah), an open-source database of predicted and manually curated ortholog groups for 33 diverse fungi and yeasts in dikarya, spanning 600 million years of evolution.  here, we performed high-throughput chromosome conformation capture on diverged saccharomyces hybrid diploids to obtain the first global view of chromosome conformation in diploid yeasts.  in addition, we found ste12, xbp1 and tos8 as highly connected nodes in the subnetworks of ageing yeast.  the genome sequences provide a first glimpse into the genomic basis of the biological diversity of filamentous fungi and yeast. ||| ",yes
Are there ways of joint Bayesian inference of risk variants?,"working within the multivariate linear regression framework helps us to account for the joint effects of multiple genes; and adopting a bayesian approach leads to posterior probabilities that coherently incorporate all information about the variants' function.  here we develop and evaluate a bayesian hierarchical regression method that incorporates prior information on the likelihood of variant causality through weighting of variant effects.  standard statistical approaches for prioritization of variants for functional testing in fine-mapping studies either use marginal association statistics or estimate posterior probabilities for variants to be causal under simplifying assumptions.  bayesian statistical methods have recently made great inroads into many areas of science, and this advance is now extending to the assessment of association between genetic variants and disease or other phenotypes.  bayesian approaches can model multiple variables together and offer advantages over conventional model building strategies, including using existing biological evidence as modeling priors and acknowledging that many models may fit the data well.  we describe two novel prior distributions that facilitate learning the role of each variable site by borrowing evidence across phenotypes and across mutations in the same gene.  for genome-wide association studies with family-based designs, we propose a bayesian approach.  we developed a likelihood-based approach for analyzing summary-level statistics and external linkage disequilibrium information to estimate effect-size distributions of common variants, characterized by the proportion of underlying susceptibility snps and a flexible normal-mixture model for their effects.  accordingly, we project the risk-prediction ability of polygenic risk scores across a wide variety of diseases.  we devise efficient algorithms that estimate the parameters of our model across all risk loci to further increase performance.  probabilistic risk analyses often construct multistage chance trees to estimate the joint probability of compound events.  a key feature of our approach is that it empirically estimates the contribution of each functional annotation to the trait of interest directly from summary association statistics while allowing for multiple causal variants at any risk locus.  assuming that prior information varies over some classes of priors, we develop the concept of robust bayes estimation into the context of allele frequency estimation.  bayesian models for genomic prediction and association mapping are being increasingly used in genetics analysis of quantitative traits.  through the use of an informative prior, bayesian methodologies could potentially borrow the strength of historical information and become more and more popular for their applications to clinical trials.  we show that standard transmission disequilibrium test and family-based association test statistics can naturally be implemented in a bayesian framework, allowing flexible specification of the likelihood and prior odds.  to allow for uncertainties in parameter values, one may employ bayesian techniques or, in a maximum-likelihood framework, construct a support interval (si) for the risk.  here, we present a probabilistic framework that integrates association strength with functional genomic annotation data to improve accuracy in selecting plausible causal variants for functional validation.  we introduced an extremely flexible analysis framework capable of efficiently performing bayesian variable selection on many candidate variables.  we first assume that the region of interest is a single locus and the prior information is represented in terms of a class of beta distributions, and present explicit forms of the resulting bayes and robust bayes estimators. ||| ",yes
Are there web based self management strategies for chronic pain ?,"internet-based interventions using cognitive behavioral approaches can be effective in promoting self-management of chronic pain conditions.  a web-based pain management programme can be clinically effective and may be a useful addition to the treatments offered by pain management services.  web-based interventions may also be effective in enhancing self-management for individuals with chronic pain, but little is known about long-term effects.  the web-based delivery of psychosocial interventions is a promising treatment modality for people suffering from chronic pain, and other forms of physical and mental illness.  internet-based interventions are increasingly used to support self-management of individuals with chronic illnesses.  web-based programs delivered via smartphones are increasingly used to support the self-management of various health disorders, but research on smartphone interventions for persons with chronic pain is limited.  the objective of the present systematic review is to evaluate internet-based interventions for persons with chronic pain.  an online self-management program for people with chronic back pain can lead to improvements in stress, coping, and social support, and produce clinically significant differences in pain, depression, anxiety, and global rates of improvement.  the review identified 27 contemporary pain management websites that could be used for self-management skills training.  internet-based interventions for chronic pain have demonstrated efficacy and may address access barriers to care.  this study offers insights into health care providers' considerations for the potential of digital self-management interventions supporting patients living with chronic pain.  research on web-based interventions to support self-management following participation in pain management programs is limited.  our findings provide initial evidence that tailored web-based advice could help patients self-manage minor symptoms to a greater extent.  this study aimed to establish the clinical effectiveness of a web-based pain management programme (pmp), specifically whether it would lead to improved clinical outcomes and reduced health care costs in a real-world clinical setting.  to determine whether an interactive self-management website for people with chronic back pain would significantly improve emotional management, coping, self-efficacy to manage pain, pain levels, and physical functioning compared with standard text-based materials.  mobile and web technologies are becoming increasingly used to support the treatment of chronic pain conditions.  therefore, the aim of the current study was to investigate health care providers' experiences of treating patients with chronic pain, their attitudes towards, and use of, digital solutions in pain management, and their suggestions for content and design elements for a potential digital pain self-management intervention.  to evaluate if the contents of pain management websites include the current best practice self-management support strategies for people with persistent pain, are cultural tailored and to determine the website quality.  in this study, we primarily explored for which chronic pain patients web-based acceptance and commitment therapy (act) was (in)effective during a large three-armed randomized controlled trial.  clinicians could refer people with persistent pain to top ranked websites - liveplanbe, aci pain management network, and myjointpain for enabling self-management skills, with the caveats that most websites lacked cultural tailoring, and have limited or no evidence of clinical efficacy. ||| ",yes
Are thyroid hormone receptor alpha1 mutations  implicated in thyroid hormone resistance syndrome?,"background: in humans, resistance to thyroid hormone (rth) caused by mutations in the thyroid hormone receptor alpha (thra) gene, rthα, manifests as tissue-specific hypothyroidism and circulating thyroid hormone levels exhibit hypothyroid-like clinical features.  heterozygous mutations in the thyroid hormone receptor alpha (thra) gene cause resistance to thyroid hormone alpha (rthα), a disease characterized by variable manifestations reminiscent of untreated congenital hypothyroidism but a raised triiodothyronine/thyroxine ratio and normal thyrotropin levels.  resistance to thyroid hormone alpha (rthα) is a rare and under-recognized genetic disease caused by mutations of thra, the gene encoding thyroid hormone receptor α1 (trα1).  resistance to thyroid hormone due to thra mutations (rthα) is a recently discovered genetic disease, displaying important variability in its clinical presentation.  mutations of the thyroid hormone receptor beta (trbeta) gene cause resistance to thyroid hormone (rth).  resistance to thyroid hormone syndrome (rth) is an autosomal dominant or recessive genetic disease caused by mutation of either the thyroid hormone receptorβ (thr-β) gene or the thyroid hormone receptorα (thr-α) gene.  mutations in the thyroid hormone receptor beta (tr beta) gene result in tr beta 1 mutants that mediate the clinical phenotype by interfering with transcription of thyroid hormone-regulated genes via a dominant negative effect.  resistance to thyroid hormone alpha (rthα), a disorder characterized by tissue-selective hypothyroidism and near-normal thyroid function tests due to thyroid receptor alpha gene mutations, is rare but probably under-recognized.  about 85% of patients with rth harbor mutations in thyroid hormone receptor  (tr).  activating somatic mutations in the thyrotropin (tsh) receptor have been identified as a cause of hyperfunctioning thyroid adenomas, and germline mutations have been found in familial nonautoimmune hyperthyroidism and sporadic congenital hyperthyroidism.  resistance to thyroid hormone beta (rthβ) is an inherited syndrome caused by mutations in the thyroid hormone receptor β (thrb) gene.  rthα is a recently discovered resistance to thyroid hormone (rth) due to mutation of thra, the gene encoding trα1, the thyroid hormone receptor.  constitutively activating mutations of the thyrotropin (tsh) receptor have been identified as a molecular cause of toxic adenomas, nonautoimmune familial hyperthyroidism, and sporadic congenital hyperthyroidism.  resistance to thyroid hormone (rth) is a rare autosomal hereditary disorder characterized by increased serum thyroid hormone (th) levels with unsuppressed or increased thyrotropin concentration.  patients with mutations in thrb present with resistance to thyroid hormone β (rthβ), which is a disorder characterized by elevated levels of thyroid hormone, normal or elevated levels of tsh and goitre.  thyroid hormone resistance (rth) is a rare autosomal dominant disorder, characterized clinically by goiter and biochemically by elevated circulating free thyroid hormone levels in the presence of measurable serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (tsh) concentrations.  these patients had a clinical syndrome of resistance to th associated with high serum th and nonsuppressed thyroid-stimulating hormone levels.  autosomal dominant non-autoimmune hyperthyroidism is caused by activating tshr germline mutations.  resistance to thyroid hormone (rth) is a clinical syndrome characterized by elevated serum thyroid hormone (th) levels, unsuppressed thyrotropin (tsh) levels, and tissue hyposensitivity to th.  resistance to thyroid hormone (rth) is a syndrome characterized by refractoriness of the pituitary and/or peripheral tissues to the action of thyroid hormone. ||| ",yes

Are transcribed ultraconserved regions involved in cancer?,"ultraconserved regions (ucrs) have been shown to originate non-coding rna transcripts (t-ucrs) that have different expression profiles and play functional roles in the pathophysiology of multiple cancers.  expression of transcribed ultraconserved regions (t-ucrs) is often deregulated in cancer.  the transcribed ultraconserved regions (t-ucrs) encode long non-coding rnas implicated in human carcinogenesis.  the transcribed ultraconserved regions (t-ucrs) are a novel class of long non-coding rnas and are involved in the development of several types of cancer.  the transcribed ultraconserved regions (t-ucrs) are a novel class of non-coding rnas that are absolutely conserved across species and are involved in carcinogenesis in some cancers.  we report that a large fraction of genomic ultraconserved regions (ucrs) encode a particular set of ncrnas whose expression is altered in human cancers.  non-coding rna transcripts originating from ultraconserved regions (ucrs) have tissue-specific expression and play relevant roles in the pathophysiology of multiple cancer types.  transcribed ultraconserved regions (t-ucrs) are a subgroup of lncrnas conserved in several species, and are often located in cancer-related regions.  aberrant expression of long non-coding rnas (lncrnas) has been detected in several types of cancer, including acute lymphoblastic leukemia (all), but lncrna mapped on transcribed ultraconserved regions (t-ucrs) are little explored.  transcribed-ultraconserved regions (t-ucrs) are long non-coding rnas (lncrna) encoded by a subset of long ultraconserved stretches in the human genome.  one class of long noncoding rnas called transcribed ultraconserved regions (t-ucrs) is highly conserved in many species and closely related to diverse physiological and pathological processes.  ucrs are frequently located at fragile sites and genomic regions involved in cancers.  : deregulation of the transcribed ultra-conserved regions (t-ucrs) uc160, uc283, and uc346 has been reported in colorectal cancer (crc) recently.  conservation of gene sequences across species may indicate an essential functional role, and therefore we evaluated the expression of ultraconserved rnas (ucrna) in hepatocellular cancer (hcc).  transcribed ultraconserved regions (t-ucrs) are a class of non-coding rnas with 100% sequence conservation among human, rat and mouse genomes.  ultraconserved regions are noncoding genomic segments that are 100% conserved across humans, mice, and rats.  transcribed ultraconserved regions (t-ucrs) are noncoding rnas derived from dna sequences that are entirely conserved across species.  we selected 565 regions of lncrnas and t-ucrs that are expressed in breast or breast cancer tissue, or show expression correlation to major breast cancer associated genes.  long noncoding rnas have recently emerged as significant contributors to cancers, including breast cancer (bc).  among these ucrnas, the greatest change was noted for ultraconserved element 338 (uc.338), which was dramatically increased in human hcc compared with noncancerous adjacent tissues. ||| ",yes
Are transcription and splicing connected?,"the two processes appear to be functionally connected because a number of variables that regulate transcription have been identified as also influencing splicing.  this review highlights the observations that implicate splicing as occurring during transcription and describes the evidence supporting functional interactions between the two processes.  splicing is a co-transcriptional process, and different experimental approaches show that splicing is coupled to transcription in drosophila, yeast and mammals.  transcription and splicing are intrinsically linked, as splicing needs a pre-mrna substrate to commence.  however, transcription and splicing are tightly linked and increasing evidence shows that nascent transcripts can undergo splicing in the vicinity of chromatin while still attached to the rna polymerase ii (rnapii) transcriptional machinery.  the functional coupling of transcription and splicing has been reported both in vivo and in vitro, but the molecular mechanisms governing these interactions remain largely unknown.  does splicing start while rna polymerase ii is still transcribing?  there is increasing evidence from yeast to humans that pre-mrna splicing occurs mainly cotranscriptionally, such that splicing and transcription are functionally coupled.  i discuss postulated models of how splicing couples to transcription and consider the potential impact that such coupling might have on exon recognition.  here, we show that splicing factors function directly to promote transcriptional elongation, demonstrating that transcription is more intimately coupled to splicing than previously thought.  many splicing events occur co-transcriptionally when the pre-mrna is still associated with the transcription machinery.  transcription and pre-mrna splicing are tightly coupled gene expression events in eukaryotic cells.  transcription is well known to influence splicing, but how splicing may affect transcription remains unclear.  both depend primarily on the same signals and components as cis-splicing.  the presence of transcription factors in the spliceosome and the existence of proteins, such as the coactivator pgc-1, with dual activities in splicing and transcription can explain the links between both processes and add a new level of complexity to the regulation of gene expression in eukaryotes.  we discuss here the different mechanisms by which transcription regulates alternative splicing.  altogether, these findings provide evidence that coupling between transcription and alternative splicing is an important layer of gene expression regulation in plants.  in metazoan organisms, pre-mrna splicing is thought to occur during transcription, and it is postulated that these two processes are functionally coupled via still-unknown mechanisms.  in the last several years, a number of studies have shown that spliceosome assembly and splicing catalysis can occur co-transcriptionally.  transcription and pre-mrna splicing are extremely complex multimolecular processes that involve protein-dna, protein-rna, and protein-protein interactions. ||| ",yes
Are ultraconserved elements depleted among copy number variants (CNVs)?,"we have demonstrated that nonexonic uces are depleted among segmental duplications (sds) and copy number variants (cnvs) and proposed that their ultraconservation may reflect a mechanism of copy counting via comparison.  ultraconserved elements (uces) are strongly depleted from segmental duplications and copy number variations (cnvs) in the human genome, suggesting that deletion or duplication of a uce can be deleterious to the mammalian cell.  ultraconserved elements (uces) are sequences that are identical between reference genomes of distantly related species.  among those, copy number variants (cnvs), including duplicated genomic regions and transposable elements (tes), may contribute to local adaptation and/or reproductive isolation among divergent populations.  copy number variation (cnv), an important source of diversity in genomic structure, is frequently found in clusters called cnv regions (cnvrs).  here we address the process by which cnvs become depleted of uces.  conserved, ultraconserved and other classes of constrained elements (collectively referred as cnes here), identified by comparative genomics in a wide variety of genomes, are non-randomly distributed across chromosomes.  we begin by showing that depletion for uces characterizes the most recent large-scale human cnv datasets and then find that even newly formed de novo cnvs, which have passed through meiosis at most once, are significantly depleted for uces.  the cnv-type core elements contained significantly larger proportions of long terminal repeat (ltr) types of retrotransposon than the constant-type core elements, which had no cnv.  this observation raises the possibility that cnvs that arise somatically and are relatively newly formed are less likely to have established a cnv profile that is depleted for uces.  here, we report that nonexonic uces are also depleted among 10 of 11 recent genomewide data sets of human cnvs, including 3 obtained with strategies permitting greater precision in determining the extents of cnvs.  the higher divergence rates observed in the cnv-type core elements than in the constant type indicate that the cnv-type core elements have a longer evolutionary history than constant-type core elements in sd13m.  although conserved noncoding elements (cnes) constitute the majority of sequences under purifying selection in the human genome, they remain poorly understood.  ultraconserved elements in the human genome likely harbor important biological functions as they are dosage sensitive and are able to direct tissue-specific expression.  for common variants (frequency >10%), we observed a distinct bias against copy-number losses, suggesting that deletions are subject to purifying selection.  cnvrs are strongly associated with segmental duplications (sds), but the composition of these complex repetitive structures remains unclear.  conserved noncoding elements (cnes) constitute the majority of sequences under purifying selection in the human genome, yet their function remains largely unknown.  comparative genome hybridization array analysis showed that whereas 42 core elements were components of cnvr that varied among mouse strains, 8 did not vary among strains (constant type), and the status of the others could not be determined.  our results suggest genetic variation in (ultra-)conserved non-genic sequence elements which might alter functional properties.  in support of this latter explanation, somatic cnvs that are not associated with disease are depleted for uces. ||| ",yes
Are ultraconserved elements often transcribed?,"ultraconserved elements are nucleotide or protein sequences with 100% identity (no mismatches, insertions, or deletions) in the same organism or between two or more organisms.  ultraconserved elements (uces) are sequences that are identical between reference genomes of distantly related species.  we identified large numbers of ultraconserved elements across distant species.  ultraconserved elements are highly enriched with binding sites to developmental transcription factors regardless of how they cluster.  interestingly, we observed that ultraconserved elements clustered by sequence similarity.  our findings indicate that these ultraconserved elements are not the exclusive property of higher modern eukaryotes, but rather transmitted from their metazoan ancestors.  ultraconserved elements (uces) are stretches of hundreds of nucleotides with highly conserved cores flanked by variable regions.  ultraconserved elements (uces) are stretches of hundreds of nucleotides with highly conserved cores flanked by variable regions.  ultraconserved elements of dna have been identified in vertebrate and invertebrate genomes.  the ultraconserved elements (uces) are defined as stretches of at least 200 base pairs of human dna that match identically with corresponding regions in the mouse and rat genomes, albeit their real significance remains an intriguing issue.  ultraconservation has been variously defined to describe sequences that have remained identical or nearly so over long periods of evolution to a degree that is higher than expected for sequences under typical constraints associated with protein-coding sequences, splice sites, or transcription factor binding sites.  ultraconserved elements (uces) show the peculiar feature to retain extended perfect sequence identity among human, mouse, and rat genomes.  most intergenic ultraconserved elements (uce) appear to be tissue-specific enhancers, whereas another class of intragenic uces is involved in regulation of gene expression by means of alternative splicing.  transcribed ultraconserved regions (t-ucrs) are a novel class of long noncoding rnas transcribed from ucrs, which exhibit 100% dna sequence conservation among humans, mice, and rats.  ultraconserved regions (ucrs) are non-protein coding gene sequences that are strictly conserved across among different species.  transcribed ultraconserved regions (t-ucrs) are noncoding rnas derived from dna sequences that are entirely conserved across species.  transcribed ultraconserved regions (t-ucrs) are genomic regions conserved across large evolutionary distances, which encode for noncoding rnas that serve as regulators of gene expression.  transcribed ultraconserved regions are a novel class of long noncoding rnas and are completely conserved in humans, rats, and mice.  transcribed ultraconserved regions are a novel class of long noncoding rnas and are completely conserved in humans, rats, and mice.  transcribed ultraconserved regions have been implicated in diverse biological processes; however, very little is currently known about their role in pain modulation. ||| ",yes
Are viruses involved in the etiology of human subacute thyroiditis?,"viral infections are frequently cited as a major environmental factor involved in subacute thyroiditis and autoimmune thyroid diseases this review examines the data related to the role of viruses in the development of thyroiditis.  subacute thyroiditis is generally believed to be of viral origin, and infection is also suspected of playing a role as a triggering factor in the pathogenesis of autoimmune thyroid diseases.  most cases of subacute thyroiditis are caused by a variety of viruses, for example, coxsackie, cytomegalovirus, epstein-barr virus, and adenovirus.  from indirect and circumstantial evidence it would appear that subacute thyroiditis is probably a viral infection of the thyroid gland.  subacute thyroiditis is generally believed to be induced by viral infection, and little attention has been paid to anti-thyroid antibodies.  influenza immunization or infection may cause subacute thyroiditis.  the presence of viruses in the thyroid has been shown, but whether they are implicated in thyroid diseases or are only spectators is under investigation.  subacute thyroiditis is an inflammatory disease of the thyroid gland, most probably preceded by viral infection.  although viral infection is thought to be associated with subacute thyroiditis and probably with autoimmune thyroid disease, possible changes in thyroid function during the prodromal period of infection or subclinical infection remain largely unknown.  new data on viruses isolated from patients with subacute thyroiditis de quervain are reported.  although viral infection has been suspected as the cause of some thyroid disorders, there has been limited data to support this contention seriously.  these observations in an experimental model support the hypothesis that viruses may account for some thyroid disorders in man.  subacute (de quervain's) thyroiditis is a rare but important cause of fever of unknown origin.  subacute granulomatous thyroiditis is an inflammatory thyroid condition that is presumed to be caused by a viral infection or postviral inflammatory process.  the role of viruses in the pathogenesis of autoimmune thyroid diseases is controversial.  the aim of this study was to examine whether subacute thyroiditis triggers tsh receptor antibody-associated thyroid disorders.  this review summarizes our knowledge respecting the role of viral infection in the cause of hashimoto's thyroiditis.  the role of viruses as environmental triggers for hashimoto's thyroiditis (ht) is controversial.  on the other hand, subacute thyroiditis is a self-limited inflammatory disease of presumed viral aetiology.  subacute thyroiditis may trigger autoreactive b cells to produce tsh receptor antibodies, resulting in tsh receptor antibody-associated thyroid dysfunction in some patients. ||| ",yes
Can Alzheimer's disease related miRNAs be detected in patients' blood?,"peripheral blood micrornas (mirna) have been identified as potential biomarkers for alzheimer's disease (ad).  microrna (mirna) may be potential biomarkers of alzheimer's disease (ad).  recent evidence suggests changes in circulating microrna levels may be promising biomarkers for the clinical diagnosis of alzheimer disease (ad).  the purpose of our study was to identify micrornas (mirnas) as early detectable peripheral biomarkers in alzheimer's disease (ad).  mirnas constitute the promising next generation of alzheimer's disease (ad) biomarkers and have the potential to diagnose neurodegenerative diseases.  micrornas (mirs) are attractive molecules to be considered as one of the blood-based biomarkers for neurodegenerative disorders such as alzheimer's disease (ad).  micrornas (mirnas) are attractive molecules to utilize as one of the blood-based biomarkers for neurodegenerative disorders such as alzheimer's disease (ad) because mirnas are relatively stable in biofluid, including serum or plasma.  aim: it is already known that mirnas can be differentially expressed in alzheimer's disease (ad).  the aim of this study is to establish candidate blood mirna biomarkers for ad by comparing differences in mirna expression between participants with brain amyloid imaging-defined ad and normal cognition.  the aim of the study was to profile circulating mirnas in serum as non-invasive biomarkers for ad, correlating them with those identified in csf, the biological fluid which better reflects biochemical changes occurring during pathological processes in the brain and may provide a robust indicator of ad-related disease pathogenesis thanks to the evidence of low amyloid and high levels of tau and hyperphosphorylated tau.  in this study, the potential role of these mirnas as diagnostic markers for ad was investigated.  as micrornas are released from neurons and enter the bloodstream, circulating micrornas may be reflective of ad progression and are ideal candidates as biomarkers for early-stage disease detection.  although the ability of these mirnas to conclusively diagnose for ad is currently unknown, our findings suggest a potential use for circulating mirnas, along with other markers, as non-invasive and relatively inexpensive biomarkers for the early diagnosis of ad, however, with further research and validation.  the data suggest that the differentially expressed serum mirnas could be used as biomarkers to improve the diagnosis of ad, particularly at the early stage, and to classify its clinical stages.  our study found that mirnas have certain diagnostic value for cognitive impairment, with high sensitivity and specificity, especially in diagnostics with multiple mirnas and serum-based mirna assays.  our findings support blood-borne mir-9 as a candidate biomarker for probable ad, embodied by evidence from the literature of its implication in amyloidogenesis.  mirna profiling was performed using small rna sequencing on 71 participants, comprising 40 ad with high brain amyloid burden on imaging (amyloid positive) and 31 cognitively normal controls with low brain amyloid burden (amyloid negative).  conclusion: this meta-analysis showed that mirnas may be a promising biomarkers for ad.  the expression levels of exosomal mir-135a, -193b, and -384 in the serum from mild cognitive impairment (mci), dementia of alzheimer-type (dat), parkinson's disease with dementia (pdd), and vascular dementia (vad) patients were measured with a real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase pcr (qrt-pcr) method.  to achieve our objective, we assessed mirnas in serum samples from ad patients and mild cognitive impairment (mci) subjects relative to healthy controls. ||| ",yes
Can CD55 deficiency cause thrombosis?,"loss of cd55 expression in those patients compromises the complement regulatory function, thereby accelerating rbc lysis.  this could suggest a mechanism (could be genetic) responsible for low cd55 expression.  moreover, cd55 deficiency on red cells influences hemoglobin concentration.  this study provides evidence supporting the presence of erythrocytes with cd55 and/or cd59 deficiency in patients with rheumatic diseases.  interestingly, the majority of patients (104/113, 92%) demonstrated cd55- and/or cd59-deficient erythrocytes: 47 (41.6%) with concomitant deficiency of cd55 and cd59, 50 (44.2%) with isolated deficiency of cd55, and 6 (6.2%) with isolated deficiency of cd59.  complement hyperactivation, angiopathic thrombosis and protein-losing enteropathy (chaple disease) is a lethal disease caused by genetic loss of the complement regulatory protein cd55, leading to overactivation of complement and innate immunity together with immunodeficiency due to immunoglobulin wasting in the intestine.  cd55 is a complement regulatory protein expressed by cells to protect them from bystander lysis by complement.  however, cd55 expression significantly influenced hemoglobin values (f=6.092, p=0.015).  in this study, we aimed to evaluate the expression of cd55 on erythrocytes of β-thal patients.  in contrast to observations in many inflammatory disease models, lack of cd55 resulted in decreased arthritis in experimental models of ra.  complement has the potential to provoke severe impairment to host tissues, as shown in autoimmune diseases where complement activation has been associated with diminished cd55 and/or cd59 expression on peripheral blood cell membranes.  since deficiencies of other protein c system proteins are known to cause thrombotic disease, then defects in the gene coding for tm could be responsible for inherited thrombophilia.  in the cases reported so far, congenital isolated cd59 deficiency was associated with recurrent episodes of hemolytic anemia, peripheral neuropathy, and strokes.  cd55, cd59, cd35 and cd46 are cell membrane proteins that have regulatory properties on the activation of the complement cascade.  these results suggest there is an altered pattern of cd55 and cd59 expression on the peripheral blood cells of sle patients, and it may play a role in the cytopenias in these patients.  this study was undertaken to investigate the role of cd55 in experimental ra.  however, cd55 is also expressed in normal tissues, body fluids and stroma, limiting the use of anti-cd55 therapeutic antibodies.  flow cytometry analysis of cd55 was conducted on rbcs of 21 β-thalassemia major (β-tm) patients, 11 β-thalassemia intermedia (β-ti) patients and 10 healthy volunteers.  here, we demonstrate that cd55-deficient mice display a comparable phenotype with about two-fold more circulating granulocytes in the blood stream, the marginated pool, and the spleen.  the results showed a significant decrease in cd55 expression in β-tm (57.5 ± 16.7%), while there was a slight decrease in β-ti patients (81.8 ± 3.8%) in comparison with that of the normal controls (88.7 ± 0.8%). ||| ",yes
Can DNA intercalators function as topoisomerase inhibitors?,"dna topoisomerase ii (top2) is the target of some of the most effective anticancer dna intercalators.  it seems likely that if these intercalating topoisomerase ii poisons are structurally modified to also be dna alkylating agents, they will have increased dwell time on the topoisomerase ii-dna complex and increased potency and selectivity for cancer cells.  the cytotoxic actions of several classes of antitumor dna intercalators are thought to result from some disturbance to dna metabolism following trapping of the nuclear enzyme dna topoisomerase ii as a covalent complex on dna.  some topoisomerase inhibitors trap covalent topoisomerase-dna complexes as topoisomerase-drug-dna ternary complexes.  dna topoisomerase i (top1) and topoisomerase ii (top2) inhibitors are widely used to treat a variety of cancers.  topoisomerases i and ii, intranuclear enzymes that play vital roles in dna replication and transcription, are attractive targets for cancer chemotherapy.  these hybrid compounds showed enhanced dna alkylating activity in the presence of topoisomerase ii, exhibited significant activity against all the cancer cells tested at submicromolar concentrations, and were more potent than both parent compounds.  the mechanism of their action is based on the inhibition of dna topoisomerase ii activity.  dna topoisomerase (topo) ii inhibitors either stabilize dna-topo ii complexes by blocking dna religation (e.g.  the indenoisoquinolines represent a class of non-camptothecin topoisomerase i (top1) inhibitors that exert cytotoxicity by trapping the covalent complex formed between dna and top1 during relaxation of dna supercoils.  these data suggest that inhibition of topoisomerase ii may provide a potentially effective clinical strategy for sensitizing human brain tumors, and possibly other tumors as well, to dna cross-linking anticancer agents.  we suggest that the results provide evidence that dna intercalators may differ in the forms of complexes induced and that the comparatively high cytotoxicity of mitoxantrone relates to the ability of the drug to trap topoisomerase ii complexes in a form which effects a long-term inhibition of dna replication and g2 traverse.  by altering the accessibility of dna sequences for alkylation or platination, and/or for subsequent repair, topoisomerase ii can potentially affect the level of dna interstrand cross-links induced in cells by bifunctional agents.  dna intercalating drugs and the epipodophyllotoxins etoposide and teniposide interfere with the action of mammalian dna topoisomerase ii by trapping an intermediate complex of the enzyme covalently linked to the 5'-termini of dna breaks.  specific inhibitors of eukaryotic dna topoisomerases i and ii (camptothecin and vm-26, respectively) were used to examine the involvement of topoisomerases in dna replication and chromatin assembly in vivo.  topoisomerase ii, an enzyme that catalyzes changes in the topology of dna, plays several key roles in dna metabolism and chromosome structure, and it is the primary cytotoxic target for a number of clinically important dna intercalating agents such as doxorubicin.  bacterial type iia topoisomerase inhibitors, such as fluoroquinolones and novel bacterial topoisomerase inhibitors, can trap dna cleavage complexes with double- or single-stranded cleaved dna.  the action of several anticancer drugs, eg, dna intercalating agents (ie, anthracyclines, anthracenediones, anthrapyrazoles, amsacrines, and ellipticines) and epipodophyllotoxins, appears to be mediated by the enzyme topoisomerase ii alpha.  synergistic activity of the combination of topoisomerase i and topoisomerase ii inhibitors or of topoisomerase inhibitors and radiotherapy has been found to be highly dependent on the sequence used.  dna topoisomerases are enzymes that are able to link and unlink dna strands. ||| ",yes
Can Diabetes be caused by a defect in a potassium chanel?,"the diminished insulin secretion of type 2 diabetes might result from abnormal regulation of the potassium permeability which leads to beta-cell depolarization.  we examined a possible association between serum potassium and prediabetes (defined as isolated impaired fasting glucose , isolated impaired glucose tolerance  or combined ifg/igt), as well as known and newly diagnosed diabetes (ndd), in 32- to 81-year-old men and women with and without hypertension.  in the diabetic patient, hyperkalemia and hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis has been attributed to one or more of the following factors associated with diabetic nephropathy: hypoaldosteronism, altered potassium homeostasis, or a distal tubular (dt) defect in hydrogen ion secretion.  background: low potassium has been identified both as a risk factor for type 2 diabetes and as a mediator of the racial disparity in diabetes risk.  this study aimed to investigate whether low serum potassium is associated with increased risk of type 2 diabetes in apparently healthy japanese men.  hypokalemia (low serum potassium level) is a common electrolyte imbalance that can cause a defect in urinary concentrating ability, i.e., nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (ndi), but the molecular mechanism is unknown.  evidence suggests that low serum potassium concentrations or hypokalaemia induced by the intake of diuretics are associated with incident diabetes and increased risk for diabetes in persons with hypertension.  evidence has suggested that low serum potassium concentrations decrease insulin secretion, leading to glucose intolerance, and that hypokalaemia induced by diuretics increases the risk for diabetes in hypertensive individuals.  mild to moderately low serum potassium levels, within the normal range and without frank hypokalaemia, could be predictive of type 2 diabetes in apparently healthy japanese men.  patients with diabetes mellitus (dm) frequently develop electrolyte disorders, including hyperkalemia.  every 0.5 mmol/l lower increment in the baseline serum potassium level was associated with a 45% (12-87%) increased risk of diabetes.  thiazide-induced potassium loss may contribute to new onset diabetes (nod).  this effect is explained by the role of the kcnq1 protein as a potassium channel that in the pancreatic beta-cells drives an electrical signal that facilitates glucose-stimulated insulin secretion.  the lowest tertile of serum potassium (2.8-3.9 mmol/l) was independently associated with the development of diabetes after adjustment for known predictors (hr 1.57 ) compared with the highest tertile (4.2-5.4 mmol/l).  chronic potassium (k+) deficiency has been shown previously to cause a reduction in solute content in the renal papilla, an effect that is potentially important as a contributing factor to the concentrating defect seen in this circumstance.  there were no significant differences in glucose or insulin measures during the ogtt between the 2 groups, but there was a trend for improved insulin sensitivity in potassium-treated participants.conclusions: in this pilot trial, kcl at a dose of 40 meq/d did not increase serum potassium significantly.  the possibility of a generalized defect has been investigated in vitro by the stimulation of 86rb efflux from red cells of type 2 diabetic patients by calcium ionophore and its inhibition by quinine.  serum potassium levels were independently associated with prediabetes and ndd in hypertensive adults from the general population.  these results indicate that the endogenous ketoacidemia and hyperglycemia observed in dka, which result primarily from insulin deficit, are the main determinants of increased p. since exogenous ketoacidemia and hyperglycemia in the otherwise normal experimental animal do not increase p, it is postulated that insulin deficit itself may be the major initiating cause of the hyperkalemia that develops in dka.  cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate hrs for incident diabetes (fasting plasma glucose level ≥ 7.0 mmol/l, hba(1c) ≥ 6.5% or self-reported) including serum potassium concentration as either a categorical or a continuous variable. ||| ",yes
Can FOXOs modulate longevity?,"this article describes briefly the existing knowledge that is related to the role of foxo factors in human longevity.  our study provides novel insights into the basis for the long-established role of foxo3 as a longevity gene.  the forkhead box o (foxo) transcription factors are famous for their role in longevity: both caenorhabditis elegans and drosophila melanogaster can extend their median and maximum lifespan in a foxo-dependent manner, and certain single nucleotide polymorphisms in human foxo genes are associated with reaching an age above 100 years.  foxo3 is a prominent longevity gene.  we highlight some of the key findings that are associated with foxo3 protein, its gene and homologs in relation to lifespan in different species, and the insights these findings might provide about the molecular, cellular, and physiological processes that modulate aging and longevity in humans.  understanding the regulatory inputs on foxo may reveal how changes in these regulatory signaling pathways affect disease and lifespan.  here, we discuss possible connections between foxo and the dna damage response in the context of the broader role of connecting lifespan and disease.  several human studies provide evidence for an association between aging, longevity and variation in foxo3.  for instance, foxo (forkhead box o) genes determine human longevity.  we suggest that the foxo3 longevity genotype increases lifespan only in at-risk individuals by protection against cardiometabolic stress.  in model organisms, foxo activity also affects stem cell maintenance and lifespan as well as age-related diseases, such as cancer and diabetes.  the foxo family of transcription factors is central to the regulation of organismal longevity and cellular survival.  foxo transcription factors (foxos) are central regulators of lifespan across species, yet they also have cell-specific functions, including adult stem cell homeostasis and immune function.  follow-up until dec 31, 2019 found that in cmd-affected individuals, longevity-associated alleles of foxo3 were associated with significantly longer lifespan: haplotype hazard ratio 0.81 (95% ci 0.72-0.91; diabetes 0.77, hypertension 0.82, chd 0.83).  foxo3 is one of the most prominent genes demonstrating a consistently reproducible genetic association with human longevity.  previous studies note specific foxo3 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) associated with human longevity.  foxo transcription factors are involved in the regulation of longevity phenomenon via insulin and insulin-like growth factor signaling.  reduced telomere attrition may be a key mechanism for the longevity-promoting effect of the foxo3 genotype studied.  foxo3 is generally recognized as a ""master"" gene in aging since its association with longevity has been replicated in multiple organisms and human populations.  the diversity of this upstream regulation and the downstream effects of foxos suggest that they function as homeostasis regulators to maintain tissue homeostasis over time and coordinate a response to environmental changes, including growth factor deprivation, metabolic stress (starvation) and oxidative stress. ||| ",yes
Can GDF15 be a biomarker for metformin treatment?,"aim: gdf15 levels are a biomarker for metformin use.  growth differentiation factor 15 (gdf-15), a suggested biomarker for metformin use, may explain the potential cardioprotective and anti-cancer properties of metformin.  in participants with diabetes, metformin treatment was associated with a 40% rise in gdf-15 level, which was independent of the other major factors, and largely explained their elevated gdf-15 levels.  the relatively high gdf-15 bioavailability might partly explain the protective cardiovascular effects of metformin.  to gain insight into the relationship of gdf-15 with metformin and major cardiovascular risk factors, we analysed the data from the summit cohort (n = 1438), a four-centre, nested, case-control study aimed at verifying whether biomarkers of atherosclerosis differ according to the presence of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease.  conclusion: noncoding variation within a metformin-activated enhancer may increase gdf15 expression and help to predict gdf15 levels.  our results contrast the bmi-lowering effects of an acute increase in gdf15 levels observed after metformin use.  results: the gwas lead snp rs888663, the snp rs62122429 associated with gdf15 levels in the outcome reduction with initial glargine intervention trial, and the gtex-expression quantitative trait locus rs4808791 for gdf15 expression in whole blood are located in a metformin-activated enhancer upstream of gdf15 and tightly linked in europeans and east asians.  the altered glucose and lipid profiles by metformin treatment may be associated with the increased circulating fgf21 and tissue-specific expressions of fgfr1.  produced as a tissue defence response to hypoxia and inflammation, growth differentiation factor-15 (gdf-15) is elevated in people receiving metformin treatment.  we performed the functional annotation of noncoding genome-wide association study (gwas) snps for gdf15 levels and the genotype-tissue expression (gtex)-expression quantitative trait loci (eqtls) for gdf15 expression within metformin-activated enhancers around gdf15.  to understand metformin's effects on fibroblast growth factors (fgfs) and fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (fgfr1), we investigated circulating fibroblast growth factor-19 (fgf19), fgf21 levels, and fgfr1 in type 2 diabetes mellitus (t2dm).  metformin, the popular anti-diabetic drug was shown to exert multiple biological effects.  understanding the genetic contribution to metformin response might increase the possibility of personalising metformin treatment.  metformin, the gold standard in type 2 diabetes treatment, is a drug with multi-faceted effects.  these findings have direct implications for informing pharmacological strategies aimed at targeting gdf15 levels for weight loss.  growth-differentiation factor 15 (gdf15) is an inflammatory cytokine involved in energy homeostasis that is being pursued as a drug target for obesity.  secondary analyses included examination of the association of gdf-15 with type 2 diabetes, glycaemic traits, bp, lipids and bmi.  metformin is a first-line oral agent used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but glycaemic response to this drug is highly variable.  metformin, as the first-line treatment anti-diabetic drug, represents increasing evidence of a potential efficacy in improving dyslipidemia. ||| ",yes
Can Levoxyl (levothyroxine sodium) cause insomnia?,"we discuss the use of levothyroxine for excessive daytime sleepiness (eds) and prolonged nocturnal sleep time in a euthyroid patient with narcolepsy.  levothyroxine improved eds and total sleep time in a euthyroid patient with narcolepsy without cataplexy after 12 weeks without side effects.  after failure of first-line narcolepsy treatments, a 48-year-old female began levothyroxine (25 mcg/day).  clinicians should consider prescribing levothyroxine intake at bedtime.  a pilot study showed that levothyroxine intake at bedtime significantly decreased thyrotropin levels and increased free thyroxine and total triiodothyronine levels.  however, many patients have trouble for taking levothyroxine in the morning.  however, many patients have difficulties taking levothyroxine in the morning.  levothyroxine taken at bedtime significantly improved thyroid hormone levels.  levothyroxine absorption can indeed be impaired by age, patient's compliance, fasting, the intake of certain foods (such as dietary fibers, grapes, soybeans, papaya and coffee) or by some drugs (such as proton-pump inhibitors, antacids, sucralfate, et cetera).  levothyroxine is commonly used in the treatment of patients with hypothyroidism.  levothyroxine is commonly used in the treatment of patients with hypothyroidism.  secondary outcomes, including quality-of-life questionnaires (36-item short form health survey, hospital anxiety and depression scale, 20-item multidimensional fatigue inventory, and a symptoms questionnaire), showed no significant changes between morning vs bedtime intake of levothyroxine.  levothyroxine (lt4) is used to treat frequently encountered endocrinopathies such as thyroid diseases.  levothyroxine sodium is widely prescribed to treat primary hypothyroidism.  this article reviews the literature on combination therapy using levothyroxine and liothyronine, and found that only one study produced beneficial outcomes; other studies reported increased adverse reactions among participants.  levothyroxine has a narrow therapeutic index: both underdosage (subclinical hypothyroidism) and excessive dosage (subclinical hyperthyroidism) are associated with adverse symptoms and pathophysiological effects and are to be avoided.  levothyroxine sodium (lt4) is the therapy of choice for hypothyroidism.  to ascertain if levothyroxine intake at bedtime instead of in the morning improves thyroid hormone levels, a randomized double-blind crossover trial was performed between april 1, 2007, and november 30, 2008, among 105 consecutive patients with primary hypothyroidism at maasstad hospital rotterdam in the netherlands.  changing the levothyroxine administration time from before breakfast to before dinner reduced the therapeutic efficacy of levothyroxine.  there is consensus that levothyroxine should be taken in the morning on an empty stomach. ||| ",yes
Can Logic Alignment Free (LAF) be used for bacterial genomes classification?,"we apply laf successfully to the classification of bacterial genomes to their corresponding taxonomy.  in this paper, we present logic alignment free (laf), a method that combines alignment-free techniques and rule-based classification algorithms in order to assign biological samples to their taxa.  we present a clustering-free approach to multi-sample illumina data sets that can identify independent bacterial subpopulations regardless of the similarity of their 16s tag sequences.  alignment-free algorithms can be used to estimate the similarity of biological sequences and hence are often applied to the phylogenetic reconstruction of genomes.  although gene-finding in bacterial genomes is relatively straightforward, the automated assignment of gene function is still challenging, resulting in a vast quantity of hypothetical sequences of unknown function.  sequence analysis of the 16s rrna gene represents a highly accurate and versatile method for bacterial classification and identification, even when the species in question is notoriously difficult to identify by phenotypic means.  here, we present a new web program, micheck (microbial genome checker), that enables rapid verification of sets of annotated genes and frameshifts in previously published bacterial genomes.  fame-based bacterial species classification is successfully evaluated in a taxonomic framework.  we present an automated method for the functional annotation of bacterial protein sequences.  state of the art methods to adjust the frequency of k-mers to the character distribution of the underlying genomes have negligible impact on classification performance, suggesting that the signal of each class is strong and that laf is effective in identifying it.  machine learning techniques have shown to improve bacterial species classification based on fatty acid methyl ester (fame) data.  it is practical for genome-scale data and does not require pre-existing sequence clustering; thus, this method suits the needs of bacterial genome and metagenome researchers.  the annotation process of a newly sequenced bacterial genome is largely based on algorithms derived from databases of previously defined rna and protein-encoding gene structures.  a computer program was developed to identify anaerobic bacteria by using simultaneous pattern recognition via a bayesian probabilistic model.  summarized, by phylogenetic learning we are able to situate and evaluate fame-based bacterial species classification in a more informative context.  this approach has become popular in bacterial genomics because it is one of the few methods that is practical for large datasets and because it does not require additional functional genomics experiments.  automated function prediction has played a central role in determining the biological functions of bacterial proteins.  blannotator is an accurate method for bacterial protein function prediction.  computational approaches that link bacterial 16s rrna gene amplicon data to functional genes based on prokaryotic reference genomes have emerged.  here we report on an r package for genome-wide association studies of orthologous genes in bacteria. ||| ",yes
Can NADPH oxidase be inhibited by apocynin and diphenylene iodonium?,"redox processes are involved in the mechanism of action of nadph oxidase inhibitors such as diphenyleneiodonium and apocynin.  apocynin, or a (myelo)peroxidase-derived product thereof, is a powerful inhibitor of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (nadph) oxidase.  since the effect of apocynin has been correlated with inactivation of the cytosolic fractions of the nadph oxidase complex and its oxidation during the inhibitory process develops a special role in this process, we suggest that the close relationship between the reactivity of the radicals of mc-w compounds with thiol groups and their efficacy as nadph oxidase inhibitor could be the chemical pathway behind the mechanism of action of apocynin and should be taken into account in the design of new and specific nadph oxidase inhibitors.  apocynin has been widely used as an inhibitor of the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase (nadph-oxidase) system and shows promise as an anti-inflammatory drug.  enzymatic oxidation of apocynin, which may mimic in vivo metabolism, affords a large number of oligomers (apocynin oxidation products, aop) that inhibit vascular nadph oxidase.  diphenyleneiodonium (dpi) inhibits activity of flavoenzymes like nadph oxidase, the major source of superoxide anion in cardiovascular system, but affects also other oxidoreductases.  diphenyleneiodonium (dpi) has frequently been used to inhibit reactive oxygen species (ros) production mediated by flavoenzymes, particularly nad(p)h oxidase.  nadph oxidase is believed to be inhibited through prevention of the interaction between two nadph oxidase subunits, p47(phox) and p22(phox).  apocynin diminished these measures of oxidative stress and tnf-α.  loss of the cytochrome c reductase activity could be prevented by adrenodoxin, but not by nadp+.  the aim of this study was to assess whether apocynin, an nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (nadph) oxidase blocker, influences lipid peroxidation tbars, hydrogen peroxide (h2o2) content, protein level, heart edema, tumor necrosis factor α (tnf-α) concentration or the glutathione redox system in heart homogenates obtained from endothelin 1 (et-1)-induced oxidative stress rats.  here, we studied the structure-activity relationship for apocynin and analogous ortho-methoxy-substituted catechols as inhibitors of the nadph oxidase in neutrophils and their reactivity with peroxidase.  nadph and nadp+ stimulated inhibition.  the nadph-cytochrome c reductase activity of nadph-adrenodoxin reductase from nadph to cytochrome c via adrenodoxin was inhibited by pyridoxal 5'-phosphate and other reagents that modified the lysine residues.  thus, our observation that apocynin is a powerful inhibitor of platelet aggregation raises further questions about the selectivity of this drug as an nadph oxidase inhibitor.  our objective is to determine how apocynin, which is a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (nadph) oxidase inhibitor, protects the nonischemic control right lung (rl) from injury by the unilateral ischemic left lung (ll).  kinetic analysis indicated iodonium diphenyl to be an uncompetitive inhibitor of xanthine oxidase, suggesting the need for reduced enzyme for inhibition.  iodonium inhibition of the flavoenzymes neutrophil nadph oxidase and cytochrome p450 reductase has been suggested to require reductive metabolism of the inhibitor to a phenyl radical.  apocynin significantly decreased tbars (p < 0.001) and h2o2 (p < 0.05) level (vs. control) as well as improved protein level (p < 0.001) in the heart.  the administration of a high dose of apocynin inhibited nox2 expression and nox activity, reduced lipid peroxidation, suppressed the nf-κb pathway and subsequent pro-inflammatory cytokines transcription in the lung tissues, and attenuated lung injury during hs and resuscitation in rats. ||| ",yes
Can NEECHAM Confusion Scale be used for evaluation of postoperative delirium?,"use of neecham scaling enabled medical staff to identify cases of possible confusion early, indicating that the neecham confusion scale should be useful for the detection of postoperative delirium and confusion in the surgical ward.  with the aim of determining an objective technique for early detection of delirium, 64 patients admitted to a surgical ward before surgery were examined using the neecham confusion scale.  postoperative delirium was assessed with the confusion assessment method (cam) adapted for the intensive care unit and the conventional cam accompanied by chart review.  this study compares two screening tools  with a dsm-iv-based diagnosis of delirium, conducted by neuropsychiatric examination in postoperative settings.  the trends of the neecham scores in the 3 groups were compared, and the relationship between the neecham scores and suspected clinical risk factors for delirium was investigated.  delirium status of surgical patients was evaluated postoperatively at the time of admission to the intensive care unit (icu) using the confusion assessment method (cam-icu) scale.  postoperative delirium was detected via confusion assessment method or chart review on postoperative days 1 to 5.  the confusion assessment method and memorial delirium assessment scale were administrated before surgery, and on the first, second and fourth days after surgery, to assess the incidence and severity of the delirium, respectively.  the aim of this study was to find a valid and easy-to-use tool to screen for postoperative delirium on the surgical ward.  the early detection and prevention of postoperative delirium and confusion has become an important issue in surgical ward management.  delirium was assessed by the confusion-assessment-method for the intensive care unit (cam-icu) on the first three days after surgery.  this study adds to the body of knowledge that neecham discriminates for delirium.  following surgery, delirium was assessed throughout icu stay using the confusion assessment method for icu delirium and the richmond agitation and sedation scale.  postoperative delirium is an important problem in patients undergoing major surgery.  the aim of the present study was to assess the validity and predictive value of the neecham confusion scale.  a systematic screening tool identifies postoperative delirium with improved prediction of poor 1-year functional survival following cardiac surgery.  we hypothesized that the nsqip risk calculation for serious complications (nsqip-sc) or risk of death (nsqip-d), and cognitive tests of executive function (trail making tests a and b ), would be predictive of postoperative delirium severity.  postoperative delirium is associated with adverse outcome.  delirium screening was performed daily until the sixth postoperative day using the confusion assessment method (cam), the nursing delirium screening scale (nu-desc), and the delirium detection score (dds), and the dsm-iv criteria as the gold standard.  postoperative delirium in the elderly is common and associated with poor outcomes, but often goes unrecognized. ||| ",yes
Can NXY-059 be used for treatment of acute ischemic stroke patients?,"nxy-059 is ineffective for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke within 6 hours after the onset of symptoms.  nxy-059 was well tolerated in patients with an acute stroke at and above concentrations shown to be neuroprotective in an animal model when initiated 4 hours after onset of permanent focal ischemia.  nxy-059 within 6 hours of acute ischemic stroke significantly reduced disability.  the administration of nxy-059 within six hours after the onset of acute ischemic stroke significantly improved the primary outcome (reduced disability at 90 days), but it did not significantly improve other outcome measures, including neurologic functioning as measured by the nihss score.  in patients with acute stroke, nxy-059 is well tolerated at concentrations known to be associated with neuroprotection in animal models of transient cerebral ischemia; however, higher target concentrations appear necessary on the basis of animal models of permanent ischemia.  additional research is needed to confirm whether nxy-059 is beneficial in ischemic stroke.  nxy-059 was well tolerated in patients with an acute stroke.  any effect of nxy-059 on hemostasis may be important when treating stroke patients.  we enrolled 3306 patients with acute ischemic stroke in a randomized, double-blind trial to receive a 72-hour infusion of intravenous nxy-059 or placebo within 6 hours after the onset of stroke symptoms.  nxy-059 is a free radical-trapping neuroprotectant developed for use in acute ischemic stroke.  we conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial involving 1722 patients with acute ischemic stroke who were randomly assigned to receive a 72-hour infusion of placebo or intravenous nxy-059 within 6 hours after the onset of the stroke.  the chosen dosing strategy of nxy-059 provides an easily adapted treatment regimen for acute stroke, resulting in early achievement of target plasma concentrations.  acute ischemic stroke patients receiving nxy-059 may also be exposed to diuretics for treatment of heart failure or hypertension.  we randomized 1722 patients with acute ischemic stroke to a 72-hour infusion of placebo or intravenous nxy-059 within 6 hours of stroke onset.  nxy-059 is a nitrone-based, free-radical trapping agent being developed for the treatment of acute ischaemic stroke.  this was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, dose-escalation, multicenter study that evaluated safety, tolerability, and plasma concentrations of 2 nxy-059 dosing regimens within 24 hours of acute stroke.  nxy-059 (disufenton sodium, cerovive, a nitrone with neuroprotective and free radical trapping properties (in experimental stroke) is under development for the treatment of acute stroke.  nxy-059 has neuroprotective efficacy when given 5 hours after onset of transient focal ischemia in the rat.  nxy-059 is a free radical-trapping neuroprotectant demonstrated to reduce disability from ischemic stroke.  the saint i trial demonstrated that the neuroprotective agent nxy-059 improves the distribution of acute stroke patient outcomes on the modified rankin scale (mrs) of global disability. ||| ",no
Can PLN mutations lead to dilated cardiomyopathy?,"mutations in the gene encoding pln have been associated with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy; however, no systematic search for pln mutations in heart failure has been conducted.  phospholamban (pln) is a key regulator of sr and cardiac function, and pln mutations in humans have been associated with dilated cardiomyopathy (dcm).  mutations in the phospholamban gene (pln) have been associated with primary cardiomyopathies.  a pathogenic variant in the gene encoding phospholamban (pln), a protein that regulates calcium homeostasis of cardiomyocytes, causes pln cardiomyopathy.  we performed sscp mutational screening and dna sequencing of the pln gene in 186 patients with either hypertrophic or dilated cardiomyopathy.  otherwise, mutations in the pln gene are not a frequent cause of cardiomyopathies in our population.  desmosomal and phospholamban (pln) mutations are associated with arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy.  the pln -42 c>g mutation is associated with a benign form of apical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in this family, though the presence of a healthy adult carrier suggests that other genetic and environmental factors could be involved.  pln mutation carriers more often had low-voltage electrocardiograms (p = 0.004), inverted t waves in leads v4 to v6 (p <0.001), and additional structural (p = 0.007) or functional (p = 0.017) left ventricular impairment, whereas desmosomal mutation carriers had more solitary right ventricular abnormalities.  molecular modeling studies suggested that r9l and r9h mutations might affect the region involved in protein kinase a docking and probably affect the mechanism modulating the release of phosphorylated pln from the substrate binding site of protein kinase a. mutations in the pln gene are a rare cause of heart failure, present almost exclusively in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy etiology.  cardiac beta-myosin heavy-chain missense mutations (ser532pro and phe764leu) and a deletion in cardiac troponin t (deltalys210) caused early-onset ventricular dilatation (average age at diagnosis, 24 years) and diminished contractile function and frequently resulted in heart failure.  the pln -42 c>g mutation was found in one patient with late onset familial apical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.  the heterozygous phospholamban p.arg14del mutation is found in patients with dilated or arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy.  some cases of familial dilated cardiomyopathy are caused by mutations in cardiac cytoskeletal proteins; this finding implicates defects in contractile-force transmission as one mechanism underlying this disorder.  dilated cardiomyopathy (dcm) is characterized by ventricular dilation associated with systolic dysfunction, which could be caused by mutations in lamina/c gene (lmna).  we screened a cohort of 1,014 brazilian patients with heart failure for mutations in the pln gene.  clinical information of the affected family members suggested that the mutation was associated with late onset cardiomyopathy.  mutations in sarcomere protein genes account for approximately 10 percent of cases of familial dilated cardiomyopathy and are particularly prevalent in families with early-onset ventricular dilatation and dysfunction.  a genetic locus for mutations associated with dilated cardiomyopathy was identified at chromosome 14q11.2-13 (maximal lod score, 5.11; theta=0), where the gene for cardiac beta-myosin heavy chain is encoded.  to screen for pln mutations in our population of patients with primary cardiomyopathies and to perform functional analysis of the mutations identified. ||| ",yes
Can Pentraxin 3 predict outcomes of sepsis?,"pentraxin-3 (ptx3) was shown to be associated with the severity and outcome of sepsis and septic shock.  pentraxin 3 (ptx3) has been suggested to be a prognostic marker of mortality in severe sepsis.  we have previously shown that multimers of plasma pentraxin-3 (ptx3) were predictive of survival in patients with sepsis.  pentraxin-3 (ptx3) may be a useful biomarker in sepsis, but its regulatory mechanisms are still unclear.  ptx-3 significantly predicts disease severity and mortality in sepsis.  however, the use of a single biomarker to predict patient outcomes is challenging owing to the complexity and redundancy of the immune response to infections.we aimed to conduct a prospective observational analysis to investigate the prognostic value of pentraxin 3, interleukin 6, procalcitonin, and lactate combined in predicting the 28-day mortality rate in patients with sepsis or septic shock (n = 160; sepsis, 78; sepsis shock, 82).  pentraxin 3 (ptx3), as a multifunctional pattern-recognition molecule, has been reported to be closely associated with the severity of infectious diseases in intensive care units (icu).  the pentraxin 3 level increased significantly after intracerebral hemorrhage and has an important predictive value for a prognosis for intracerebral hemorrhage mortality.  to investigate the behavior of pentraxin-3 (ptx3), troponin t (hstnt), n-terminal pro-b type natriuretic peptide (nt-probnp) in sepsis and their relationships with sepsis severity and oxygen transport/utilization impairment.  ptx3 correlated with severity of sepsis and peaked earlier than crp in patients with confirmed vap.  this study was carried out to investigate the diagnostic and prognostic value of ptx3 in patients with sepsis and septic shock based on sepsis 3.0 definitions.  the prognostic value of the acute phase protein pentraxin 3 (ptx-3) is not well evaluated in patients with septic shock, which reveal an unacceptably high short- and long-term mortality.  the purpose of this study is to investigate the level of pentraxin 3 in serum and its impact on prognosis in 307 patients with intracerebral hemorrhage.  the long pentraxin ptx3 is a key component of the humoral arm of innate immunity related to sepsis severity and mortality.  pentraxin 3 is considered an important inflammatory marker is known to increase in patients with ischemic stroke, but the relationship between pentraxin 3 and intracerebral hemorrhage mortality is unclear.  therefore, this study assesses the prognostic value of ptx-3 for short- and mid-term mortality in patients with sepsis or septic shock, as defined by the latest definitions, treated at a medical intensive care unit (icu).  the aim was to assess the diagnostic and prognostic value of measuring pentraxin 3 (ptx3) together with c-reactive protein (crp) in patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia (vap).  ptx3 may be a robust biomarker to classify the disease severity and predict the 90-day mortality of sepsis and septic shock based on the latest sepsis 3.0 definitions.  ptx-3 offers prognostic value for the prediction of short- and mid-term all-cause mortality in patients suffering from sepsis and septic shock according to the latest sepsis-3 criteria.  recent studies indicate that high levels of ptx3 may be associated with mortality in sepsis. ||| ",yes
Can Preimplantation Genetic Diagnosis (PGD) be used for gender selection?,"pgd has already been used to select embryos of a desired gender in the absence of any history of sex-linked genetic disease.  preimplantation genetic diagnosis (pgd) was introduced at the beginning of the 1990s as an alternative to prenatal diagnosis, to prevent termination of pregnancy in couples with a high risk for offspring affected by a sex-linked genetic disease.  preimplantation genetic diagnosis (pgd) permits the selection of embryos of a particular genotype prior to implantation.  performance of preimplantation genetic diagnosis per request specifically for gender selection by an infertile couple undergoing medically indicated assisted reproductive technique may not breach the principles of ethics, and is unlikely to alter the population balance of sexes.  here, we examine the clinical and ethical issues to be considered prior to offering pgd gender selection to reduce the risk of a child being affected by a non-mendelian condition with unequal sex incidence.  preimplantation genetic diagnosis (pgd) is an increasingly common adjunct to ivf.  preimplantation genetic diagnosis (pgd) has proven to be a useful reproductive option for carriers of some chromosome rearrangements.  eugenic selection of embryos is now possible by employing in vitro fertilization (ivf) and preimplantation genetic diagnosis (pgd).  preimplantation genetic diagnosis (pgd) was originally developed for couples whose potential offspring were at risk of severe mendelian disorders, but has since been extended to other indications.  in an attempt to identify x-linked mutation-free embryos for transfer, the present authors introduced preimplantation genetic diagnosis (pgd), using a sequential first and second polar body analysis, as an alternative to gender determination.  one possible use of pgd is to perform gender selection for couples whose offspring are at increased risk of disorders that do not follow mendelian inheritance, but which are substantially more common in one sex than another (unequal sex incidence).  preimplantation genetic diagnosis (pgd) is a novel procedure whose use may be considered to obtain a very early prenatal diagnosis for couples at risk for transmitting genetic diseases.  the use of preimplantation genetic diagnosis (pgd) to select genetically 'normal' human embryos and to transfer them to the uterus of a woman has generated considerable controversy.  the purpose of this article is to ascertain and appraise the ethical issues inherent to the utilisation of preimplantation genetic diagnosis for gender selection in infertile patients anticipating undergoing a medically indicated assisted reproductive technique procedure.  preimplantation genetic diagnosis (pgd) is an increasingly common adjunct to ivf and is used to evaluate the genetic makeup of the embryo prior to transfer of the embryo into the uterus.  preimplantation genetic diagnosis (pgd) was originally developed to diagnose embryo-related genetic abnormalities for couples who present a high risk of a specific inherited disorder.  an analysis of these issues in the context of using pgd for selecting embryos unaffected by a serious disorder and for sex selection is presented.  preimplantation genetic diagnosis (pgd) can be offered as an alternative to prenatal diagnosis (pnd) to couples at risk of having a child with a genetic disease.  preimplantation genetic diagnosis (pgd), used in clinical practice, is offered to couples that may suffer from a monogenetic disorder, chromosome aneuploidy, or x-linked disease.  recently, preimplantation genetic diagnosis (pgd) has been considered for several indications beyond its original purpose, not only to test embryos for genetic disease but also to select embryos for a nondisease trait, such as specific human leukocyte antigen (hla) genotypes, related to immune compatibility with an existing affected child in need of a haematopoetic stem cell (hsc) transplant. ||| ",yes
Can RG7112 inhibit MDM2?,"rg7112 is a small-molecule mdm2 antagonist.  rg7112 binds mdm2 with high affinity (k(d) ~ 11 nmol/l), blocking its interactions with p53 in vitro.  rg7388 (idasanutlin) is a potent inhibitor of oncoprotein murine double minute 2 (mdm2).  rg7112 is a potent and selective member of the nutlin family of mdm2 antagonists currently in phase i clinical studies.  rg7112 showed potent antitumor activity against a panel of solid tumor cell lines.  a crystal structure of the rg7112-mdm2 complex revealed that the small molecule binds in the p53 pocket of mdm2, mimicking the interactions of critical p53 amino acid residues.  in a previous communication, the efforts leading to the identification of a non-imidazoline mdm2 inhibitor, rg7388, was disclosed and revealed the desirable in vitro and in vivo pharmacological properties that this class of pyrrolidine-based inhibitors possesses.  notably, rg7388 treatment remains effective in tumors lacking mdm2 amplification but expressing wild-type p53.  daily treatment of rg7388 in mice at 50 and 80 mg/kg/day inhibited tumor growth in three wild-type p53 pdx models.  our results suggest that rg7388 is a promising molecular scaffold for 18f-labeled probe development for mdm2.  herein we investigated the feasibility of developing 18f-labeled rg7388 as a radiotracer for imaging mdm2 expression in tumors with positron emission tomography (pet).  oral administration of rg7112 to human xenograft-bearing mice at nontoxic concentrations caused dose-dependent changes in proliferation/apoptosis biomarkers as well as tumor inhibition and regression.  our findings offer a preclinical proof-of-concept that rg7112 is effective in treatment of solid tumors expressing wild-type p53.  mdm2 inhibition resulted in p53 stabilization and transcriptional activation of p53-target genes.  we evaluated the antitumor activity of the small-molecule mdm2 inhibitor rg7388 in patient-derived xenograft (pdx) models of nsclc.  we demonstrated that rg7388 promotes low nanomolar antiproliferative activity selectively in cell lines with wild-type p53 and p53 pathway activation, resulting in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.  notably, rg7112 was highly synergistic with androgen deprivation in lncap xenograft tumors.  mdm2 negatively regulates p53 stability and many human tumors overproduce mdm2 as a mechanism to restrict p53 function.  inhibition of the interaction between mdm2 and p53 proteins is a promising anticancer therapy.  we provide an outlook into the future for therapy based on mdm2 inhibition by presenting an overview of the most relevant patents which have recently appeared in the literature. ||| ",yes
Can RNAPolII function as an RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase?,"rna polymerase ii (pol ii) is a well-characterized dna-dependent rna polymerase, which has also been reported to have rna-dependent rna polymerase (rdrp) activity.  rna polymerase (pol) ii catalyses dna-dependent rna synthesis during gene transcription.  there is, however, evidence that pol ii also possesses rna-dependent rna polymerase (rdrp) activity.  in support of this conjecture, we describe here an rna molecule that catalyzes the type of polymerization needed for rna replication.  the rna polymerase ii (pol ii) is a eukaryotic enzyme that catalyzes the synthesis of the messenger rna using a dna template.  pol ii can use a homopolymeric rna template, can extend rna by several nucleotides in the absence of dna, and has been implicated in the replication of the rna genomes of hepatitis delta virus (hdv) and plant viroids.  cellular dna-dependent rna polymerase ii (pol ii) has been postulated to carry out rna-dependent rna replication and transcription of hepatitis delta virus (hdv) rna, generating a full-length (1.7-kb) rna genome and a subgenomic-length (0.8-kb) mrna.  here we show the intrinsic rdrp activity of pol ii with only pure polymerase, an rna template-product scaffold and nucleoside triphosphates (ntps).  here, we demonstrate for the first time that the influenza virus rna polymerase complex interacts with the large subunit of pol ii via its c-terminal domain.  some features of this reaction resemble the rna cleavage-extension process observed for pol ii-arrested complexes in vitro.  the poly(da).oligo(u)-dependent rna polymerase activity can be detected in crude cell extracts from a variety of tissue culture cells and appears to be largely due to polymerase ii, since 90-95% of this activity is inhibited by alpha-amanitin at a concentration of 1 microgram/ml.  here, rnapii collision was characterized using a reconstituted system for simultaneous transcription by two polymerases.  transcription by the influenza virus rna-dependent rna polymerase is dependent on cellular rna processing activities that are known to be associated with cellular rna polymerase ii (pol ii) transcription, namely, capping and splicing.  therefore, it had been hypothesized that transcription by the viral rna polymerase and pol ii might be functionally linked.  here we describe a highly purified system that allows for efficient activator-dependent transcription by rna polymerase ii from the promoter through several contiguous nucleosomes on defined chromatin templates.  the present findings provide a framework for further studies to elucidate the mechanistic principles of transcription by a viral rna polymerase and have implications for the regulation of pol ii activities in infected cells.  these studies support the interpretation that a host polymerase, most likely rna polymerase ii, can not only carry out transcription that is rna directed, but also achieve template switching on a discontinuous rna template, and even perform non-templated nucleotide incorporation.  rna in such rna-rna polymerase complexes undergoes reactions previously thought to be unique to nascent rna in ternary complexes with dna, including tfiis-dependent cleavage and elongation by 3'-terminal addition of nmp from ntp.  the mechanism which enables polymerase ii to use rna as a template is unclear.  a sensitive assay for detection of eukaryotic rna polymerase ii has been developed. ||| ",yes
Can RNASeq be used for the analysis of nascent transcripts?,"rna-seq is an approach to transcriptome profiling that uses deep-sequencing technologies to detect and accurately quantify rna molecules originating from a genome at a given moment in time.  rna-seq is a recently developed sequencing technology, that through the analysis of cdna allows for unique insights into the transcriptome of a cell.  rna sequencing, or (rna-seq for short,, is a widely applied technology that for extractings gene and transcript expression from biological samples.  qualitative and quantitative analysis of small non-coding rnas by next generation sequencing (smallrna-seq) represents a novel technology increasingly used to investigate with high sensitivity and specificity rna population comprising micrornas and other regulatory small transcripts.  rna-seq is revolutionizing the way we study transcriptomes.  rna sequencing (rna-seq) has become a powerful tool to understand molecular mechanisms and/or developmental programs.  however, the profiling of nascent transcripts, which often include nonpolyadenylated rnas, can unveil novel insights into transcriptional regulation.  genome-wide profiling of nascent rna has become a fundamental tool to study transcription regulation.  rna-seq, a next-generation sequencing based method for transcriptome analysis, is rapidly emerging as the method of choice for comprehensive transcript abundance estimation.  furthermore, nascent rna-seq detects post-cleavage rna at termination sites and promoter-associated antisense rnas, providing insights into rna polymerase ii (rnapii) dynamics and processivity.  recent advances in rna sequencing technology (rna-seq) enables comprehensive profiling of rnas by producing millions of short sequence reads from size-fractionated rna libraries.  however, it is unclear whether these state-of-the-art rna-seq analysis pipelines can quantify small rnas as accurately as they do with long rnas in the context of total rna quantification.  rna-seq, the application of next-generation sequencing to rna, provides transcriptome-wide characterization of cellular activity.  analysis of smallrna-seq data to gather biologically relevant information, i.e.  especially for non-model organisms and in absence of a reference genome, rna-seq data is used to reconstruct and quantify transcriptomes at the same time.  in summary, rna-seqc provides quality control measures critical to experiment design, process optimization and downstream computational analysis.  unlike steady-state rna-sequencing (rna-seq), nascent rna profiling mirrors real-time activity of rna polymerases and provides an accurate readout of transcriptome-wide variations.  here we present norahdesk, the first unbiased and universally applicable method for small ncrnas detection from rna-seq data.  rna-seqc allows investigators to make informed decisions about sample inclusion in downstream analysis.  the accuracy of rna-seq can be highly impacted by the purity of samples. ||| ",yes
Can SUMO affect calcium homeostasis?,"this review summarizes the physiology and pathophysiology of calcium homeostasis.  alterations in calcium systems may underlie some of the physiological changes associated with aging.  calcium plays a major role in regulating cellular function.  to obtain further information on the negative calcium balance caused by cd, the factors associated with serum calcium and phosphorus homeostasis other than inhibition of intestinal calcium absorption were studied by using urinary cyclic 3',4'-adenosine monophosphate (camp).  calcium homeostasis is described in terms of controlled, disturbing, and controlling signals.  little attention has been given to the consequences of the in vivo calcium status on intracellular calcium homeostasis despite several pathological states induced by perturbations of the in vivo calcium balance.  a disturbance in the levels of calcium in these compartments can play havoc in the cell, as it regulates various cellular processes by direct or indirect mechanisms.  calcium (ca) and magnesium (mg) homeostasis are interrelated and share common regulatory hormones, including parathyroid hormone (pth) and vitamin d. however, the role of the calcium-sensing receptor (casr) in mg homeostasis in vivo is not well understood.  recent and limited findings have prompted concern about the contribution of calcium supplementation to cardiovascular risk.  in multivariable models, dietary calcium and prescribed calcium were associated in opposing directions with serum calcium (prescribed calcium; ß-coefficient = -0.35, p = 0.005 versus dietary calcium; ß-coefficient = 0.35, p = 0.03).  the aim of this study was to evaluate alterations in calcium metabolism in sarcoidosis.  in conclusion, a disease-related alteration in calcium metabolism was seen in about 40% of patients with sarcoidosis, and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin d probably plays a crucial role in this abnormality.  the effects of calcium deficiency on cellular calcium homeostasis were reversible by repletion with oral calcium feeding alone or by the administration of the calcium-regulating hormone 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin d3, further strengthening the tight link between extra- and intracellular calcium.  these data, therefore, challenge the currently prevailing hypothesis that extracellular ca2+ has no significant impact on cellular ca2+ by demonstrating that despite the large ca2+ gradient between extra- and intracellular ca2+ concentrations, calcium deficiency in vivo significantly alters the hormone-sensitive cellular calcium homeostasis.  dietary calcium was associated with higher serum calcium and lower fgf23 concentrations, while prescribed calcium was only inversely associated with serum calcium.  this phenomenon indicated hyperparathyroidemia in response to continuous oral administration of cd for 90 d. the negative calcium balance with hyperparathyroidemia occurred after continuous oral administration of cd and developed via increased urinary excretion of calcium.  dietary calcium was inversely associated with fgf23 (p = 0.04) however association of fgf23 with prescribed calcium did not reach statistical significance (0.08).  the correlation between the alterations of free intracellular calcium concentrations and the essential arterial hypertension has been largely investigated.  dysregulated serum calcium and fgf23 are associated with increased mortality and morbidity rates in patients receiving hemodialysis.  one third is in need of mg conservation by the kidney, associated with low plasma total mg, modest metabolic acidosis, a trend towards overweight, high plasma insulin and glucose; 2) low mg- or acidosis-induced increase of bone resorption may follow, attenuating glycemia and insulinemia but forcing the kidney to functional adaptation, manifesting as a rise of urinary sodium, mg, ca, pi, ca/pi, ph and protein, together presumably aggravating ma; 3) larger controlled studies are justified, to decide whether mg deficiency initiates renal ca stones, and if urinary mg loss exaggerates ircu. ||| ",yes
Can a given genotype exhibit opposite fitness effects (beneficial and detrimental) within the same environment?,"however, alleles affecting traits like sex, evolvability, and cooperation can cause fitness effects that depend heavily on differences in the environmental, social, and genetic context of individuals carrying the allele.  such trait-specific dominance has been studied previously in models for the maintenance of genetic variation by antagonistic effects of an allele on two fitness components.  the effects of mutation and demography may generate population differences in overall levels of antagonistic fitness variation, as well as molecular population genetic signatures of balancing selection.  understanding how interactions among deleterious mutations affect fitness may shed light on a variety of fundamental biological phenomena, including the evolution of sex, the buffering of genetic variations, and the topography of fitness landscapes.  in this study it is hypothesized that modulation of different traits would have contrasting relevance for the fitness of populations of diverse origins.  if a mutation has opposite effects on fitness when expressed in different contexts, then genetic conflict arises.  mutations beneficial in one environment may cause costs in different environments, resulting in antagonistic pleiotropy.  it is concluded that modulation of a functional trait can be relevant to fitness in a given population (i.e.  tradeoffs in performance or fitness across environments have important implications regarding the nature of evolutionary constraints.  yet selection acts on phenotypes, not additive genetic variance alone, meaning that persistence and evolutionary potential in the near term, at least, may be influenced by other sources of fitness variation, including nonadditive genetic and maternal environmental effects.  because the phenotypic optima of males and females often differ, the fitness consequences of newly arisen alleles might not be concordant between the sexes and can be sexually antagonistic--genetic variants favored in one sex are deleterious in the other.  environmental features can alter the behaviors and phenotypes of organisms, influencing the dynamics of natural and sexual selection.  by generalizing these models to an arbitrary number of fitness components or other phenotypic traits with different degrees of dominance, i show that genetic polymorphism is generally impossible without antagonistic fitness effects of different traits and without trait-specific dominance.  nonadditivity in fitness effects from two or more mutations, termed epistasis, can result in compensation of deleterious mutations or negation of beneficial mutations.  depending on the genetic architecture of male and female fitness, sex-specific selection can have negative, positive, or neutral consequences for the opposite sex.  we found that mildly deleterious mutations interacted synergistically in poor-resource environments but antagonistically in rich-resource environments.  however, if such long-term genetic constraints do exist, they must be due to underlying pleiotropy such that alleles that confer high performance in one environment invariably confer low performance in another.  antagonistic selection--where alleles at a locus have opposing effects on male and female fitness (""sexual antagonism"") or between components of fitness (""antagonistic pleiotropy"")--might play an important role in maintaining population genetic variation and in driving phylogenetic and genomic patterns of sexual dimorphism and life-history evolution.  one genotype develops rapidly and has superior viability but reduced fertility relative to the alternative genotype.  experimental environmental manipulation, particularly when conducted in experiments where the dynamics of the purging of deleterious alleles are compared, has demonstrated both direct and indirect effects on the strength and direction of selection. ||| ",yes
Can a peptide aptamer be used as protein inhibitor?,"peptide aptamers are molecules which can specifically bind to a given target protein and have the potential to selectively block the function of the target protein.  combined, our results demonstrate that peptide aptamers generated by yeast two-hybrid methods can serve as inhibitory reagents to target specific proteins in vivo.  these aptamers have the potential to dominantly interfere with specific activities of their target proteins and, therefore, could be used as in vivo inhibitors.  peptide aptamers can disrupt specific protein interactions and thus represent a useful method for manipulating protein function in vivo.  peptide aptamers represent a new basis for drug design and protein therapy, with implications for basic and applied research, for a broad variety of different types of diseases.  peptide aptamers are peptides constrained and presented by a scaffold protein that are used to study protein function in cells.  peptide aptamers are combinatorial protein molecules with specific bind affinity to given target proteins under intracellular conditions.  in vitro-selected rna aptamers are potential inhibitors of disease-related proteins.  due to the importance of peptide aptamers, a general review on the structure, selection and applications of peptide aptamers in biological study as well as in therapeutics will be presented in this paper.  peptide aptamers have also been considered as therapeutic molecules because of their anticancer and antivirus activity.  peptide aptamers are combinatorial protein reagents that bind to targets with a high specificity and a strong affinity thus providing a molecular tool kit for modulating the function of their targets in vivo.  rna aptamers are capable of inhibiting proteins with high affinity and specificity, but this effect is not readily reversible.  peptide aptamers comprise a new class of molecules, with a peptide moiety of randomized sequence, which are selected for their ability to bind to a given target protein under intracellular conditions.  peptide aptamers are small combinatorial proteins that are selected to bind to specific sites on their target molecules.  peptide aptamers have emerged as powerful new tools for molecular medicine.  this unique structural feature allows peptide aptamers to bind with their target proteins with strong affinity and high specificity.  we found an aptamer that strongly inhibits ptp1b in vitro with a ki of less than 600 pm.  four peptides with significantly decreased modification in the presence of the aptamer were identified and subjected to n-terminal sequence analysis.  we describe a general method for discovering aptamers that bind and inhibit their target protein, but addition of a specific small molecule disrupts the protein-rna complex.  various peptide aptamer scaffolds and in vitro and in vivo selection techniques are reviewed with emphasis on specific biomedical, bioimaging, and bioanalytical applications. ||| ",yes
Can acupuncture cause spinal epidural hematoma?,"in this report we compare our case of an extremely uncommon spinal epidural hematoma, which appeared after treatment by acupuncture, with other similar documented cases.  although a post-acupuncture spinal epidural hematoma (paseh) is very rare, there are only 6 documented cases, it is a possible complication from acupuncture on the back.  spinal acupuncture is a relatively safe and common analgesic treatment, but it may be complicated by serious adverse effects, such as direct spinal cord and nerve root injury, subdural empyema, and epidural abscesses.  the authors report the case of a 64-year-old woman who experienced thoracic epidural hematoma during a session of spinal manipulation therapy (smt).  this study reports a case of epidural hematoma that occurred in the anterior spinal cord after cervical massage.  we present the first report of spinal epidural hematoma occurring after chiropractic manipulation in a healthy young adult without preexisting cervical disease or any obvious predisposing factors.  spinal epidural hematoma is a rare but potentially devastating complication of spinal manipulation therapy.  this case represents the first spinal epidural hematoma occurring after a chiropractic manipulation in the lumbar region.  this study reports a case of thoracic spinal epidural hematoma following spinal manipulative therapy in the absence of predisposing factors.  spinal epidural hematoma is a rare complication associated with pain control procedures such as facet block, acupuncture, epidural injection, etc.  spinal epidural hematoma after spinal puncture such as for injection of steroids for pain management may result in a rare complication of a spinal epidural hematoma causing acute myelopathy.  this is a case report of a healthy pregnant female who presented to the emergency department with a cervical epidural hematoma resulting from chiropractic spinal manipulation therapy that responded to conservative treatment rather than the more common route of surgical management.  the onset of severe spinal pain after spinal or paraspinal acupuncture treatment should lead to the suspicion of a paseh, and a spinal mri should be carried out.  spinal epidural hematoma is a rare complication of chiropractic manipulation.  herein, we report on a patient who developed a lumbar epidural hematoma after receiving caudal epidural prf stimulation.  spinal epidural hematoma is a rare, but potentially devastating, consequence of accessing the epidural space for anesthesia or interventional pain procedures.  this case report presents the development of an epidural hematoma after lumbar transforaminal epidural steroid injection in a patient who has anatomical risk factor of severe lumbar spinal stenosis.  complications of smt are reviewed, and the etiology and features of spinal epidural hematoma are discussed.  we report four patients with epidural hematoma developed after pain control procedures.  this is the first reported case of aspirin leading to an epidural hematoma following an interventional chronic pain procedure. ||| ",yes
Can administration of the thyrotropin releasing hormone reduce fatigue in cancer patients?,"research on determinants of well-being in patients on thyroid hormone replacement therapy is warranted, as persistent fatigue-related complaints are common in this population.  inhibition of thyrotropin (tsh) release by chronic treatment with small quantities of triiodothyronine (t(3)) and thyroxine (t(4)) was evaluated by determining the serum tsh response to thyrotropin-releasing hormone (trh) in normal subjects and hypothyroid patients.  long-term thyroid hormone (th) therapy aiming at the suppression of serum thyrotropin (tsh) has been traditionally used in the management of well differentiated thyroid cancer (thyrca).  suppression of thyroid stimulating hormone (tsh) below the normal range with administration of l-thyroxine has been shown to improve survival in patients treated for thyroid cancer (tc).  it was recently demonstrated that treatment with levorotatory thyroxine (t4) plus triiodothyronine (t3) compared with treatment with t4 alone improves psychologic functioning in hypothyroid patients with thyroid cancer or autoimmune thyroiditis.  furthermore, the relationship between fatigue and the tsh receptor (tshr)-asp727glu polymorphism, a common genetic variant of the tshr, was analyzed.  suppression of thyrotropin (often referred to as thyroid-stimulating hormone, or tsh) with levothyroxine used in management of intermediate- and high-risk differentiated thyroid cancer (dtc) to reduce the likelihood of progression and death is based on conflicting evidence.  temporary thyroid hormone withdrawal has previously been used, but causes hypothyroidism and, rarely, tumor progression.  patients with thyroid cancer benefit from treatment with exogenous thyroid hormone for two reasons: it provides adequate levels of thyroid hormone to peripheral tissues, and it reduces the level of thyrotropin, which may be an important growth factor in patients with differentiated malignant neoplasms.  therefore, we evaluated quality of life in patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma (dtc) on tsh-suppressive thyroxine therapy as a model for subclinical hyperthyroidism and we investigated whether restoration to euthyroidism affects quality of life.  in this study, we evaluated the impact of different states of hypothyroidism on fatigue and fatigue-related symptoms.  to detect recurrent disease in patients who have had differentiated thyroid cancer, periodic withdrawal of thyroid hormone therapy may be required to raise serum thyrotropin concentrations to stimulate thyroid tissue so that radioiodine (iodine-131) scanning can be performed.  suppression therapy of thyreostimulin (tsh) using thyroid hormones improves survival of subjects operated for differentiated thyroid cancer.  thyrotropin stimulates radioiodine uptake for scanning in patients with thyroid cancer, but the sensitivity of scanning after the administration of thyrotropin is less than that after the withdrawal of thyroid hormone.  depressive symptomatology improved with thyroxine.  the mean serum total t4 and free t4 concentrations increased significantly in both groups after thyroxine therapy (p < 0.01), the serum total triiodothyronine (t3) level did not change (p > 0.05), and the serum thyrotropin level (tsh) and t3/t4 ratio decreased markedly (p < 0.01).  the elevation of thyroid-stimulating hormone, or thyrotropin (tsh), that occurs with hypothyroidism stimulates uptake of radioiodine in normal and cancerous thyroid tissues.  levothyroxine suppression of thyrotropin (tsh) is broadly applied to patients with thyroid cancer despite lack of consensus on the optimal tsh concentration necessary to reduce cancer recurrence while minimizing toxicity from subclinical hyperthyroidism.  aih patients had significantly higher levels of fatigue compared with dtc patients, which could not be attributed to clinical or thyroid hormone parameters.  the modest effect of the tshr-asp727glu polymorphism on fatigue was found in dtc patients only. ||| ",yes
Can adult humans be induced to produce fetal hemoglobin?,"fetal hemoglobin production can be reactivated in vivo in adult persons with various hemoglobinopathies and other hemopoietic disorders, and in cultures of adult erythroid progenitors.  some experimental results have suggested that these diseases could be treated by induction of fetal-type hemoglobin (hbf).  therapeutic induction of fetal hemoglobin (hbf) is one of the most promising approaches to ameliorate the severity of hemoglobinopathies like β-thalassemia and sickle cell anemia.  increasing fetal hemoglobin (hbf) levels in adult humans remains an active area in hematologic research.  fetal hemoglobin production in adult human erythroid progenitors can be influenced by exogenous factors.  some pharmacological agents, such as hydroxycarbamide (hc), can increase fetal haemoglobin synthesis during adult life.  increased fetal hemoglobin (hb f; alpha(2)gamma(2)) production in adults can ameliorate the clinical severity of sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia major.  the ontogenic switch from fetal to adult hemoglobin could be due to gradual replacement of fetal by adult erythroid progenitor cells, each with unique potential hemoglobin expression programs.  increased fetal hemoglobin (hbf) in erythroid precursors of patients with beta-hemoglobinopathies (sickle cell anemia and beta-thalassemia), in which adult hemoglobin synthesis is defective, ameliorates the clinical symptoms of the underlying diseases.  fetal cells at 70-75 days gestation continue to synthesize only fetal hemoglobin, whereas cells from 100-day gestation fetuses appear to rapidly switch to adult hemoglobin production after transplantation.  these results provide direct in vivo evidence that fetal-globin expression in the adult is controlled at the level of erythroid progenitors.  to investigate whether the level of maturity of human erythroid cells influences the expression of the fetal hemoglobin program, we studied the relative production of fetal (hb f) and adult (hb a) hemoglobins during the maturation of erythroid clones produced in vitro by adult or neonatal erythroid stem cells.  clonal erythroid cultures have been used in the investigation of the cellular mechanisms underlying the switch from fetal to adult hb formation during ontogeny and the expression of fetal hemoglobin in adult life.  increased expression of fetal haemoglobin (hbf) may ameliorate the clinical course of beta-thalassemia and sickle cell disease.  adult erythroid progenitors produce significantly higher fetal hemoglobin (hbf) levels in cultures containing fetal calf serum (fcs) and erythropoietin (ep) than in vivo.  the most direct available approach to determine the cellular control of the switch from fetal to adult hemoglobin is to examine the pattern of hemoglobin synthesis by fetal hemopoietic cells after their transplantation to an adult animal.  a recent theory of the control of human fetal hemoglobin synthesis, based on studies in cultured adult marrow, proposes that the phenotypic expression of fetal hemoglobin is largely dependent on the level of differentiation of the parental stem cells; that is, the earlier the progenitor, the greater the ability of its progeny to express fetal hemoglobin  to test directly whether the control of fetal hemoglobin (hbf) in the adult takes place at the level of erythroid progenitors or at the level of erythroblasts, we treated animals with high doses of erythropoietin and examined the effects of this manipulation on the globin gene programs of erythroid progenitors.  although erythroid cells prepared from fetal liver, cord blood, or blood from β-thalassemia patients are known to express fetal hemoglobin at high levels, the underlying mechanisms remain elusive.  these data suggest that erythroblast targeting of lin28a expression is sufficient for increasing fetal hemoglobin expression in adult human erythroblasts. ||| ",yes
Can beans induce apoptosis?,"phenolics in common beans modulate 28 proteins related to apoptotic processes.  two varieties of common beans (phaseolus vulgaris l.), bayo victoria and negro 8025, were evaluated to determine the effect on cellular viability and mechanisms involved in apoptosis pathways, using a cellular model with ht-29 cells.  practical applications: polyphenols in common beans (phaseolus vulgaris l.) cultivars processed by canning display chemoprotective potential as they activate mechanisms involved in apoptosis pathways.  the objective of this study was to determine whether consumption of black beans and/or navy beans would reduce colon carcinogenesis in rats.  it was concluded that eating black beans and navy beans significantly lowered colon cancer incidence and multiplicity.  beans (phaseolus vulgaris) contain bioactive components with functional properties that may modify cardiovascular risk.  proteins related to the arrest of cell cycle were modulated by both bean cultivars.  there is limited evidence to suggest an inverse relationship between bean consumption and colon cancer.  beans (phaseolus vulgaris) are an important food staple in many traditional diets.  this research evaluated the effect of germination of black beans (phaseolus vulgaris l.) on the antioxidant capacity and antiproliferative activity against cancer cell lines of saponins and flavonoids extracted from seed coats, cotyledons and sprouts.  rats were fed a modified ain-93g diet (control) or diets containing 75% black beans or 75% navy beans for 4 wk, and then colon cancer was initiated by administration of two injections of azoxymethane 1 wk apart.  diets containing beans have been associated with a lower risk of obesity and overweight in several dietary surveys.  these results suggest that both the soluble and the insoluble fraction of the extract contribute to the cancer-protective effect of cooked navy beans.  therefore, a diet including canned beans (particularly darker varieties) might represent health benefits and cancer-preventive effects.  there was greater vasorelaxation 6 h following consumption of darker-coloured beans, as shown by decreased vascular tone: pwv was lower after consuming black bean compared to pinto bean, augmentation pressure was lower after consuming black bean compared to rice and pinto bean, and wave reflection magnitude was lower after consuming red kidney bean and black bean compared to rice, navy bean, and pinto bean (p < 0.05).  the 44-75% reduction in colon carcinogenesis in rats fed beans was attributed to 1) more controlled appetites, leading to significantly less body fat, and 2) much greater concentrations of butyrate in the distal colon.  based on the protective effects of cooked dry bean consumption in a human intervention study, we evaluated which fraction of cooked dry beans is responsible for its cancer-preventive effects.  cafestol-induced apoptosis is associated with the reduction of mitochondrial membrane potential (mmp), activation of caspase 3, cytochrome c release, and down-regulation of anti-apoptotic proteins (bcl-2, bcl-xl, mcl-1 and cflip).  flavonoids and saponins from common beans have been widely studied due to their bioactivity.  cafestol-induced apoptosis was blocked by pretreatment with broad caspase inhibitor z-vad-fmk, showing its dependence on caspases. ||| ",yes
Can bioprinting use human cells?,"bioprinting has become an important tool for fabricating regenerative implants and in vitro cell culture platforms.  because of its high resolution and the ability to print living cells, bioprinting has been widely used in artificial tissue and organ generation as well as microscale living cell deposition.  there are several types of bioprinters, especially inkjet-based bioprinter, which can be used not only as a printer for arranging cells but also as a precision cell-dispensing device with controlled cell numbers similar to a fluorescence activated cell sorter (facs).  bioprinting is an attractive technology for building tissues from scratch to explore entire new cell configurations, which brings numerous opportunities for biochemical research such as engineering tissues for therapeutic tissue repair or drug screening.  bioprinting is a powerful technology with the potential to transform medical device manufacturing, organ replacement, and the treatment of diseases and physiologic malformations.  bioprinting has recently appeared as a powerful tool for building complex tissue and organ structures.  bioprinting has already been widely applied to construct functional tissues such as vasculature, muscle, cartilage, and bone.  bioprinting is a promising emerging technology.  however, the application of bioprinting to regenerative medicine has limitations, due to the restricted choices of bio-ink for cytocompatible cell encapsulation and the integrity of the fabricated structures.  it is believed that such a strategy of bioprinting will provide many opportunities in convenient fabrication of 3d cell-laden constructs for applications in tissue engineering, regenerative medicine, and pharmaceutical screening.  bioprinting is an emerging technique for the fabrication of living tissues that allows cells to be arranged in predetermined three-dimensional (3d) architectures.  this work introduces direct bioprinting to be considered as a key factor above the main tissue engineering technologies.  bioprinting is a relatively new technology where living cells with or without biomaterials are printed layer-by-layer in order to create three-dimensional (3d) living structures.  bioprinting is an emerging technique for the fabrication of 3d cell-laden constructs.  although the biomaterials and cells to be used are being carefully studied, there is still a long way to go before a bioprinter can easily and quickly produce printings without harmful effects on the cells.  bioprinting is a rapidly developing technique for biofabrication.  purpose: this report explores the overlooked potential of bioprinting to automate biomanufacturing of simple tissue structures, such as the uniform deposition of (mono)layers of progenitor cells on sheetlike decellularized extracellular matrices (decm).  bioprinting technology is expected to be applied in the fields of regenerative medicine and drug discovery.  bioprinting as an enabling technology for tissue engineering possesses the promises to fabricate highly mimicked tissue or organs with digital control.  researchers are focusing on bioprinting technology as a viable option to overcome current difficulties in cartilage tissue engineering. ||| ",yes
Can botulism poisoning of a pregnant woman harm her fetus?,"given the natural physiological changes during pregnancy, pregnant women with botulism may experience a more exaggerated course and have worse outcomes compared to nonpregnant women.  maternal exposure during pregnancy to toxins can occasionally lead to miscarriage and malformation.  it is not uncommon for a medical provider caring for these women to mistakenly associate the signs and symptoms associated with botulism with pregnancy-related findings; therefore, this article illustrates a clinical algorithmic approach to caring for these women, including a systematic approach to establishing a diagnosis and management plan for pregnant women with botulism.  botulism is a severe neuroparalytic disease resulting from exposure to one of the most poisonous toxins to humans.  botulism is a dreadful, life-threatening, neuroparalytic disease caused by gram positive bacteria clostridium botulinum.  it is currently thought that toxins pass through the placental barrier, albeit bi-layered in the first trimester, and damage the fetus directly, albeit at low concentration.  toxicological findings of the liver, brain, and kidney of the fetus revealed carbofuran in concentrations comparable with the mother's blood.  acute organophosphorus pesticide poisoning during pregnancy may lead to spontaneous abortion.  botulism caused by toxins of clostridium botulinum and other neurotoxic clostridia is a rare but life-threatening disease with neurological symptoms.  envenomation during pregnancy can result in fetal and maternal death.  consequently, gestational lead poisoning is not only harmful to the woman but also to the developing fetus, invariably producing congenital lead poisoning.  botulinum neurotoxin serotype a (bonta) causes a life-threatening neuroparalytic disease known as botulism that could afflict large, unprotected populations if the toxin were employed in an act of bioterrorism.  a case of carbamate pesticide poisoning of a pregnant woman by carbofuran ingestion is presented.  it has been suggested that snakebite poisoning during pregnancy may cause fetal loss.  food borne botulism has been described following ingestion of preformed toxins in canned food or food products that have not been preserved properly.  botulism is a potentially fatal infection characterized by progressive muscle weakness, bulbar paralysis, constipation and other autonomic dysfunctions.  this article reviews the etiology, epidemiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and therapy of botulism.  this report documents a case of maternal typhoid fever with septic abortion, in which trans-placental infection of the fetus caused its demise.  food-borne botulism (food poisoning) is the most common type worldwide; rarely, wound botulism, infant botulism, or botulism of unknown etiology may also occur.  the mother recovered from the poisoning in the hospital but necrosis of the fetus was found. ||| ",no
Can canagliflozin cause euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis?,"treatment with canagliflozin was associated with development of euglycemic ketoacidosis.  we report the presentation and management of two cases of canagliflozin associated diabetic ketoacidosis (dka) and discuss the mechanism of canagliflozin associated dka.  a 52-year-old man with type 2 diabetes mellitus developed profound ketoacidosis without overt hyperglycemia while taking canagliflozin.  we describe a case in which a patient experienced difficult-to-treat metabolic ketoacidosis in the setting of canagliflozin use.  we are reporting a timely case of atypical euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis in a type 1 diabetic patient treated with sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (sglt-2) inhibitor canagliflozin.  the potential for canagliflozin to cause clinical drug-drug interactions (ddis) was assessed.  however, drug interactions with canagliflozin can affect its glucoselowering therapeutic effects or exacerbate its adverse effects.  euglycemic ketoacidosis did not recur in our patient after discontinuing canagliflozin.  this study evaluated renal and non-renal effects of canagliflozin on postprandial plasma glucose (pg) excursion in patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with metformin.  these findings indicate that canagliflozin appears to impede ischemic peripheral tissue recovery and warrant further clinical investigation in individuals with diabetes and a history of peripheral artery disease.  canagliflozin is a recently approved drug for use in the treatment of type 2 diabetes.  ketoacidosis resolved after increasing dextrose and insulin doses supporting the hypothesis that sglt-2 inhibitors may lead to hypoinsulinemia.  canagliflozin is a novel drug for diabetes mellitus with the mechanisms of inducing glucosuria through inhibition of the sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 in the kidney independent of insulin activity.  canagliflozin lowers blood glucose levels independently of insulin, with the inhibition of sglt2 reducing renal reabsorption of glucose and increasing excretion of glucose in the urine.  systemic exposure to canagliflozin increased in the renal impairment groups relative to participants with normal renal function.  to the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of canagliflozin-associated acute pancreatitis in clinical literature.  canagliflozin improves glycemic control in an insulin-independent fashion through inhibition of glucose reuptake in the kidney.  canagliflozin, a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor indicated for lowering glucose, has been increasingly used in diabetes patients because of its beneficial effects on cardiovascular and renal outcomes.  canagliflozin was generally well tolerated, had a low risk of hypoglycaemia and was most commonly associated with adverse events such as genital and urinary tract infections and increased urination, consistent with its mechanism of action.  there is a reported increased incidence of lower extremity amputations in individuals with diabetes who are treated with canagliflozin (an sglt2 receptor inhibitor). ||| ",yes
Can cffDNA be used for non-invasive testing?,"nowadays, new advances in the use of cell free fetal dna (cffdna) in maternal plasma of pregnant women has provided the possibility of applying cffdna in prenatal diagnosis as a non-invasive method.  noninvasive genetic tests that use cell-free fetal dna (cffdna) are used increasingly in prenatal care.  the feasibility of using ccfdna as a diagnostic biomarker requires further examination.  detection of cell-free fetal dna (cffdna) in maternal plasma has given rise to the possibility of new non-invasive approaches for early prenatal diagnoses.  circulating cell-free dna (cfdna) is probably the most promising tool among all components of liquid biopsy.  circulating cell-free dna (ccfdna) has great potential for non-invasive diagnostics, and prediction and monitoring of treatment response, but its amount is usually limited.  cell-free dna (cfdna) testing has recently become indispensable in diagnostic testing and screening.  circulating cell-free dna (ccfdna) has great potential for non-invasive diagnosis, prognosis and monitoring treatment of disease.  using non-invasive method of cffdnas in the shortest time possible, as well as avoiding invasive tests for early determination of fetal gender, provides the opportunity of deciding and employing early treatment for fetuses at risk of genetic diseases.  non-invasive prenatal diagnosis (nipd) makes use of cell-free fetal dna (cffdna) in the mother's bloodstream as an alternative to invasive sampling methods such as amniocentesis or cvs, which carry a 0.5-1% risk of fetal loss.  analysis of cfdna is a minimally invasive procedure that might better reflect tumor heterogeneity and allows repeated testing over the time.  although cell-free dna (cfdna) tests have emerged as a potential non-invasive alterative for bone marrow biopsies in monitoring of clonal hematopoiesis (ch) in hematologic diseases, whether commercial cfdna assays can be implemented for de novo ch detection and quantification in place of blood cells is uncertain.  circulating cell-free dna (cfdna) and rna (cfrna) hold enormous potential as a new class of biomarkers for the development of noninvasive liquid biopsies in many diseases and conditions.  in recent years, cfdna and cfrna have been studied intensely as tools for noninvasive prenatal testing, solid organ transplantation, cancer screening, and monitoring of tumors.  in this review, we discuss the current biochemical, clinical, and ethical challenges of cfdna testing in the prenatal setting and its future perspectives including novel applications that target rna instead of dna.  circulating cell-free dna (cfdna) testing has emerged as an alternative to tumor tissue analyses for the management of metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer (nsclc) patients.  circulating cell-free dna (ccfdna) is a valuable biomarker, but the ccfdna levels are influenced by variations that occur during sample processing.  this study attempted to take advantage of cffdna as a new material for prenatal diagnosis, which could be combined with simple quantitative fluorescent polymerase chain reaction (qf-pcr) to provide an ancillary method for the prenatal diagnosis of trisomy 21 syndrome.  we evaluated the feasibility and accuracy of non-invasive fetal gender determination using quantitative fluorescent-polymerase chain reaction (qf-pcr) analysis of circulating cffdna in the first-trimester maternal plasma.  in contrary to the risks of invasive methods that affect both mother and fetus, applying cffdna is proven to be highly effective with lower risk. ||| ",yes
Can chronological age be predicted by measuring telomere length?,"telomere length is indicative of biological age.  the measurement of telomere length might therefore assess the lifespan of a cell.  telomeric length is a reliable indicator of intrinsic biologic age and a surrogate for the mitotic clock.  there is interest in the application of telomere length measures as a biomarker of general health or ""biological age,"" and the possibility of using mean telomere length to gauge individual disease risk, and to promote lifestyle changes to improve health.  leukocyte telomere length is widely considered a biomarker of human age and in many studies indicative of health or disease.  telomere length was also positively associated with several measures of healthy aging, but this relationship was dependent on age.  the aim of this study was to set up and validate a technique enabling the assessment of telomere length on tissue sections.  telomere length has been considered in many cross-sectional studies as a biomarker of aging.  mean leukocyte telomere length may be an indicator of biological age, and as such it appears to provide information over and above chronological age of the risk for developing diseases of aging in humans.  telomere length (tl) has been proposed as a marker of mitotic cell age and as a general index of human organismic aging.  telomere shortening has emerged as an important biomarker of aging.  telomere length measurements were obtained on dna from peripheral blood samples at age 49-51 (n = 351), using a quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay.  telomeres have been advocated to be important markers of biological age in evolutionary and ecological studies.  we conclude that estimation of human age according to telomere shortening in pbls is a novel method especially when there is no morphologic information, furthermore, the gender must be considered when age estimation is carried out based on telomere shortening.  we have obtained quantitative estimates of telomere length from blood leukocytes in a population sample, confirming results of previous studies that telomere length significantly decreases with age.  our results suggest that telomere length measured very early in life (during development) and longitudinal assessments of telomere shortening during the first year of life constitute more useful biomarkers of total life expectancy than either telomere length measured after development, or telomere shortening later in adulthood.  we reveal that the rate of telomere shortening and to a lesser extent telomere length in the first year of life independently predicted lifespan, with individuals with faster shortening rates and/or shorter telomeres living less long.  here we present a method to distinguish between error and telomere elongation in longitudinal datasets, which is easy to apply and has few assumptions.  during the past few years telomere length has been measured in various human tissues.  telomere length (tl) is considered a biological marker of aging and may indicate age-related disease susceptibility. ||| ",no
Can clonidine be used to reduce agitation in children.,"clonidine produces a substantial reduction in the risk of postsevoflurane agitation in children.  on the basis of our results, clonidine might be used to safely prevent postoperative agitation in boys anaesthetised with sevoflurane.  clonidine is effective in treating sevoflurane-induced postanesthesia agitation in children.  this report provides further support of a role for clonidine in the treatment of children with adhd, particularly for those with comorbid tic disorders.  pain and discomfort scores were significantly decreased in the clonidine group; the incidence of agitation was reduced by 57% (p = 0.029) and the incidence of severe agitation by 67% (p = 0.064).  clonidine could not prevent agitation (incidence 54%, 13/24).  we conclude that clonidine is a useful adjunct for controlled hypotension in children.  30 (20%) of 150 boys in the clonidine group were agitated compared with 69 (47%) of 147 boys in the placebo group (0·43, 0·30-0·61; p<0·0001).  we aimed to assess the effects of intravenous clonidine administered intraoperatively on the incidence of postoperative agitation, pain, and adverse events.  we conducted a study on 169 children to quantify the risk reduction of clonidine agitation in patients admitted to our day-surgery pediatric clinic.  clonidine is widely used off-label in children for several indications, including pa, but the current level of evidence is limited.  to examine the efficacy of clonidine in this population of children, the use of clonidine in the treatment of children with adhd with and without comorbid tic disorders was examined in a retrospective chart review of 54 children over a 4-year period.  in the present study, we evaluated if tropisetron or clonidine could reduce the incidence of postoperative agitation after day case adenoidectomy in small children.  clonidine is used for analgesia and sedation in paediatric anaesthesia, but there are no data on its sedative properties and side effects in critically ill children.  clonidine has been suggested as an alternative pharmacotherapy for patients with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (adhd) and comorbid tic disorders.  clonidine is used increasingly in pediatric anesthesia practice to prolong the duration of action of caudal block with a local anesthetic agent.  these data suggest that oral clonidine premedication (4 micrograms/kg) is a possible approach to facilitating postoperative analgesia in children undergoing minor surgery.  clonidine may be used intraoperatively to decrease emergence delirium in children, but the drug's impact on postoperative sedation is poorly quantified.  clonidine, which is known to have analgesic and sedative properties, has recently been shown to be an effective preanesthetic medication in children.  clonidine is an effective preanesthetic medication in children, providing a preoperative sedative effect. ||| ",yes
Can cognitive behavioral therapy improve fatigue in cancer patients?,"cognitive behavior therapy has a clinically relevant effect in reducing fatigue and functional impairments in cancer survivors.  fatigue is a common symptom among cancer survivors that can be successfully treated with cognitive-behavioral therapy (cbt).  severe fatigue after cancer treatment can be treated effectively with cognitive behavioral therapy (cbt), but it is unclear whether cbt has an effect on cognitive functioning.  it was shown that cognitive behavior therapy (cbt) especially designed for postcancer fatigue is highly effective in reducing severe fatigue.  a randomised controlled trial (rct) demonstrated that cognitive behaviour therapy (cbt) for fatigue during curative cancer treatment was effective shortly after cancer treatment.  this study adapted an evidence-based clinic-delivered intervention (ebi) ""cognitive behavior therapy for post-cancer fatigue"" for use in cml patients.  the main objective of this randomized controlled trial was to show the effectiveness of cognitive behavior therapy (cbt) especially designed for fatigue in cancer survivors.  among advanced cancer patients with severe fatigue during treatment, a cbt intervention was more effective than usual care for reducing fatigue.  purpose: cancer-related fatigue is a burdensome late effect of cancer treatment.  our aim was to assess the effects of cognitive behavioral therapy (cbt) or graded exercise therapy (get) on fatigue in patients with advanced cancer during treatment with palliative intent.  the tired trial demonstrated cognitive behavior therapy's (cbt) significant and clinically relevant effects to reduce fatigue among patients with advanced cancer, while graded exercise therapy (get) did not prove beneficial.  a pilot study showed the effectiveness of cognitive-behavioral therapy (cbt) in fatigued survivors of childhood cancer (ccs).  the aim of the current analyses was to explore whether fatigue perpetuating factors (disturbed sleep/wake cycle, dysregulated activity patterns, maladaptive cognitions about fatigue and cancer, insufficient processing of cancer and treatment, inadequate social support and interactions, heightened fear of cancer progression) changed over time in patients receiving cbt-ttf, and whether the effect of cbt-ttf on fatigue was mediated by these factors.  combined cbt/get improves fatigue and functional outcomes for a subset of patients with post-cancer fatigue.  therefore, controlling fatigue is important for patients with cancer.  web-based mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (embct) has been found effective in decreasing fatigue severity in patients suffering from chronic cancer-related fatigue (ccrf).  we hypothesized that patients would report less cognitive disability after treatment with cbt for cancer-related fatigue.  patients who received cbt for post-cancer fatigue reported significantly less cognitive disability compared with those in the wl group.  cbt-ttf appears to improve tki-related fatigue in cml patients through changes in behavior (sleep, activity patterns) and cognitions about fatigue and cancer.  a total of 112 cancer survivors with somatically unexplained fatigue were allocated randomly to immediate cognitive behavior therapy or to a waiting list condition for therapy. ||| ",yes
Can desvenlafaxine be used at a dose of 50mg/day?,"fixed doses of desvenlafaxine 50 and 100 mg/day are safe, generally well tolerated, and effective at a clinically relevant level for the treatment of mdd.  taken together, these studies suggest that 50 mg is the minimum effective dose of desvenlafaxine for the treatment of major depressive disorder.  to assess the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of 50- and 100-mg/day doses of desvenlafaxine (administered as desvenlafaxine succinate), a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, for the treatment of major depressive disorder (mdd).  the objective of this study was to assess the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of desvenlafaxine (administered as desvenlafaxine succinate) 50 and 100 mg/day for major depressive disorder (mdd).  desvenlafaxine at the recommended dose of 50 mg/d was effective in relapse prevention of depression during a 6-month period in patients who demonstrated stable response after 20 weeks of open-label desvenlafaxine treatment.  desvenlafaxine 50 mg/day significantly improved depressive symptoms regardless of severity at baseline and was effective in treating both moderate and severe mdd.  these results demonstrate efficacy, safety, and tolerability of desvenlafaxine 50 mg/day for treating mdd.  this study assessed the efficacy of desvenlafaxine 50 mg/day compared with placebo for treating moderate or severe major depressive disorder (mdd).  in an effort to establish the lowest effective dose of desvenlafaxine (administered as desvenlafaxine succinate), we assessed the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of 10- and 50-mg/day desvenlafaxine vs placebo for the treatment of major depressive disorder.  desvenlafaxine 50 mg/day significantly improved depressive symptoms compared with placebo in major depressive disorder patients with clinically relevant anxiety symptoms.  to evaluate the long-term (11-month) efficacy and safety of desvenlafaxine (administered as desvenlafaxine succinate) at the recommended 50-mg/d dose in preventing relapse in patients with major depressive disorder (mdd).  safety and tolerability results were generally consistent with those in short-term studies of desvenlafaxine 50 mg/d.  outpatients with mdd received fixed-dose desvenlafaxine (50 or 100 mg/day) or placebo for 8 weeks.  both doses of desvenlafaxine were generally well tolerated.  use of rofecoxib 50 mg for >5 days is relatively common.  both desvenlafaxine doses were generally well-tolerated.  the starting dose, 50 mg/day, is the usually effective therapeutic dose, and the optimal dose when considering both efficacy and tolerability for most patients.  the 50 mg dose is recommended for acute pain only, for a maximum of 5 days.  patients with diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, fourth edition (dsm-iv) mdd and 17-item hamilton rating scale for depression (ham-d(17)) scores > or =20 were randomly assigned to double-blind placebo or desvenlafaxine treatment (fixed dose of 50 mg/day or 100 mg/day) for 8 weeks.  desvenlafaxine 50 mg was associated with a significantly greater adjusted mean change from baseline on the ham-d(17) (-11.5) compared with placebo (-9.5, p=0.018); the 100-mg dose group (-11.0) did not achieve statistical significance (p=0.065). ||| ",yes
Can doxycycline cause photosensitivity?,"one of the most important dermatologic side effects of doxycycline is photosensitivity.  doxycycline is a classically implicated cause of phototoxic reactions.  photosensitivity reactions in adult patients with em treated with doxycycline 100 mg twice daily for 10-15 days occurred rarely, were not severe, and had no long-term sequelae.  the aim of this study was to elucidate the frequency and clinical symptoms of doxycycline-induced photosensitivity in a large cohort of patients with em treated in a single medical centre.  since em predominantly occurs during summer, the potential of doxycycline to induce photosensitivity is of concern.  we present three adolescents who developed bilateral phototoxic rashes on the dorsal thenar spaces of their hands while taking doxycycline for their acne.  doxycycline (dotc) is a photosensitizing drug whose mechanism of phototoxicity is complicated by the large variety of stable photoproducts formed.  the exposure of cells to doxycycline and uva radiation resulted in concentration-dependent loss in melanocytes viability and induced melanin biosynthesis.  based on the presented unique case and the reviewed literature, only suprapharmacologic doses of doxycycline may be sufficient to cause such pigment changes.  patients prescribed doxycycline should be counseled about the potential for phototoxicity and the need for appropriate sun protection while taking the medication.  various pharmacologic agents have been linked to photosensitivity, including agents used in hematology and oncology.  the results obtained in vitro may explain the mechanisms of phototoxic reactions that occur in normal human epidermal melanocytes in vivo after exposure of skin to doxycycline and uva radiation.  as doxycycline is important for malaria prophylaxis and malaria is mainly spread in countries with high sun radiation, special attention should be paid to this adverse effect.  in studies on the efficacy of doxycycline for treating relatively small numbers of patients with em, the reported frequency of photosensitivity has varied from none to 15%.  drug-induced photosensitivity refers to the development of cutaneous adverse events due to interaction between a pharmaceutical compound and sunlight.  based on a previously reported unusual case of chronic doxycycline abuse in a psychotic patient, we have investigated the nature of the observed pigment changes in the same patient.  drug-induced photosensitivity occurs when a drug is capable of absorbing radiation from the sun (usually ultraviolet a) leading to chemical reactions that cause cellular damage (phototoxicity) or, more rarely, form photoallergens (photoallergy).  in this study, the impact of doxycycline and uva irradiation on cell viability, melanogenesis and antioxidant defense system in cultured normal human epidermal melanocytes (hemn-dp) was examined.  various drugs have been reported to cause photosensitive drug eruptions as an adverse effect.  travelers to tropical countries taking doxycycline for malaria prophylaxis need thorough medical counseling to avoid possibly severe phototoxic reactions. ||| ",yes
Can exosomes be detected in urine?,"extracellular vesicles, such as exosomes, are present in urine with reports of roles in intercellular signalling and diagnostic utility.  urinary exosomes were isolated via ultracentrifugation.  exosomes present in urine were quantified, and expression of prostate markers (psa and psma) and tumour-associated marker 5t4 was examined.  exosomes are potentially a more targeted source of material for biomarker discovery than unfractionated urine, and provide diagnostic and pathophysiological information without an invasive tissue biopsy.  exosomes are cytoplasm containing vesicles released by many cells that can be found in several biological fluids including urine.  here, we describe the discovery of urinary exosomes and address the issues on the collection, isolation, and normalization of urinary exosomes as well as delineate the systems biology approach to biomarker discovery using urinary exosomes.  urinary exosomes are an appealing source for biomarker discovery as they contain molecular constituents of their cell of origin, including proteins and genetic materials, and they can be isolated in a non-invasive manner.  recently, nanometer sized vesicles (termed exosomes) have been described as a component of urine.  urine exosomes are small vesicles exocytosed into the urine by all renal epithelial cell types under normal physiologic and disease states.  exosomes are vesicles that are released from the kidney into urine.  following the discovery of urinary exosomes in 2004, many studies have been performed using urinary exosomes as a starting material to identify biomarkers in various renal, urogenital, and systemic diseases.  increasing evidence shows that exosomal proteins in urine may be used as novel biomarkers for certain diseases.  exosomes represent an important and readily isolated subset of the urinary proteome that has the potential to shed much insight on the health status of the kidney.  the protein cargo of urine exosomes is emerging as an attractive source for biomarkers, not only for urological cancers, such as prostate, bladder and kidney cancer, but potentially also for nonurological cancers, including gastric, lung, oesophageal and colorectal cancer.  nanovesicles present in urine the so-called urinary exosomes have been found to be secreted by every epithelial cell type lining the urinary tract system in human.  exosomes are released by most cells and can be isolated from all biofluids including urine.  there are accumulating evidence that proteins carried by exosomes in urine are most possibly used as biomarkers or therapeutic carriers for certain diseases.  exosomal markers were detected in as little as 0.5 ml of urine.  our aim in this study was to investigate the feasibility and value of analysing urinary exosomes in prostate cancer patients undergoing standard therapy.  urinary nano-extracellular vesicles (nvs), including exosomes and microvesicles, are considered potential biomarkers for kidney diseases using liquid biopsies. ||| ",yes
Can ferric carboxymaltose be used to treat anemia in inflammatory bowel disease patients?,"we carried out a prospective, multicentre, observational study on the effects of ferric carboxymaltose in the treatment of iron deficiency anaemia in inflammatory bowel disease.  we performed a randomized, placebo-controlled trial to determine if administration of ferric carboxymaltose (fcm) prevents anemia in patients with ibd and low levels of serum ferritin.  anemia is a common complication of inflammatory bowel diseases (ibd) this multicenter study tested the noninferiority and safety of a new intravenous iron preparation, ferric carboxymaltose (fecarb), in comparison with oral ferrous sulfate (fesulf) in reducing iron deficiency anemia (ida) in ibd.  although intravenous ferric carboxymaltose (fcm) is effective in treating iron deficiency anemia (ida) in paediatric inflammatory bowel disease (pibd), no data are available on its post-infusion related risks.  this study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of administration of ferric carboxymaltose without erythropoiesis-stimulating agents for treating anemia in cancer patients.  to compare efficacy and safety of intravenous ferric carboxymaltose (fcm) and oral ferrous sulphate (fesulf) in patients with anaemia secondary to non-variceal gastrointestinal bleeding methods: a prospective 42-day study randomised 61 patients with haemoglobin <10 g/dl upon discharge (day 0) to receive fcm (n = 29; day 0: 1000 mg, day 7: 500 or 1000 mg; per label) or fesulf (n = 32; 325 mg/12 hours for 6 weeks).  this randomized trial evaluated ferric carboxymaltose without erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (esa) for correction of anemia in cancer patients with functional iron deficiency.  fecarb is effective and safe in ibd-associated anemia.  intravenous ferric carboxymaltose has been shown to improve symptoms and quality of life in patients with chronic heart failure and iron deficiency.  this study evaluated effectiveness and tolerability of ferric carboxymaltose (fcm) in routine treatment of anaemic cancer patients.  patients on treatment for indolent lymphoid malignancies, who had anemia  and functional iron deficiency , were randomized to ferric carboxymaltose (1,000 mg iron) or control.  ferric carboxymaltose (fcm) is a nondextran iron preparation recently approved in the united states for intravenous treatment of iron deficiency anemia (ida) in adult patients with intolerance or unsatisfactory response to oral iron or with nondialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease.  in patients with iron deficiency anemia, ferric carboxymaltose (fcm) and ferric derisomaltose (fdi) allow high-dose iron repletion.  we evaluated the efficacy and cardiovascular safety of ferric carboxymaltose (fcm), a non-dextran parenteral iron permitting large single-dose infusions, versus iron sucrose in patients with iron-deficiency anemia and ndd-ckd.  background intravenous ferric carboxymaltose (fcm) improves symptoms, functional capacity, and quality of life in heart failure and iron deficiency.  ferric carboxymaltose is a novel treatment option with a low risk of hypersensitivity reactions and well tolerated even in high doses.  in patients with iron deficiency, a left ventricular ejection fraction of less than 50%, and who were stabilised after an episode of acute heart failure, treatment with ferric carboxymaltose was safe and reduced the risk of heart failure hospitalisations, with no apparent effect on the risk of cardiovascular death.  anaemia and iron deficiency are very common in inflammatory bowel disease.  before hospital discharge, participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive intravenous ferric carboxymaltose or placebo for up to 24 weeks, dosed according to the extent of iron deficiency.  ferric carboxymaltose (fcm) is an intravenous iron formulation to correct iron deficiency. ||| ",yes
Can fetal aneuploidy be detected with non-invasive prenatal testing?,"the noninvasive prenatal test is a major advance in prenatal aneuploidy screening but it is not diagnostic and does not replace invasive testing (i.e.  the application of the dual-probe fish protocol on fetal cells isolated from maternal blood enables accurate molecular detection of fetal aneuploidy, thus providing a foundation for development of non-invasive prenatal diagnostic testing.  non-invasive prenatal testing (nipt) identifies fetal aneuploidy by sequencing cell-free dna in the maternal plasma.  noninvasive prenatal screening for fetal aneuploidy analyzes cell-free fetal dna circulating in the maternal plasma.  current non-invasive screening methods for the prenatal diagnosis of fetal aneuploidies are hampered by low sensitivities and high false positive rates.  detection of chromosomal aneuploidies using fetal cells isolated from maternal blood, for prenatal non-invasive genetic investigation, has been a long-sought goal of clinical genetics to replace amniocentesis and chorionic villous sampling to avoid any risk to the fetus.  understanding the relationship between aneuploidy detection on noninvasive prenatal testing (nipt) and occult maternal malignancies may explain results that are discordant with the fetal karyotype and improve maternal clinical care.  noninvasive prenatal test is positive for aneuploidy with a normal fetal karyotype) can occur because of biological processes such as aneuploidy confined to the placenta, a vanished twin, maternal aneuploidy or maternal cancer.  methylation-based non-invasive prenatal testing of fetal aneuploidies is an alternative method that could possibly improve fetal aneuploidy diagnosis, especially for trisomy 13(t13) and trisomy 18(t18).  the purpose of this study was to develop a sensitive and specific new assay for diagnosing aneuploidy with circulating fetal cells isolated from maternal blood as previously reported using two novel approaches: (i) simultaneous immunocytochemistry (icc) evaluation using a monoclonal antibody for i-antigen, followed by fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish); (ii) dual-probe fish analysis of interphase nuclei using two differently labeled probes, specific for different loci of chromosomes 21 and 18; in addition, short tandem repeats (str) analysis on single cells isolated by micromanipulation was applied to confirm the presence of fetal cells in the cell sample enriched from maternal blood.  objective noninvasive prenatal testing (nipt) enables the detection of common fetal aneuploidies such as trisomy 21, trisomy 18, trisomy 13, and sex chromosome abnormalities via analysis of cell-free fetal dna circulating in maternal serum.  the purpose of the study was to detect fetal aneuploidy at chromosomes 13, 18, 21, x, and y by analysis of fetal cell-free dna from maternal blood, without endangering pregnancy.  epigenetic allelic ratio analysis of maternal plasma dna represents a promising approach for noninvasive prenatal diagnosis of fetal chromosomal aneuploidies.  to assess the detection efficiency of noninvasive prenatal testing (nipt) for fetal autosomal aneuploidy, sex chromosome aneuploidy (sca), other chromosome aneuploidy, copy number variation (cnv), and to provide further data for clinical application of nipt.  current methods for noninvasive prenatal testing (nipt) ascertain fetal aneuploidies using either direct counting measures of dna fragments from specific genomic regions or relative measures of single nucleotide polymorphism frequencies.  current methods for prenatal diagnosis of chromosomal aneuploidies involve the invasive sampling of fetal materials using procedures such as amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling and constitute a finite risk to the fetus.  unlike the invasive diagnosis with high risk of miscarriage, non-invasive prenatal diagnosis (nipd) sampling from maternal blood becomes a promising way for fetal genetic screening.  compared to traditional screening using ultrasound and serum markers, the noninvasive prenatal test has superior test characteristics, including a higher detection rate and positive predictive value, and a lower false-positive rate.  using next-generation sequencing, the noninvasive prenatal test compares maternal and fetal cfdna ratios for chromosomes of interest (i.e., 21, 18, 13, x, and y) to assess chromosomal aneuploidy.  however, the use of maternal plasma fetal dna for the direct detection of fetal chromosomal aneuploidies has not been reported. ||| ",yes
Can gas vesicles be detected by ultrasound?,"gas vesicles (gvs) are a new and unique class of biologically derived ultrasound contrast agents with sub-micron size whose acoustic properties have not been fully elucidated.  gas vesicles-genetically encoded protein nanostructures isolated from buoyant photosynthetic microbes-have recently been identified as nanoscale reporters for ultrasound.  we illustrate that gas vesicles behave non-linearly when exposed to ultrasound at incident pressure ranging from 160 kpa to the collapse pressure and generate second harmonic amplitudes of -2 to -6 db below the fundamental in media with viscosities ranging from 0.89 to 8 mpa·s.  here, we demonstrate that genetic engineering of gas vesicles results in nanostructures with new mechanical, acoustic, surface, and functional properties to enable harmonic, multiplexed, and multimodal ultrasound imaging as well as cell-specific molecular targeting.  venous gas emboli (vge) can be readily detected in the bloodstream using existing ultrasound methods.  although not the primary imaging modality for this condition, ultrasound will usually demonstrate signs of free intraperitoneal or extra-luminal gas.  we conclude that ultrasonic imaging offers a useful and cost-effective alternative to doppler systems for detection and quantification of intravascular gas bubbles.  registered 21 february 2016 conclusion heading: ultrasound for determining gastric insufflation.  in our experience, it is easier to identify gas bubbles in ultrasonic images than in aural doppler signals.  furthermore, as a genetically encoded material, gas vesicles present the possibility that the nanoscale mechanical, acoustic, and targeting properties of an imaging agent can be engineered at the level of its constituent proteins.  ultrasound measurement of gastric emptying has potential advantages over scintigraphy, but there is little information about its accuracy.  gastric ultrasound is emerging as a tool that can be used to assess gastric content and volume in patients with an unknown fasting history.  we report three cases of portal venous gas detected on sonography without any portal abnormality on ct.  sonographers should be familiar with this pattern and should suspect underlying disease when gas is demonstrated in abnormal or unusual locations.  gas has a characteristic ultrasound pattern, usually recognized as an area of focal dense echogenicity with acoustic shadowing.  their unique physical properties give gas vesicles significant advantages over conventional microbubble contrast agents, including nanoscale dimensions and inherent physical stability.  ultrasonography (us) is believed to be the most available method of detecting hepatic portal venous gas (hpvg) with real-time imaging capability.  we conclude that ultrasound is a useful method to evaluate gastric emptying with good interobserver agreement.  hepatic portal venous gas has characteristic image appearances in various ultrasound modes such as bright mode, doppler mode, and even motion (m) mode.  we hypothesized that dual-frequency ultrasound (dfu) could detect these microbubbles. ||| ",yes
Can glyburide reduce cerebral edema?,"we hypothesize that treatment with rp-1127 (glyburide for injection) reduces formation of brain edema in patients after large anterior circulation infarction.  pre-clinical studies of traumatic brain injury (tbi) show that glyburide reduces edema and hemorrhagic progression of contusions.  however, treatment with iv glyburide was associated with a reduced proportion of deaths attributed to cerebral edema (n = 1  with iv glyburide vs n = 8  with placebo, p = 0.01).  preclinical models of stroke have shown that intravenous glyburide reduces brain swelling and improves survival.  several surrogate markers of vasogenic edema appear to be reduced in the setting of iv glyburide treatment in human stroke.  intravenous glyburide was well tolerated in patients with large hemispheric stroke at risk for cerebral oedema.  we assessed whether intravenous glyburide (rp-1127; glibenclamide) would safely reduce brain swelling, decrease the need for decompressive craniectomy, and improve clinical outcomes in patients presenting with a large hemispheric infarction.  glyburide is a safe, inexpensive, and efficacious alternative to dexamethasone for the treatment of cerebral metastasis-related vasogenic edema.  preclinical studies have shown that a continuous infusion of glyburide blocks edema formation and improves outcome.  this study provides class ii evidence that for patients with large hemispheric infarction, iv glyburide improves some edema-related endpoints.  glyburide is reported to prevent brain swelling in preclinical rodent models of ischemic stroke through inhibition of a non-selective channel composed of sulfonylurea receptor 1 and transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily m member 4.  inhibition of sulfonylurea receptor 1 (sur1) by glyburide has been shown to decrease edema after subarachnoid hemorrhage.  in this secondary analysis of the glyburide advantage in malignant edema and stroke (games-rp) trial, we report the effect of iv glyburide on adjudicated, edema-related endpoints.  preclinical and retrospective clinical data indicate that glyburide, a selective inhibitor of sulfonylurea receptor 1-transient receptor potential melastatin 4, is effective in preventing edema and improving outcome after focal ischemia.  iv glyburide was associated with improvements in midline shift, level of alertness, and nihss, and there were fewer deaths attributed to edema.  we report that iv glyburide was associated with t2 fluid-attenuated inversion recovery signal intensity ratio on brain mri, diminished the lesional water diffusivity between days 1 and 2 (pseudo-normalization), and reduced blood mmp-9 level.  glycerol has been used in cerebral edema for hyperosmolar dehydration of brain tissue, but only empirical relationships govern this use.  glycerol is a hyperosmolar agent that is claimed to reduce brain oedema.  to test the hypothesis that intravenous glibenclamide (glyburide; biib093) reduces ischemic brain water uptake, we quantified the lesional net water uptake (nwu) on serial ct scans from patients enrolled in the phase 2 games-rp trial (glyburide advantage in malignant edema and stroke).  in the subset of patients with malignant edema, those treated with iv glyburide had less midline shift (p < 0.01) and reduced mmp-9 (matrix metalloproteinase 9) levels (p < 0.01). ||| ",yes
Can life style changes reduce oxidative stress,"reducing excessive oxidative stress, through chronic exercise or antioxidants, can decrease the negative effects induced by excessive amounts of oxidative stress.  the reduction of oxidative stress could be achieved in three levels: by lowering exposure to environmental pollutants with oxidizing properties, by increasing levels of endogenous and exogenous antioxidants, or by lowering the generation of oxidative stress by stabilizing mitochondrial energy production and efficiency.  recent findings have evidenced that diet and physical factors are correlated to oxidative stress.  thus, this paper addresses oxidative stress and strategies to reduce it with the focus on nutritional and psychosocial interventions of oxidative stress prevention, that is, methods to stabilize mitochondria structure and energy efficiency, or approaches which would increase endogenous antioxidative protection and repair systems.  indeed, oxidative stress has been associated with many metabolic disorders due to unhealthy dietary patterns and may be alleviated by properly increasing the intake of antioxidants.  our previous studies showed the possibility that activation of the antioxidative function alleviates various oxidative damages, which are related to lifestyle diseases.  it is highly possible that adequate activation of antioxidative functions induced by low-dose irradiation can contribute to preventing or reducing oxidative damages, which are related to lifestyle diseases.  we discuss the friend-and-foe role of dietary modification (including different diet styles, calorie restriction, and nutrient supplementation) on endothelium and oxidative stress, as well as the potential benefits and concerns of physical activity and exercise on endothelium and oxidative stress.  this review focuses on the links between dietary nutrients and health, summarizing the role of oxidative stress in 'unhealthy' metabolic pathway activities in individuals and how oxidative stress is further regulated by balanced diets.  identifying factors associated with reduced oxidative stress and resulting damage may guide future disease-prevention strategies.  oxidative stress plays a key role in the aging process.  phytochemicals may reduce damage from oxidative stress; the intake of these through diet could represent a strategy to lessen their pathological consequences.  oxidative stress induced by reactive oxygen species (ros) is associated with the risk of osteoporosis, and can be reduced by certain dietary antioxidants.  on the other hand, mild oxidative stress, as in case of physical exercise, can increase the antioxidant defense system.  our study explored, in a healthy population (n = 322), the relationship between oxidative status and cardiovascular risk factors.  flight exercise appeared to increase oxidative stress.  recent evidence suggests potential benefits from phytochemicals and micronutrients in reducing the elevated oxidative and lipid-mediated stress associated with inflammation, obesity, and atherosclerosis.  thus, it is quite important to adopt a healthy dietary mode to regulate oxidative stress and maintain cell and tissue homeostasis, preventing inflammation and chronic metabolic diseases.  oxidant stress has been linked to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and incident coronary artery disease.  lifestyle behaviours including low physical activity and inadequate nutritional habits in addition to genetic susceptibility and some chronic diseases compromise physiological response to free radicals and promote oxidative damage. ||| ",yes
Can methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene mutations cause homocystinuria?,"inherited methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (mthfr) deficiency is associated with a wide spectrum of disorders including homocystinuria.  some methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (mthfr) gene mutations cause hyperhomocysteinemia and homocystinuria.  a severe deficiency of mthfr results in hyperhomocysteinaemia and homocystinuria.  deficiency in methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (mthfr), the enzyme involved in the remethylation of homocysteine to methionine using methyltetrahydrofolate as cofactor, induces hyperhomocysteinaemia, homocysteinuria, hypomethioninaemia and low methylfolate levels.  severe mthfr deficiency results in marked hyperhomocysteinemia and homocystinuria.  methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (mthfr) deficiency is an autosomal recessive disorder resulting in elevated homocysteine levels in plasma and urine.  severe mthfr deficiency results in homocystinuria and neurologic impairment.  different mthfr mutations lead either to severe homocystinuria as a multisystem disorder or to moderate hyperhomocysteinaemia, which is a common risk factor for disorders ranging from cardiovasculopathy to spina bifida.  the c677t variant of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (mthfr), a key enzyme in the remethylation of homocysteine to methionine, is a frequent genetic cause of mild hyperhomocysteinemia among individuals with low folate status.  methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (mthfr) has a key role in converting homocysteine to methionine so its deficiency might cause homocysteine accumulation and arterial destruction.  the results of our study render the full-length characterisation of affected alleles in severe homocystinuria and moderate hyperhomocysteinaemia due to mthfr deficiency and provide a basis for investigating the regulation of the human mthfr gene.  a polymorphism in methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (mthfr) is the most common genetic cause of mild hyperhomocysteinemia.  methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (mthfr) is a key enzyme in the regulation of plasma homocysteine levels.  mthfr deficiency, an autosomal recessive disorder, results in homocysteinemia.  the mthfr gene encodes the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase known to be involved in the homocysteine-methionine pathway.  methyltetrahydrofolate reductase (mthfr) is a main regulatory enzyme in homocysteine (hcy) metabolism.  mthfr deficiency, an autosomal recessive disorder, results in homocystinuria and hypomethioninaemia and presents with highly variable symptoms affecting many organs but predominantly the central nervous system.  the human 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (mthfr) represents a major enzyme in the folate-dependent regulation of methionine and homocysteine concentrations.  methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (mthfr) is important for folate and homocysteine (hcy) metabolism.  polymorphisms of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (mthfr) have been well documented to cause hyperhomocysteinemia, and recent studies suggest an association of c677t mutation of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase with low bone mineral density (bmd). ||| ",yes
Can multiple myeloma patients develop hyperviscosity syndrome?,"hyperviscosity syndrome is a rare clinical manifestation in multiple myeloma.  hyperglobulinemia of multiple myeloma (mm) plays a role in hyperviscosity syndrome (hvs).  eleven patients are described in whom myelomatosis was complicated by the laboratory and clinical features of the hyperviscosity syndrome (hvs).  cryoglobulins and hyperviscosity syndrome (hs) sometimes occur in multiple myeloma (mm), which are considered clinical emergencies.  monoclonal hypergammaglobulinemia resulting in hyperviscosity syndrome is seen in multiple myeloma and waldenström's macroglobulinemia.  the hyperviscosity syndrome is an uncommon complication in igg myeloma.  this article is a report on the first case of pure light chain myeloma associated with the hyperviscosity syndrome.  hyperviscosity syndrome can develop in patients with plasma cell dyscrasias, particularly waldenstrom macroglobulinemia (wm).  these results indicate that the concentration and molecular configuration of the myeloma protein are important determinants of the presence or absence of the hyperviscosity syndrome.  multiple myeloma (mm) is an immedicable malignancy of the human plasma cells producing abnormal antibodies (also referred to as paraproteins) leading to kidney problems and hyperviscosity syndrome.  occurring in 10%-30% of patients with hyperviscosity syndrome, wm is an uncommon b-cell proliferative disorder characterized by bone marrow infiltration and production of monoclonal immunoglobulin m. the elevated blood viscosity in wm is the result of increased circulating serum immunoglobulin m. because hyperviscosity syndrome can be lethal, it must be recognized and managed early.  the hyperviscosity syndrome refers to a group of symptoms and signs related to increased blood viscosity often produced by monoclonal immunoglobulins.  other hematologic and metabolic abnormalities seen in patients with plasma cell dyscrasias also contribute to hyperviscosity.  we have recently seen a patient with known acquired immunodeficiency syndrome who presented with the hyperviscosity syndrome in the setting of polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia.  it can cause a hyperviscosity syndrome secondary to the paraproteinaemia associated with the disease.  symptomatic hyperviscosity is an oncologic emergency which is suspected when patients with certain hematogical malignancies present with neurological symptoms.  multiple myeloma is a neoplastic plasma-cell disorder resulting from malignant plasma cells in the bone marrow.  multiple myeloma is a malignant disorder characterized by bone marrow proliferation of plasma cells and by overproduction of monoclonal immunoglobulin detectable in the sera (m-spike).  hyperviscosity syndrome (hvs) can cause multiple organ damage if not treated immediately.  symptomatic hyperviscosity is much more common in waldenström's macroglobulinemia (10 to 30%) than it is in myeloma (2 to 6%). ||| ",yes
Can mutations in Calmodulin cause ventricular fibrillation?,"a number of calmodulin (cam) mutations cause severe cardiac arrhythmias, but their arrhythmogenic mechanisms are unclear.  mutations in the calmodulin protein (cam) are associated with arrhythmia syndromes.  calmodulinopathies are life-threatening arrhythmia syndromes that arise from mutations in calmodulin (cam), a calcium sensing protein whose sequence is completely conserved across all vertebrates.  calmodulin (cam) mutations are associated with an autosomal dominant syndrome of ventricular arrhythmia and sudden death that can present with divergent clinical features of catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (cpvt) or long qt syndrome (lqts).  mutations in the genes encoding the highly conserved ca2+-sensing protein calmodulin (cam) cause severe cardiac arrhythmias, including catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia or long qt syndrome and sudden cardiac death.  calmodulinopathies comprise a new category of potentially life-threatening genetic arrhythmia syndromes capable of producing severe long-qt syndrome (lqts) with mutations involving calm1, calm2, or calm3.  calmodulin (cam) mutations are associated with congenital long qt (lqt) syndrome (lqts), which may be related to the dysregulation of the cardiac-predominant ca2+ channel isoform cav1.2.  the intracellular ca(2+) sensor calmodulin (cam) regulates the cardiac ca(2+) release channel/ryanodine receptor 2 (ryr2), and mutations in cam cause arrhythmias such as catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (cpvt) and long qt syndrome.  however, a conundrum has existed because mutations in one such contractile protein, a so-called ca2+ sensor troponin t (tnt), can promote ventricular rhythm disturbances even in the absence of hypertrophy or fibrosis.  ryr2 is regulated by calmodulin (cam), and mutations that disrupt their interaction can cause aberrant calcium release, leading to an arrhythmia.  mutations in contractile proteins in heart muscle can cause anatomical changes that result in cardiac arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death.  mutations in the calcium-binding protein calsequestrin cause the highly lethal familial arrhythmia catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (cpvt).  mutations of two myocardial calcium signaling molecules, ryanodine receptor 2 (ryr2) and calsequestrin 2 (casq2), may cause catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (cpvt), a severe inherited arrhythmic disease manifesting with salvoes of exercise-induced bidirectional and polymorphic tachycardias.  a novel cam mutation (cam(f90l)) was recently identified in a family with idiopathic ventricular fibrillation (ivf) and early onset sudden cardiac death.  human mutations in the ca2+ sensor calmodulin (cam) have been associated with cpvt susceptibility, suggesting that cam dysfunction is a key driver of the disease.  excessive activation of calmodulin kinase ii (camkii) causes arrhythmias and heart failure, but the cellular mechanisms for camkii-targeted proteins causing disordered cell membrane excitability and myocardial dysfunction remain uncertain.  calmodulin (cam) associates with cardiac ryanodine receptor type-2 (ryr2) as an important regulator.  these mutations have been shown to interfere with the function of cardiac ion channels, including the voltage-gated ca2+ channel cav 1.2 and the ryanodine receptor (ryr2), in a mutation-specific manner.  calmodulin (cam) association with the cardiac muscle ryanodine receptor (ryr2) regulates excitation-contraction coupling.  catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (cpvt) is a familial arrhythmic syndrome caused by mutations in genes encoding the calcium-regulation proteins cardiac ryanodine receptor (ryr2) or calsequestrin-2 (casq2). ||| ",yes
Can nanoparticles be used for afterglow imaging?,"afterglow nanoparticles have been widely investigated as new agents for cancer imaging and as a light source for photodynamic activation for cancer treatment.  the applications of afterglow particles for photodynamic activation and biological imaging have become a topical research area.  water-soluble red afterglow imaging agents based on ecofriendly nanomaterials have potential application in time-gated afterglow bioimaging due to their larger penetration depth and nondurable excitation.  afterglow-magnetic nanoparticles (nps) offer enormous potential for bioimaging applications, as they can be manipulated by a magnetic field, as well as emitting light after irradiation with an excitation source, thus distinguishing themselves from fluorescent living cells.  however, afterglow imaging has been limited by its reliance on inorganic nanoparticles with relatively low brightness and short-near-infrared (nir) emission.  time-gated in vivo afterglow imaging has been demonstrated by using the cnds-rhb@silica as afterglow agents.  nanoparticles are a new class of imaging agent used for both anatomic and molecular imaging.  afterglow optical agents, which emit light long after cessation of excitation, hold promise for ultrasensitive in vivo imaging because they eliminate tissue autofluorescence.  for both applications, the targeting of the afterglow nanoparticles to tumor cells is an important and challenging issue.  nanoparticles are widely used as contrast and therapeutic agents.  nanoparticles are attracting considerable interest as contrast agents for many different imaging modalities.  afterglow luminescent probes with high signal-to-background ratio show promise for in vivo imaging; however, such probes that can be selectively delivered into target sites and switch on afterglow luminescence remain limited.  herein, red afterglow imaging agents consisted of rhodamine b (rhb) and carbon nanodots (cnds) have been designed and demonstrated.  the ability to quantitatively and non-invasively image nanoparticles has important implications for the development of nanoparticles as in vivo cancer diagnostic and therapeutic agents.  all these results indicate the methods reported here for afterglow nanoparticle synthesis, coating and conjugation are successful, and consequently, the prepared sr2mgsi2o7:eu2+, dy3+/ppix/folic acid nano-conjugates are promising for x-ray induced photodynamic therapy on cancer treatment.  these results indicated that it is feasible to use solid nanoparticles as contrast enhancing agents for ultrasonic imaging.  owing to their unique afterglow ability, long-wavelength light activatable persistent luminescence (persl) nanoparticles (plnps) have been emerging as an important category of imaging probes.  nanoparticles have drawn great attention as targeted imaging and/or therapeutic agents.  persistent luminescence nanoparticles (plnps) with rechargeable near-infrared afterglow properties attract much attention for tumor diagnosis in living animals since they can avoid tissue autofluorescence and greatly improve the signal-to-background ratio.  as for r11-sh peptide, cellular uptake of the afterglow nanoparticles was observed on lncap and pc3 prostate cancer cell lines. ||| ",yes
Can non ubiquitinated Tomm20 promote mitophagy?,"tomm20 expression directly impacted the mitochondrial function including atp production and maintenance of membrane potential, which contributed to tumorigenic cellular activities including regulation of s phase cell cycle and apoptosis.  tomm20 is a subunit of the outer mitochondrial membrane translocase that plays a major role as a receptor of precursor proteins with n-terminal cleavable presequences targeted to the mitochondria.  tomm20 was shown to be overexpressed in various cancers.  this is the first report demonstrating a relationship between tomm20 and tumorigenesis in colorectal cancer and providing promising evidence for the potential for tomm20 to serve as a new therapeutic target of colorectal cancer.  in sum, our results contribute to a better understanding of the role of ndp52 in mitophagy and underline, for the first time, a possible role of ndp52 in ms.  translocase of outer mitochondrial membrane 20 (tomm20) plays an essential role as a receptor for proteins targeted to mitochondria.  the purpose of this study was to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanism of tomm20's contribution to tumorigenesis and to explore the possibility of its therapeutic potential using colorectal cancer as a model.  notably, knockdown of tomm20 in the xenograft mouse model resulted in a significant reduction of tumor growth.  tom20 is an outer mitochondrial membrane protein that functions as a component of the import receptor complex for cytoplasmically synthesized mitochondrial precursor proteins.  tom20 is an outer mitochondrial membrane protein and functions as a component of the import receptor complex for the cytoplasmically synthesized mitochondrial precursor proteins.  here we have qualitatively and quantitatively studied the main players in pink1-mediated mitophagy in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs) of patients with relapsing-remitting ms. we found the variant c.491g>a (rs550510, p.g140e) of ndp52, one of the major mitophagy receptor genes, associated with a ms cohort.  we analyzed the mitochondria-targeting signal of rat tom20 (rtom20) in cos-7 cells, using green fluorescent protein (gfp) as the reporter by systematically introducing deletions or mutations into the tmd or the flanking regions.  tom20 is a major receptor of the mitochondrial preprotein translocation system and is bound to the outer membrane through the nh(2)-terminal transmembrane domain (tmd) in an nin-ccyt orientation.  tom20 is part of a multiple component, dynamic complex that functions to import specific cytosolic proteins into or through the outer membrane of the mitochondrion.  tom20 is a subunit of the tom complex and binds to the n-terminal region (ie, presequence) in mitochondrial matrix precursor proteins.  precise targeting of mitochondrial precursor proteins to mitochondria requires receptor functions of tom20, tom22, and tom70 on the mitochondrial surface.  tom20 and tom34 are mammalian liver proteins previously identified by others to be components of the mitochondrial import translocation apparatus.  the process of import and assembly of the protein is known to be dependent on the surface receptor tom20, but the requirement for other mitochondrial proteins remains controversial.  therefore tom20 has a dual role in protein import into mitochondria: recognition of the targeting signal in the presequence and tethering the presequence to the tom40 complex to increase import efficiency.  jnk2-deficient mice displayed defective mitophagy, which resulted in tissue damage under hypoxic stress, as well as hyperactivation of inflammasomes and increased mortality in sepsis. ||| ",no
Can protein coding exons originate from ALU sequences?,"we investigated the creation and establishment of alu exons in human genes, using transcriptome profiles of human tissues generated by high-throughput rna sequencing (rna-seq) combined with extensive rt-pcr analysis.  thousands of human genes contain spliced exons derived from alu elements.  using rna sequencing, ribosome profiling, and proteomics data from human tissues and cell lines, we provide evidence for the translational activities of alu exons and the presence of alu exon derived peptides in human proteins.  more than 25% of alu exons analyzed by rna-seq have estimated transcript inclusion levels of at least 50% in the human cerebellum, indicating widespread establishment of alu exons in human genes.  we detected numerous further differences between alu exons and their non-exonizing counterparts, among others in terms of exon-intron architecture and strength of splicing signals, enhancers, and silencers.  moreover, the computationally derived probabilities of exonization significantly correlated with the biological inclusion level of the alu exons, and the model could also be extended to general datasets of constitutive and alternative exons.  alu elements are major contributors to lineage-specific new exons in primate and human genomes.  recent studies indicate that some alu exons have high transcript inclusion levels or tissue-specific splicing profiles, and may play important regulatory roles in modulating mrna degradation or translational efficiency.  the alu element has been a major source of new exons during primate evolution.  moreover, the preferential creation and establishment of alu exons in zinc finger genes suggest that alu exonization may have globally affected the evolution of primate and human transcriptomes by regulating the protein production of master transcriptional regulators in specific lineages.  to understand the molecular basis and the regulation of the process of turning intronic alus into new exons, we compiled and analyzed a data set of human exonized alus.  however, identifying alu exons that have acquired genuine biological functions remains a major challenge.  we adopt a proteotranscriptomics approach to systematically assess the contribution of alu exons to the human proteome.  the prevailing view is that exons derived from young repetitive elements, such as alu elements, are restricted to regulatory functions and have not had adequate evolutionary time to be incorporated into stable, functional proteins.  our data indicate that alu elements have contributed to the acquisition of novel protein sequences during primate and human evolution.  we identified and characterized numerous features used by the splicing machinery to discriminate between alu exons and their non-exonizing counterparts.  in the case of the rna editing enzyme adarb1, which contains an alu exon peptide in its catalytic domain, rna sequencing analyses of a-to-i editing demonstrate that both the alu exon skipping and inclusion isoforms encode active enzymes.  these alu exon peptides represent species-specific protein differences between primates and other mammals, and in certain instances between humans and closely related primates.  in this study, we analyzed alu exonization events, aiming to understand the requirements for correct selection of exons.  on the basis of these findings, we identified mutations that activated the exonization of a silent intronic alu. ||| ",yes
Can radius fracture cause carpal tunnel syndrome?,"the purpose of this study was to assess the relationship between carpal tunnel syndrome and concomitant degenerative osteoarthritis of the wrist or basal thumb joint.  carpal tunnel syndrome disrupts kinematics of the thumb during opposition and circumduction despite normal pinch strength.  acute carpal tunnel syndrome, which is much less common, is more often directly related to fractures and fracture-dislocations about the wrist, hemorrhagic conditions, and vascular disorders involving the wrist.  loss of median nerve function or a neuropathic pain syndrome may occur in around 20% of distal radius fractures if post-traumatic oedema in the carpal canal generates excessive pressure on the median nerve.  except for scaphotrapeziotrapezoid location, degenerative osteoarthritis of the wrist was significantly linked with carpal tunnel syndrome, whereas there was no significant difference between case and control groups for prevalence of basal osteoarthritis of the thumb.  carpal tunnel syndrome is a neuropathy resulting from compression of the median nerve as it passes through a narrow tunnel in the wrist on its way to the hand.  although carpal tunnel syndrome associated with injury to the wrist is common, it is possible to overlook symptoms of median nerve compression caused by an ascending tenosynovitis secondary to trauma distal to the wrist.  the unusual presence of the radial artery within the carpal tunnel could be a contributing factor to the development of carpal tunnel syndrome.  motion deficits were observed for patients with carpal tunnel syndrome even though maximum pinch strength was similar.  carpal tunnel syndrome is the most common nerve compression disorder of the upper extremity, and it is traditionally considered a peripheral neuropathy associated with a localized compression of the median nerve just at the level of the carpal tunnel.  the objective of this review is to compare the efficacy of surgical treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome with non-surgical treatment in improving clinical outcome.  in contrast, degenerative osteoarthritis of the wrist was strongly associated with carpal tunnel syndrome, suggesting a causal relation.  carpal tunnel syndrome (cts) is the most common entrapment neuropathy occurring in upper limbs.  a rare case of carpal tunnel syndrome due to solitary osteochondroma arising from the metaphysis of the distal radius is presented.  the purpose of this work is to see if changes in the elasticity of the transverse carpal ligament may cause carpal tunnel syndrome.  carpal tunnel syndrome is usually caused by compression of the median nerve due to synovial swelling, tumor, or anomalous anatomical structure within the carpal tunnel.  these results suggest that basal osteoarthritis of the thumb is not a causal factor in carpal tunnel syndrome.  carpal tunnel syndrome is associated with sensory and motor impairments resulting from the compressed and malfunctioning median nerve.  the thumb is critical to hand function, yet the pathokinematics of the thumb associated with carpal tunnel syndrome are not well understood.  carpal tunnel syndrome results from entrapment of the median nerve in the wrist. ||| ",yes
Can siRNA affect response to afatinib treatment?,"small interfering rnas (sirnas) can synergistically enhance the cell killing effects of drugs used in cancer treatment.  this article provides further evidence of sirna-induced off-target effects generating a measurable phenotype and also provides an example of how such undesirable phenotypes can be mitigated by addition of chemical modifications to the sirna.  despite all the potential of sirna as a novel class of drugs, the limited cellular uptake, low biological stability, and unfavorable pharmacokinetics of sirnas have limited their application in the clinic.  cell cycle arrest in both cell lines occurred at lower levels after sirna + doxorubicin treatment compared to doxorubicin only.  rnai might constitute a novel therapeutic approach for cancer treatment because researchers can easily design sirna molecules to inhibit, specifically and potently, the expression of any protein involved in tumor initiation and progression.  we determine the sirna-induced changes in kinetic rates and their correlations between target and reference protein expression.  the application of sirnas for both functional analysis of genes and medication raises several questions.  here we show that a fraction of randomly selected small inhibitory rnas (sirnas) can induce changes in cell viability in a target-independent fashion.  in practice, a number of factors influence whether an sirna sequence will elicit rnai and knockdown target gene expression.  sirna targeting halr and anti-halr mcab significantly inhibited the growth of xenograft tumor in 5 nude mice.  since it relies on small interfering rnas (sirnas), which are the mediators of rnai-induced specific mrna degradation, a major issue is the delivery of therapeutically active sirnas into the target tissue/target cells in vivo.  the anti-tumoral effects of pei/sirna-based targeting of tumor-relevant genes in vivo are described.  the adenoviral vector expressing small interfering rna (sirna) is highly effective in mammalian cells.  small-interfering rnas (sirnas) can be used to knockdown gene expression of specific mrnas.  we applied the adenovirus-delivered sirna (adsirna) to inhibit a hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc) oncogene, p28gank, in hcc cell lines and investigated its antitumor effects.  this review highlights the recent knowledge on the guidelines for the selection of sirnas which show high activity in the absence of non-specific sirna effects.  the effector molecules-small interfering rnas (sirnas) and micrornas (mirnas)-can be used to silence or ""switch off"" specific cancer genes.  the sirna targeting halr and anti-halr mcab inhibited obviously the growth of hepg2 cells in vitro.  in addition, pegylation impairs the internalization of the sirna into the target cell and its subsequent escape from the endocytic pathway, which reduces biological activity.  self-structure in either the sirna sequence or the target mrna at the binding site may prevent gene silencing. ||| ",yes
Can sorafenib activate AMPK?,"these data suggest that the combination of sorafenib with ampk activators could have beneficial effects on tumor regression by ampk pathway activation.  here, we identify sorafenib as an activator of amp-activated protein kinase (ampk), in a manner that involves either upstream lkb1 or camkk2.  the combination of metformin or other ampk activators and sorafenib could be tested in prospective clinical trials.  sorafenib-inhibited raf-dependent signaling in crc cells, however, either did not affect the expression of akt or increased it.  a synergistic effect of both drugs is also seen on phosphorylation of the ampkα activation site.  furthermore, sorafenib pretreatment led to decreased phosphorylation levels of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (erk) and protein kinase b (akt) in smmc-7721 cells.  however, pi3k/akt signaling pathway is activated by sorafenib and cross-talks with the raf/mapk/erk signaling pathway, leading to drug resistance.  previous studies have shown sorafenib to function as a multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor in different tumors.  it is unknown whether ""paradoxical"" erk activation occurs after sorafenib therapy in hcc, and if so, if it impacts the therapeutic efficacy.  this study explored whether the efficacy of sorafenib can be improved by adding the mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (erk) kinase (mek) inhibitor ci-1040 to vertically block the raf/mek/erk pathway.  this study examined the sorafenib resistance mechanism.  sorafenib increased upa secretion, which was abrogated by an akt inhibitor.  in this study, we investigated whether sorafenib exerts an enhanced anticancer effect on crc cells via the calcium-mediated deactivation of the focal adhesion kinase (fak) signaling pathways.  patients were enrolled at escalating doses of sorafenib.  here, the effects of sorafenib on neuroinflammatory responses in vitro and in vivo and the underlying mechanisms were assessed.  sorafenib blocks signaling and synergizes with rapamycin in vivo, preventing tumor progression.  sorafenib is fda-approved for the treatment of primary kidney or liver cancer, but its ability to inhibit many types of kinases suggests it may have potential for treating other diseases.  sorafenib is a multi-target small molecule inhibitor of the raf kinase family and vegfr-2/pdgfr.  sorafenib induced the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways.  because most anticancer drugs act, at least in part, through the generation of reactive oxygen species, we investigated whether sorafenib can induce an oxidative stress. ||| ",yes
Can telomere length shortening be reversed by telomerase?,"on the other hand, the reverse transcriptase telomerase can add back telomeric repeats at the telomere ends.  these results prove that critically short telomeres can be rescued by telomerase, and become fully functional, thus rescuing premature aging.  the most common method of restoring telomere length is via telomerase reverse transcriptase activity, highly expressed during embryogenesis.  reconstitution of telomerase activity is proposed as a potential gene therapy to prevent, or rescue, age-related diseases produced by critical telomere shortening.  shortening of telomeres along with an up-regulation of telomerase is implicated in the immortality of tumor cells.  telomerase is a cellular reverse transcriptase that extends one strand (the g-strand) of the telomere terminal repeats.  telomerase is a ribonucleoprotein that counteracts telomere shortening and can immortalise human cells.  telomerase is a reverse transcriptase enzyme contributing to the maintenance of the telomeric structure by adding telomere repeat sequences to chromosomal ends, thus compensating for its shortening.  here, we review recent findings that illuminate our understanding of telomerase.  telomerase counteracts this terminal sequence loss by synthesizing telomeric repeats through repeated cycles of reverse transcription of its internal rna template.  when telomeres become sufficiently short, senescence is induced.  telomere shortening controls the entry of cells into senescence.  telomerase, a cellular reverse transcriptase, adds telomeric repeats to chromosome ends.  in this study, published measurements of telomere distributions in human fibroblasts and human endothelial cells were used to show that telomeres shorten in a length-dependent fashion.  while inhibiting telomerase provides a novel approach to the treatment of many cancers, telomere maintenance can occur in the absence of telomerase activity by the alternative lengthening of telomeres (alt) mechanism.  telomerase, via its catalytic component telomerase reverse transcriptase (tert), extends telomeres of eukaryotic chromosomes.  telomerase activity compensates shortening of telomeres during cell division and enables cancer cells to escape senescent processes.  we addressed this by re-introducing telomerase in late generation telomerase-deficient mice, terc-/-, which have short telomeres and show severe proliferative defects.  telomerase is an rna-dependent dna polymerase that compensates for the telomere shortening that occurs in its absence.  evidence is accumulating that telomere shortening and subsequent senescence might play a crucial role in life-threatening diseases. ||| ",yes
Can tetracycline affect tooth formation?,"tetracycline may cause tooth discoloration when used in young children during tooth development.  this case report suggests the possibility that discoloration from tetracycline may not be limited to tooth development in the child, but may also affect the adult dentition.  possible mechanisms of how tetracycline may cause extrinsic tooth discoloration are discussed.  administration of tetracycline to children or pregnant women is known to adversely affect the color of developing teeth.  the findings indicate that the incorporation of tetracycline into enamel and dentin is caused by physiochemical processes that may take place regardless of the developmental stage of the mineralized tissues.  the present investigation examines the in vitro reaction between tetracycline chloride and enamel and dentin of extracted human teeth.  the purpose of the investigation was to evaluate enamel formation in maxillary incisors of rats given a single low dose of a tetracycline with low toxicity, commonly used in research.  tetracycline has significant cytotoxicity on periodontal cells.  the results of the present study indicate that the distribution pattern of tetracycline in the developing dental hard tissues is greatly affected by the pathologic changes induced by phosphonoformic acid and hebp.  the administration of tetracycline to the growing child may cause discoloration and hypoplasia in developing teeth.  both drugs caused similar changes in the pattern of tetracycline uptake in the developing enamel.  the tetracycline solutions, which were all very acidic, were found to cause 1) demineralization of enamel and dentin, 2) incorporation of fluorescent material in enamel and, notably, dentin; and 3) formation of yellow, rhombohedral crystals on dental surfaces, especially in the more concentrated solutions.  furthermore, tetracyclines react with dental hard tissues to from long-lasting antimicrobial compounds, and they have a retarding effect on pellicle and plaque formation and an antienzymatic effect.  there seems to be a direct relation between the presence of developmental defects of enamel and the degree of discoloration induced by tetracycline.  tetracycline, a broad-spectrum antibiotic, is known to cause intrinsic discoloration of the dentition.  it is possible that chronic sun exposure of the incorporated tetracycline may cause the formation of a reddish-purple oxidation product, resulting in discoloration of the permanent teeth.  incorporation of tetracyline into dental enamels was studied by exposing presoftened enamel slabs to tetracycline-containing mineralizing solutions.  tetracycline staining of teeth during tooth development is well documented.  this study was designed to test the effect of tetracycline on healing subsequent to periodontal surgery.  in view of the belief that tetracycline is removed from bone when it is demineralized, it was decided to investigate the effect of demineralizing agents on human dentine. ||| ",yes
Can the CEP290 gene mutations be targeted by AAV-mediated gene therapy?,"here we report the development of lentiviral vectors carrying full-length cep290 for the purpose of correcting the cep290 disease-specific phenotype in human cells.  autosomal recessive cep290-associated lca is a good candidate for gene replacement therapy, and cells derived from affected individuals give researchers the ability to study human disease and therapeutic gene correction in vitro.  the successful construction and viral transfer of full-length cep290 brings us closer to the goal of providing gene- and cell-based therapies for patients affected with this common form of lca.  genome editing through adeno-associated viral (aav) vectors is a promising gene therapy strategy for various diseases, especially genetic disorders.  a lentiviral vector containing cmv-driven human full-length cep290 was constructed.  during the past decades, several studies have demonstrated the potential of aav-based gene therapies for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.  mutations in cep290 are the most common cause of leber congenital amaurosis (lca), a severe inherited retinal degenerative disease for which there is currently no cure.  however, current research indicates that the genetic modification of aav vectors may further facilitate the success of aav gene therapy.  importantly, lentiviral delivery of cep290 rescued the ciliogenesis defect.  transfer of genes by adeno-associated virus (aav) vectors is benefiting patients with particular genetic defects.  we evaluated retinal gene therapy with an adeno-associated virus vector that used to deliver a functional version of the chm gene (aav2-rep1).  adeno-associated virus (aav) vector-mediated gene delivery was recently approved for the treatment of inherited blindness and spinal muscular atrophy, and long-term therapeutic effects have been achieved for other rare diseases, including haemophilia and duchenne muscular dystrophy.  to investigate the expression of human erythropoietin (hepo) in 293 cell line using adeno-associated virus (aav) vector, and provide information for its potential application in human gene therapy.  a related approach uses aav vectors to edit specific regions of the dmd gene using crispr/cas9.  this study demonstrates a novel strategy to dramatically increase aav transduction which substantially enhanced in vivo genome editing efficiency in adult animal models, showing clinical potential for both conventional and genome editing-based gene therapy.  the most promising approaches use gene transfer vectors derived from adeno-associated virus (aav) to supplement a gene function in the affected cell type.  despite the popularity of adeno-associated virus 2 (aav2) as a vehicle for gene transfer, its efficacy for liver-directed gene therapy in hemophilia a or b has been suboptimal.  to overcome this issue, we developed a single aav platform that allows local replacement of a mutated sequence with its wildtype counterpart, based on combined crispr-cas9 and micro-homology-mediated end-joining (mmej).  supplementing wildtype copies of functionally defective genes with adeno-associated virus (aav) is a strategy being explored clinically for various retinal dystrophies.  this review will cover the benefits of aav as a promising gene vector by itself, the progress and advantages of engineered aav vectors, particularly synthetically engineered ones, and the current state of their clinical translation in therapy. ||| ",no
Can the Micro-C XL method achieve mononucleosome resolution?,"we present micro-c xl, an improved method for analysis of chromosome folding at mononucleosome resolution.  micro-c xl provides a single assay to interrogate chromosome folding at length scales from the nucleosome to the full genome.  elucidating chromatin structure in vitro requires resolution below 10 nm to visualize the mononucleosome has been an ongoing challenge.  in addition, micro-c provides a detailed map of nucleosome positions and localizes contact domain boundaries with nucleosomal precision.  using long crosslinkers and isolation of insoluble chromatin, micro-c xl increases signal-to-noise ratio.  micrococcal nuclease (mnase) digestion of chromatin cuts linker dna between neighboring nucleosomes and in this way generates mononucleosomes.  to overcome the limited resolution of prior studies, we extend a recently developed hi-c variant, micro-c, to map chromosome architecture at nucleosome resolution in human escs and fibroblasts.  digestion of chromatin with micrococcal nuclease (mnase) is widely used to probe nucleosome organization.  the aim of this study was to investigate the capability of using a conventional flow cytometer for the detection and sorting at high purity microchromosomes with an estimated size of 2.7 mb.  micrococcal-nuclease digestion of rat liver nuclei selectively released mononucleosomes associated with adp-ribosylated  it is a rapid and robust technology useful for the analysis of chromatin properties genome-wide at the resolution of mono-nucleosomes.  two classes of mononucleosome were detected, those that leaked out during digestion and those that were subsequently released by 5mm-sodium phosphate buffer (ph6.8)/0.2mm-naedta.  improved resolution of the peak of microchromosomes in a bivariate plot of hoechst versus chromomycin fluorescence was obtainable after discriminating clumps and debris based on gating data within a fsc versus pulse width plot.  micro-c robustly captures known features of chromosome folding including compartment organization, topologically associating domains, and interactions between ctcf binding sites.  the analysis and isolation of high numbers of chromosomes smaller than 3 mb in size (microchromosomes) with good purity is dependent primarily on the detection sensitivity of the flow cytometer and the precision of the sort unit.  mnase-seq is a genome-wide procedure that allows mapping of dna associated to nucleosomes following micrococcal nuclease digestion.  the method based on uv-microspectrophotometric measurement of alkali digested chromosome samples before and after gel filtration through sephadex microcolumns permits the simultaneous estimation of dna as well as rna amount of single chromosomes and nucleoli.  here, we describe how to produce high-resolution nucleosome maps of cells grown in suspension or adherent mammalian cells.  thermal-denaturation properties of control and phosphorylated mononucleosomes and core particles were very similar; removal of histone h1 and non-histone chromosomal proteins in 0.5m-nacl markedly increased the proportion of dna ;melting' below 70 degrees c.  single nucleotide extension was performed in a new instrument, the lightscanner 32 (ls32), which uses capillary reaction tubes and is capable of real-time pcr and sequential high-resolution melting of 32 samples. ||| ",yes
Can the apoptosis regulator BAX trigger the release of cytochrome c?,"therefore, bax/p18 has a cytochrome c-releasing activity that promotes cell death independent of bcl-2.  we now report that bax is sufficient to trigger the release of cytochrome c from isolated mitochondria.  upon apoptosis induction, the proapoptotic protein bax is translocated from the cytosol to mitochondria, where it promotes release of cytochrome c, a caspase-activating protein.  the pro-apoptotic bcl-2 homologues bax and bak are activated following the induction of apoptosis and induce cytochrome c release from mitochondria.  however, the molecular mechanisms by which bax triggers cytochrome c release are unknown.  these results demonstrated that bax translocation is critical for cyanide-induced cytochrome c release and that p38 map kinase regulates bax translocation from cytosol to mitochondria.  during mitochondrial apoptosis, pro-apoptotic bh3-only proteins cause the translocation of cytosolic bcl-2-associated x protein (bax) to the outer mitochondrial membrane (omm) where it is activated to release cytochrome c from the mitochondrial intermembrane space, but the mechanism is under dispute.  the mechanism by which the proapoptotic protein bax releases cytochrome c from mitochondria is not fully understood.  cytochrome c release is thought to play an important role in the initiation of apoptosis.  temporal analysis showed that bax translocation preceded cytochrome c release from the mitochondria, which was initiated 3 h after cyanide treatment.  here, we show that on isolated mitochondria, bax causes the release of cytochrome c, but not of aif, and the association of aif with the mitochondrial inner membrane provides a simple explanation for its lack of release upon bax-mediated outer membrane permeabilization.  cleavage of bax was followed by release of mitochondrial cytochrome c, activation of caspase-3, cleavage of poly(adp-ribose) polymerase, and fragmentation of dna.  our results support the concept that the release of cytochrome c into the cytoplasm can promote the apoptotic process in cells expressing pro-caspase 3 but that cytochrome c release is not sufficient to induce death in all cells.  (1) baxdeltac selectively releases cytochrome c and enables a bidirectional movement of cytochrome c across the outer mitochondrial membrane.  in contrast, transfection of a cloned bax/p18 cdna into multiple human cancer cell lines targeted bax/p18 to mitochondria, which was accompanied by release of cytochrome c and induction of caspase-3-mediated apoptosis that was not blocked by overexpression of bcl-2 protein.  recent reports have demonstrated that cytochrome c is released from mitochondria during apoptosis and have suggested that this release may be a critical step in the activation of proapoptotic caspases and subsequent cell death.  our results suggest that the mitochondrial calpain plays an essential role in apoptotic commitment by cleaving bax and generating the bax/p18 fragment, which in turn mediates cytochrome c release and initiates the apoptotic execution.  we conclude that cytochrome c can be a prime initiator of apoptosis in intact growing cells and acts downstream of bcl-2 and mitochondria, but that other cells are resistant to its apoptogenic activity.  activation of the pro-apoptotic bax protein, a bcl-2 family member, is known to trigger apoptosis by forming pores in the mitochondrial outer membrane (mom).  the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria and apoptosis relies on several preferential and selective interactions involving the bcl-2 family of proteins. ||| ",yes
Can the iPS cell technology be used in Fanconi anemia therapy?,"induced pluripotent stem cells (ipscs) represent an invaluable tool in a chromosomal instability syndrome such as fanconi anemia (fa), as they can allow to study of the molecular defects underlying this disease.  patient-specific ips cells have been derived not only for disease modeling but also as sources for cell replacement therapy.  generation of fanconi anemia (fa) patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells (ipscs) has been reported to be technically challenging due to the defects in the fa-pathway in the patients' somatic cells.  we focused on the use of ipscs for cell-based therapy of haemophilia.  although the safety of ipsc derivation has not been completely validated, anucleate cells, such as platelets or erythrocytes, derived from ipscs are promising targets.  induced pluripotent stem (ips) cells may be of use in regenerative medicine.  although cell therapy using ipsc-derived cells still has many hurdles to overcome before clinical applications, disease analysis using patient-specific ipscs may be of practical use in the near future.  fanconi anemia (fa) is a rare inherited genomic instability syndrome representing one of the best examples of hematopoietic stem cell deficiency.  but the greatest impact of ipscs may be in bone marrow failure diseases, as ipscs could represent an unlimited source of autologous cells to apply in advanced treatments such as gene therapy.  the technology to develop endoderm-derived human ips cell lines, together with other established cell lines, will provide a foundation for elucidating the mechanisms of cellular reprogramming and for studying the safety and efficacy of differentially originated human ips cells for cell therapy.  coupled with the biotechnologies of cell therapy or tissue engineering, ipsc technology will enormously contribute to human regenerative medicine.  induced pluripotent stem cells (ipscs) are a promising tool for regenerative medicine.  induced pluripotent stem cells (ipscs) can be generated from patients with specific diseases by the transduction of reprogramming factors and can be useful as a cell source for cell transplantation therapy for various diseases with impaired organs.  our data suggest that ipscs could be an attractive and prospective autologous cell source for the production of coagulation factor, and that engineered ipscs expressing coagulation factor might provide a cell-based therapeutic strategy appropriate for haemophilia.  since the first publications describing the generation of ipscs from human tissue in 2007, a phase i/iia clinical trial testing an autologous ipsc-derived cell therapy has been initiated in the u.s., and several other autologous ipsc-based therapies have advanced through various stages of development.  induced pluripotent stem cell (ipsc) technology offers a practically infinite and ethically acceptable source to obtain a variety of somatic cells.  for the study of liver disease pathogenesis, this technology also provides a potentially more amenable system for generating liver disease-specific ips cells.  the breakthrough of induced pluripotent stem cell (ipsc) technology has raised the possibility that patient-specific ipscs may become a renewable source of autologous cells for cell therapy without the concern of immune rejection.  the discovery of ipscs has led to the ex vivo production of differentiated cells for regenerative medicine.  ultimately, genetic correction, molecular characterization and successful engraftment of ipsc-derived cells may provide an attractive alternative to current hematopoietic stem cell-targeted gene therapy in some monogenic diseases, including fa. ||| ",yes
Can the yeast protein Abf1 act as insulator?,"abf1 is a multifunctional protein present in saccharomyces cerevisiae, involved in transcription-activation and -repression as well as in dna-replication.  abfi also binds sequences located in promoter regions of some yeast genes, including ded1, an essential gene of unknown function that is transcribed constitutively at a high level.  abfi (ars-binding protein i) is a yeast protein that binds specific dna sequences associated with several autonomously replicating sequences (arss).  in this report we describe studies which utilized yeast strains bearing gain and loss of function alleles of abf1 in order to attempt to directly implicate abf1p in modulating transcription of the tbp-encoding gene, spt15, in vivo.  kiabf1 can substitute abf1 in s. cerevisiae, emphasizing the conservation of the multiple functions of this protein.  further, in a yeast strain expressing a temperature sensitive form of abf1p, occupancy of the chromosomal abf1 site in the tbp-encoding gene was immediately lost following a temperature shift.  in order to identify conserved functional domains in abf1, we have cloned and sequenced the gene encoding the abf1-homologue from k. lactis.  the autonomously replicating sequence binding factor 1 (abf1) was initially identified as an essential dna replication factor and later shown to be a component of the regulatory network controlling mitotic and meiotic cell cycle progression in budding yeast.  the ded1 t-rich element acted synergistically with all other abfi-binding sites and with binding sites for other multifunctional yeast activators.  we found that overexpression of abf1p in a yeast cell increased transcription of the tbp-encoding gene and that this stimulation depended upon the exact sequence of the abf1p binding site (abf1) present in the gene.  we report the cloning and sequence analysis of the yeast baf1 gene which encodes an abundant protein previously shown to act as a transcription activator in the ypt1-tub2 intergene region.  we describe in this study how yeast cdc6 protein stimulates abf1 protein dna binding activities.  the involvement of the abfi transcription factor in organizing the chromatin structure of the saccharomyces cerevisiae ars1 region has been previously postulated.  further genetic analysis identified the yeast transcription factor adr1 as a high copy suppressor of e1a function.  several lines of evidence indicate the occurrence in the related species kluyveromyces lactis of a protein having similar properties to those of abf1 in s. cerevisiae.  we have cloned and sequenced an abp1 homologous gene of saccharomyces exiguus, a yeast which is only distantly related to s. cerevisiae.  in budding yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae, an ars binding factor 1 (abf1) binds to the sequence-specific dna element involved in dna replication and transcription.  here, we report a comprehensive approach aiming at the identification of direct abf1-target genes expressed during fermentation, respiration, and sporulation.  this work identified 434 protein-coding loci as being transcriptionally dependent on abf1.  we propose a model to explain these results and suggest mechanisms by which abf1p could activate gene transcription. ||| ",yes
Can valproic acid act as an activator of AMPK?,"valproic acid is frequently prescribed and used to treat epilepsy, bipolar disorder and other conditions.  valproic (2-propylpentanoic) acid is a commonly used drug in the treatment of bipolar disorder and epilepsy.  valproic acid (vpa) is a widely prescribed anticonvulsant for the treatment of epilepsy.  valproic acid, an established antiepileptic and antimanic drug, has recently emerged as a promising emotion-stabilizing agent for patients with psychosis.  the hypothesis whether valproic acid (vpa) and its main microsomal metabolite, delta(4)-valproic acid, can be activated to the respective coa esters in the cell cytosol was investigated.  valproic acid exhibits a time course of antiepileptic effects suggesting a major role for active metabolites.  however, the mechanism of action of valproic acid has not been fully elucidated.  valproic acid is widely used to treat epilepsy and bipolar disorder and is also a potent teratogen, but its mechanisms of action in any of these settings are unknown.  valproate (valproic acid, vpa) is widely used in the therapy of epilepsy.  valproic acid is an anticonvulsant, which is also widely used for treating psychiatric disorders.  there are some reports that treatment with valproic acid may increase brain serotonergic neurotransmission in the rodent.  valproic acid has a long-standing reputation of effectively treating the symptoms of not only epilepsy but also psychiatric conditions.  epileptic activity in prefrontal cortex pyramidal neurons was potently inhibited by two therapeutic concentrations of valproic acid (20 μm and 200 μm).  valproyl coa could contribute to valproate's antiepileptic activity by stimulating na+, k+-atpase activity when brain atp concentration is low.  valproic acid (vlp) is a widely used anticonvulsant and mood-stabilizing drug that relieves the endoplasmic reticulum (er) stress response, a pathogenetic process related to diabetes.  these studies are the first to establish vpa and its metabolites as in vitro activators of ampk.  valproic acid, like trichostatin a, also activates transcription from diverse exogenous and endogenous promoters.  valproic acid (vpa), widely used as mood stablizer, has been shown therapeutic effects in controlling both episodes of mania and depression.  in line with this, treatment of hepatocytes with metabolites of vpa resulted in increased phosphorylation of ampk/acc as compared with vpa.  valproic acid inhibited the maximal amplitude and did not change the activation parameters of ttx-resistant sodium currents. ||| ",yes
Can valproic acid prolong survival of glioblastoma patients?,"retrospective evidence suggests that valproic acid (vpa), an antiepileptic drug, is associated with improved outcomes in glioblastoma.  valproic acid (vpa) has been recently investigated for its anticancer properties in different tumors, including malignant gliomas.  valproic acid (vpa) is an antiepileptic agent with histone deacetylase inhibitor activity shown to enhance overall survival and progression free survival in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma (gbm).  valproic acid (vpa) is a histone deacetylase inhibitor that apart from its anticonvulsive effects in some retrospective studies has been suggested to lead to a superior outcome of glioblastoma patients.  several uncontrolled retrospective case series and a post hoc analysis of the registration trial for temozolomide indicated an association between valproic acid (vpa) use and improved survival outcomes in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma.  valproic acid (vpa), a widely used antiepileptic drug, has been found to have antitumor effects on gliomas, but its role still has not been determined.  several clinical studies have reported that valproic acid could prolong survival of gbm patients.  valproic acid (va) is an antiepileptic drug (aed) and histone deacetylase (hdac) inhibitor taken by patients with glioblastoma (gb) to manage seizures, and it can modulate the biologic effects of radiation therapy (rt).  to examine the efficacy of valproic acid (vpa) given either with or without levetiracetam (lev) on seizure control and on survival in patients with glioblastoma multiforme (gbm) treated with chemoradiation.  valproic acid (vpa), an anticonvulsant and mood-stabilizing drug is used to treat epileptic seizure of glioblastoma patients.  literature data support evidences that glioblastoma (gbm) patients experience prolonged survival due to sodium valproate (navp) treatment.  valproic acid (vpa), one of the most common histone deacetylase inhibitors (hdacis), has been detected to directly or synergistically exert inhibitory effects on glioma in vitro and in vivo.  valproic acid (vpa), a histone deacetylase (hdac) inhibitor, is also used to manage seizures in glioblastoma patients.  in addition to its anticonvulsant and mood stabilizing properties, valproic acid can also inhibit the growth of cancer cells.  we have reported that valproic acid upregulates melatonin mt1 receptor expression in rat c6 glioma cells.  valproic acid, a histone deacetylase inhibitor, has beneficial effects in the setting of cancer, neurologic diseases, and traumatic injuries.  the results of our study suggest that glioblastoma patients may experience prolonged survival due to vpa administration.  our results suggest that chronic treatment with valproate may protect neuronal cells from damage caused by oxidative stress and that neuroprotection from oxidative damages may be involved in the mechanism of action of valproate.  prolonged treatment with adjuvant valganciclovir has been shown in one retrospective study to exert a significant effect on overall survival (os) in newly diagnosed patients with glioblastoma multiforme (gbm).  the purpose of this study was to determine if valproate provides a neuroprotective effect against damage caused by oxidative stress in primary cultured rat cerebral cortical cells. ||| ",yes
Can venlafaxine block NET and SERT?,"venlafaxine blocks both serotonin and norepinephrine transporters (sert and net), with higher affinity for sert.  chronic venlafaxine treatment affected sert and net binding differently from paroxetine or desipramine.  the inability of venlafaxine to reduce sert or net binding sites is not due to its dual uptake inhibiting properties.  neither dose of venlafaxine nor amitriptyline reduced binding to either the sert or net.  both medications produced dose-dependent inhibition of the sert and net.  venlafaxine inhibits the reuptake of serotonin, norepinephrine, and, to a lesser extent, dopamine.  venlafaxine is an antidepressant agent which blocks in vitro the reuptake of both 5-ht and na.  venlafaxine, an antidepressant belongs to serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (snri), blocks the synaptic reuptake of serotonin in lower doses and also blocks reuptake of norepinephrine in higher doses.  paroxetine and venlafaxine are potent serotonin transporter (sert) antagonists and weaker norepinephrine transporter (net) antagonists.  platelet 5-ht uptake was inhibited by venlafaxine across the dose range and by sertraline but not maprotiline.  indirect evidence suggests that the antidepressant venlafaxine hydrochloride selectively inhibits serotonin (5-ht) uptake at low doses, whereas at high doses, it inhibits both 5-ht and norepinephrine (ne) uptake.  this study sheds light on the biological mechanisms underlying the effects of venlafaxine.  these results show that, similarly to desipramine 100 mg, venlafaxine 150 mg can potentiate venoconstrictor responses to noradrenaline, consistent with venlafaxine's ability to block noradrenaline uptake in man.  unlike typical selective serontonin reuptake inhibitors (ssris), venlafaxine may have modulatory effects on nerve terminals and neuronal plasticity.  venlafaxine inhibited binding to the human ne and 5-ht transporters with k(i) values of 2480 and 82 nm, respectively, and with a k(i) ratio of 30.  we hypothesized that venlafaxine would affect monoamine transporters dose-dependently, with low doses causing selective reduction of sert binding sites and higher doses reducing both sert and net binding sites.  in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study the effects of venlafaxine--a novel nontricyclic compound inhibiting neuronal uptake of serotonin, noradrenaline and to a lesser extent dopamine--were investigated utilizing eeg brain mapping, psychometric and psychophysiological measures.  venlafaxine (ven) and its metabolite o-desmethylvenlafaxine (odv) inhibit reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine.  the results clearly demonstrate that paroxetine and venlafaxine are potent sert antagonists and less potent net antagonists in vivo.  maximal net inhibition for paroxetine and venlafaxine at week 8 was 36% (sd 19) and 60% (sd 13), respectively. ||| ",yes
Can vitamin B1 deficiency cause encephalopathy?,"vitamin b12 deficiency also leads to brain shrinkage and neurodegenerative disorders.  vitamin b12 deficiency leads to abnormal myelination or demyelination, resulting in sub-acute combined degeneration, peripheral neuropathy, and psychiatric problems, including delusions, hallucinations, cognitive changes, depression, and dementia.  neurologic complications associated with vitamin b12 deficiency include spinal cord degeneration, peripheral neuropathy and alteration of mental status.  vitamin b12 deficiency causes a number of neurological features including cognitive and psychiatric disturbances, gait instability, neuropathy, and autonomic dysfunction.  wernicke's encephalopathy (we) is a severe neurological disorder caused by a dietary deficiency of vitamin b1 and characterized by consciousness changes, ocular abnormalities, and ataxia.  in this study, it was determined that there was microstructural damage in the brain in the presence of vitamin b12 deficiency even in the asymptomatic period, and the patients revealed cognitive decline.  the purpose of this study was to show the cognitive effects in vitamin b12 deficiency cases that have not reached clinical symptom level using neuropsychological tests, and to show possible cerebral neuronal damage using diffusion tensor imaging (dti) method.  alteration of vitamin b12 metabolism can be genetic or acquired, and can result in anemia, failure to thrive, developmental regression and even irreversible neurologic damage.  wernicke encephalopathy--a debilitating acute or subacute neurological disorder-is caused by a deficiency in thiamine (vitamin b(1)).  can vitamin b12 and folate deficiency cause central retinal vein occlusion?  vitamin b12 deficiency is a common condition which can present with non-specific clinical features, and in severe cases with neurological or haematological abnormalities.  in developing countries, nutritional vitamin b12 deficiency in infants because of maternal deficiency often causes hematological and neurological disorders.  vitamin b12 deficiency leads to various symptoms such as neuropathy, growth retardation, and infertility.  low vitamin b₁₂ concentrations have been associated with higher risks of cognitive impairment, but whether these associations are causal is uncertain.  the biological basis for the observed neurological symptoms of infantile vitamin b12 deficiency remains uncertain.  optic neuropathy is a rare but recognised complication of vitamin b12 deficiency, which may proceed to visual failure if not diagnosed early enough.  vitamin b(12) deficiency (b(12)d) has a wide variety of neurological symptoms and signs.  vitamin b12 (cobalamin) deficiency is a common cause of macrocytic anemia and has been implicated in a spectrum of neuropsychiatric disorders.  however, epilepsy is a rare manifestation of vitamin b12 deficiency.  the possibility of vitamin b12 deficiency must be considered in all patients with these nervous system disorders, even in those who do not have anemia. ||| ",yes
"Can we detect DNA strand asymmetries using dinucleotide relative abundance ""genomic signatures""?","dinucleotide relative abundances are considered an idiosyncratic feature of genomes, regarded as a 'genomic signature'.  motivated by this finding, we introduce the 'generalized genomic signatures' (ggss), composed of over- and under-abundances of all oligonucleotides of a given length, thus filtering out compositional trends and neighbour preferences at any shorter range.  the compositional asymmetry of complementary bases in nucleotide sequences implies the existence of a mutational or selectional bias in the two strands of the dna duplex, which is commonly shaped by strand-specific mechanisms in transcription or replication.  the use of measures of compositional strand bias in order to quantify the degree of strand asymmetry is crucial, as it is the basis for determining the applicability of compositional analysis and comparing the strength of the mutational bias in different biological machineries in various species.  here, we review the measures of strand bias that have been proposed to date, including the ∆gc skew, the b(1) index, the predictability score of linear discriminant analysis for gene orientation, the signal-to-noise ratio of the oligonucleotide bias, and the gc skew index.  curvature of the dna molecule occurs in dna regions with a specific type of nucleotide sequence periodicities.  in this paper we describe a simple approach using double peaks in chromatograms generated as artefacts in the vicinity of heterozygous indels, to identify the specific sequences present in individual strands of a given dna fragment.  the finding was supported by dna curvature and was prevalent in all core dna sequences.  we believe that this simple, low-cost and practical method could be useful towards identifying and detecting dna in biotechnology and pathology.  sensitive methods for the quantification of dna fragments can be used to study an individual's genetic constitution for duplicated regions of the genome or to determine the relative proportion of different dna fragments in heterogeneous samples such as pooled dna from different individuals or in samples in which a fraction of the chromosomes carry a mutation.  these results demonstrate the potential for utilizing simple surface modifications and existing biochemical moieties in individual nucleobases for a reliable, direct, single-molecule, nanoelectronic dna and rna nucleotide identification method for sequencing.  while many studies display a large ensemble of measurements as ""electronic fingerprints"" with some promise for distinguishing the dna and rna nucleobases (adenine, guanine, cytosine, thymine, and uracil), important metrics such as accuracy and confidence of base calling fall well below the current genomic methods.  by analyzing dinucleotide position-frequency data of yeast nucleosome-bound dna sequences, dinucleotide periodicities of core dna sequences were investigated.  it is possible to utilize these characteristic properties to identify/detect dna.  we describe a solution-based fluorescence method that discriminates between wild-type and mutant sequences using a dsdna binding dye, and interrogates a region of >200 nucleotides.  we describe two-dimensional strandness-dependent electrophoresis (2d-sde) for quantification and length distribution analysis of single-stranded (ss) dna fragments, double-stranded (ds) dna fragments, rna-dna hybrids, and nicked dna fragments in complex samples.  we utilize nper as a method to achieve >99.7% accuracy for dna and rna base calling at low molecular coverage (∼12×) using unbiased single measurements on dna/rna nucleotides, which represents a significant advance compared to existing sequencing methods.  dideoxy fingerprinting (ddf) is a hybrid technique which combines aspects of single strand conformational polymorphism (sscp) and dideoxy sequencing to detect the presence of single base changes in a defined fragment of nucleic acid.  for reasons not entirely understood, such dinucleotide repeats in genomic sequences have been associated with genomic instability leading to cancer.  dna molecules differing by as little as a single-base substitution have traditionally been distinguished by gel electrophoresis-based methodologies that exploit differences in the sequence-specific properties of double-stranded dna (dsdna) such as melting temperature and secondary conformational configuration. ||| ",no
Can we use platelet biomarkers to study Alzheimer's disease?,"this study highlights the utility of lc-ms/ms to quantify human platelet membrane proteins and suggests that platelets may serve as a source of blood-based biomarkers in neurodegenerative disease.  taken together, our data provide a set of platelet biomarkers for predicting cognitive decline which may be applied for the early screening of ad.  platelet proteins have been studied as ad biomarkers with relative success.  the discovery that intact alzheimer amyloid precursor protein is present in platelet granules, has created a great interest in the biochemistry, physiology and function of platelets of patients with alzheimer disease (ad).  biomarkers of alzheimer's disease may be useful, not only for early diagnosis of the disease, but also for monitoring the progress of drug trials.  blood platelets may be of particular interest in search of biomarkers, because they express amyloid-precursor protein (app), and display a dysfunctional processing in ad.  the aim of the present study is to establish and validate an assay for secreted amyloid-precursor protein (sapp)-α and -β in platelets of ad and mild cognitively impaired (mci) subjects, compared to healthy young and old controls.  our data reveal that quantitive analysis of platelet sapp-β assay by elisa may be a novel diagnostic biomarker for mci and ad.  to evaluate the ratio of platelet app forms (appr) in early-stage ad and mild cognitive impairment (mci) and its potential as a biomarker for the early identification of ad.  blood platelets frequently serve as peripheral model for studying ad pathogenesis and might represent a reasonable biomarker source.  blood-based biomarkers for alzheimer's disease (ad) might facilitate identification of participants for clinical trials targeting amyloid beta (abeta) accumulation, and aid in ad diagnostics.  previous findings demonstrated an altered pattern of amyloid-β protein precursor (aβpp) expression in platelets of alzheimer's disease (ad) patients compared with either healthy control subjects or patients with non-alzheimer-type dementia.  in the present study, we investigate whether alterations of caspase family and bcl2 family could be found in the platelets in alzheimer's disease (ad) and amnestic mild cognitive impairment (mci) patients.  as platelets share similarities to neuron biology, it may serve as a peripheral matrix for biomarkers of neurological disorders.  despite the inability of these particular monoclonal antibodies to recognize native forms of aβpp, identification of a new aβpp isoform in platelets as a potential ad biomarker can provide an additional tool for the development of a reliable diagnostic test to detect preclinical stages of ad.  an altered platelet ratio of amyloid precursor protein (app) isoforms might be a diagnostic, predictive, or therapeutic marker for alzheimer's disease (ad).  patients affected by sporadic alzheimer disease (ad) show a significant alteration of amyloid precursor protein (app) forms in platelets when compared with patients with dementia but without ad and age-matched controls.  we report a comparative analysis of the membrane-enriched platelet proteome between patients with mild to moderate ad and cognitively normal, healthy subjects.  after subjects were grouped according to diagnosis and severity of dementia, app isoform levels in platelets were compared.  given parallels between neuron and platelet biology, we hypothesized platelet membrane-associated protein changes may differentiate patients clinically defined with probable ad from noncognitive impaired controls. ||| ",yes
Can zinc finger nucleases be used to combat disease?,"zinc-finger nucleases (zfns) are promising new tools for enhancing the efficiency of gene targeting in many organisms.  zinc finger nucleases (zfns), consisting of an engineered zinc finger array fused to a non-specific cleavage domain, have been extensively used to modify a broad range of endogenous genes.  in particular, zinc-finger nucleases (zfns), which consist of a nonspecific endonuclease domain tethered to a tailored zinc-finger (zf) dna-binding domain, have proven invaluable for stimulating homology-directed gene repair in a variety of cell types.  zinc-finger nucleases (zfns) are targetable dna cleavage reagents that have been adopted as gene-targeting tools.  zinc finger nucleases (zfns) have been used to direct precise modifications of the genetic information in living cells at high efficiency.  zinc-finger nucleases (zfns) are designer nucleases capable of cleaving a prespecified target dna within complex genomes.  zinc-finger nickases (zfnickases) are a type of programmable nuclease that can be engineered from zinc-finger nucleases to induce site-specific single-strand breaks or nicks in genomic dna, which result in homology-directed repair.  zinc finger nucleases (zfns) are man-made restriction enzymes useful for manipulating genomes by cleaving target dna sequences.  customized zinc finger nucleases (zfns) form the basis of a broadly applicable tool for highly efficient genome modification.  engineered nucleases such as zinc finger nucleases (zfn) and transcription activator-like effector nucleases (talen) are one of the most promising tools for modifying genomes.  custom-designed zinc finger nucleases (zfns) are becoming powerful tools in gene targeting-the process of replacing a gene within a genome by homologous recombination.  zinc finger nucleases (zfns) are designed restriction enzymes consisting of a nonspecific cleavage domain fused to sequence-specific dna binding domains.  although zinc-finger nuclease-mediated gene disruption has been demonstrated in pigs and cattle, they have not been used to target gene addition into an endogenous gene locus in any large domestic species.  custom-designed zinc finger nucleases (zfns), proteins designed to cut at specific dna sequences, are becoming powerful tools in gene targeting--the process of replacing a gene within a genome by homologous recombination (hr).  engineered zinc-finger nucleases (zfns) are promising tools for genome manipulation, and determining off-target cleavage sites of these enzymes is of great interest.  the first truly targetable reagents were the zinc finger nucleases (zfns) showing that arbitrary dna sequences could be addressed for cleavage by protein engineering, ushering in the breakthrough in genome manipulation.  zfns are artificial restriction endonucleases consisting of a non-specific nuclease domain fused to a zinc finger array which can be engineered to recognize specific dna sequences of interest.  here, we demonstrate a method for ligand-mediated delivery of zinc finger nucleases (zfn) proteins using transferrin receptor-mediated endocytosis.  artificial nuclease-dependent dna cleavage systems (zinc-finger nuclease, zfn; transcription activator like effectors, talens) and exogenous nucleic acid defense systems (crispr/cas) have been used in the new era for genome modification.  an important consideration in the design of zfns is the number of zinc fingers that are required for efficient and specific cleavage. ||| ",yes
Could Arimidex (anastrozole) cause hot flashes?,"arimidex (anastrozole) is a potent aromatase inhibitor capable to induce an in-vivo milieu deprived of estradiol.  anastrozole (arimidex, 2,-2bis(2-met hyl)propiononitrile) is a novel, potent aromatase inhibitor belonging to the triazole class.  the arimidex (anastrozole), tamoxifen, alone or in combination (atac) trial was designed to compare the efficacy and safety of anastrozole with tamoxifen as adjuvant treatment for postmenopausal women with early-stage breast cancer.  objective: the hot flash is a common vasomotor disorder that causes distress in menopausal women and that can be debilitating in men with prostate cancer who are treated with androgen deprivation therapy (adt).  data from the 'arimidex', tamoxifen, alone or in combination (atac) trial have indicated that anastrozole ('arimidex') may supplant tamoxifen as the preferred adjuvant endocrine therapy for hormone receptor-positive, early breast cancer in postmenopausal women.  results from two studies, the north american trial and the tamoxifen or arimidex randomized group efficacy and tolerability (target) trial carried out in europe/rest of the world comparing 'arimidex' (anastrozole) 1 mg with tamoxifen 20 mg for treatment of advanced breast cancer in postmenopausal women, have previously been reported individually and as a prospectively combined analysis.  arimidex is a potent and selective aromatase inhibitor undergoing evaluation as a treatment for postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer.  in the 'arimidex', tamoxifen alone or in combination (atac) trial, the aromatase inhibitor (ai) anastrozole had a significantly better efficacy and safety profile than tamoxifen as initial adjuvant therapy for hormone receptor-positive (hr+) early breast cancer (ebc) in postmenopausal patients.  a 68-year-old woman was prescribed anastrozole after surgical removal of her breast cancer and adjuvant radiation therapy.  the arimidex, tamoxifen, alone or in combination (atac) trial (median follow-up, 68 months) has shown that adjuvant anastrozole has superior efficacy and better tolerability than tamoxifen.  anastrozole, a selective nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor is widely used as an adjuvant therapy for postmenopausal women with early hormone-sensitive breast cancer.  anastrozole, a nonsteroidal selective aromatase inhibitor, has recently been approved in the us and several other countries for the adjuvant treatment of postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive early breast cancer.  compared with tamoxifen, anastrozole was associated with a significantly lower incidence of vaginal bleeding, vaginal discharge, hot flushes, endometrial cancer, ischaemic cerebrovascular events, venous thromboembolic events and deep vein thrombosis including pulmonary embolism; tamoxifen was associated with a lower incidence of musculoskeletal disorders and fracture.  however, anastrozole reduces circulating estrogen, and low estradiol levels are associated with decreased bone mineral density (bmd) and increased fracture risk.  in the arimidex, tamoxifen alone or in combination (atac) trial, anastrazole 1mg was significantly more effective than tamoxifen 20mg or combined treatment (17 and 19% relative risk reduction) for disease-free survival in postmenopausal women with early breast cancer.  doses of 1 to 10 mg of arimidex suppressed estradiol to the maximum degree measurable.  at median follow-up of 68 months (range 1-93), treatment-related adverse events occurred significantly less often with anastrozole than with tamoxifen (1884  vs 2117 ; p<0.0001), as did treatment-related serious adverse events (146  vs 277 ; p<0.0001) and adverse events leading to withdrawal (344  vs 442 ; p=0.0002).  patients given anastrozole had significantly fewer overall events for the global index of the women's health initiative (744  vs 851 ; hazard ratio 0.85 , p=0.001) and the global index of disease-free survival and serious adverse events (1453  vs 1594 ; 0.88 ; p=0.0004).  anastrozole is associated with accelerated bone loss over the 5-year treatment period.  arimidex had no clinically significant effects on key enzymes that regulate cortisol and aldosterone biosynthesis. ||| ",yes
Could BRCA gene test used for breast and ovarian cancer risk?,"recent identification of the breast-ovarian cancer susceptibility gene brca1 and the breast cancer susceptibility gene brca2 have raised the possibility of clinical genetic testing for breast cancer susceptibility.  genetic testing enables women at risk for hereditary breast and/or ovarian cancer to find out whether they have inherited the gene mutation (brca1/brca2), and if so, to opt for frequent surveillance and/or prophylactic surgery (bilateral mastectomy and/or oophorectomy).  in women at increased risk for breast and ovarian cancer, the identification of a mutation in breast cancer gene 1 (brca1) and brca2 has important implications for screening and prevention counseling.  germline mutations in brca genes are associated with breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility.  main objective of our study was to determine the effectiveness of ovarian cancer screening in women with a brca1/2 mutation.  the discovery of brca1 and brca2 has led to a reassessment of the association between family history of breast/ovarian cancer and breast cancer risk after controlling for carrier status for mutations in the brca1 and brca2 genes.  we evaluated 241 consecutive women with a brca1 or brca2 mutation who were enrolled in the surveillance program for hereditary ovarian cancer from september 1995 until may 2006 at the university medical center groningen (umcg), the netherlands.  genetic mutations in breast cancer susceptibility genes brca1/2 are associated with an increased risk of breast/ovarian cancers.  brca mutation screening is frequently offered on the basis of the fulfillment of empirical selection criteria, thought to be indicative of a genetic predisposition to breast/ovarian cancer (brca/ovca).  brca1 and brca2 are genes that cause breast and ovarian cancer when they are inherited in families.  brca1 and brca2 testing is integral to cancer risk assessment in all high-risk women.  the recommendation to pursue brca1/2 testing is based on patient's family history of breast/ovarian cancer, age of disease-onset and/or pathologic parameters of breast tumors.  women with a germline pathogenic variant in the breast cancer susceptibility genes (brca1 or brca2) have an increased risk of early-onset breast and ovarian cancer.  the most important known risk factor for ovarian cancer is the brca1-2 mutation, which is clinically often manifested through a positive family history of cancer of the breast and/or ovary.  brca1/2 gene mutations increase risk of breast and/or ovarian cancer and may have implications for reproductive health.  patients with breast cancer who have mutations in the high penetrance genes brca1 and brca2, have an increased risk of ovarian cancer.  we aimed to identify the effects of the reproductive histories of women with the brca1/2 mutations on the clinical presentation of breast cancer.  five hundred and twenty-three breast cancer patients including 237 diagnosed ≤ 30 years of age and 286 with a family history of breast/ovarian cancer were screened for brca1/2 small-range mutations and large genomic rearrangements.  women harboring brca1/2 germline mutations have high lifetime risk of developing breast/ovarian cancer.  possession of a brca1/2 mutation increases risk of contralateral breast and ovarian cancer recurrence and may have an impact on health management decisions, such as imaging screening, preventive surgical interventions and systemic therapies. ||| ",yes

Could DNA (cytosine-5-)-methyltransferases serve as tumour markers?,"analysis of methylated dna, which refers to 5-methycytosine (5mc) versus cytosine (c) at specific loci in genomic dna (gdna), has received increased attention in epigenomics, particularly in the area of cancer biomarkers.  in this study, we tested cervical tissues at various stages of tumor progression for 5-methylcytosine and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine levels and also dna promoter methylation profile of a panel of genes for its diagnostic potential.  background: dna methylation is an important epigenetic modification, among which 5-methylcytosine methylation (5mc) is generally associated with tumorigenesis.  dna methylation (5-methylcytosine (5mc)) patterns are often altered in cancers.  alteration of dna methylation (5-methylcytosine, 5mc) patterns represents one of the causes of tumorigenesis and cancer progression.  5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmc) is converted from dna methylation of cytosine (5mc) by the catalysis of tet proteins, and proposed to be involved in tumorigenesis.  the development of new tools for tracking the activity of human dna methyltransferases is an important goal given the role of this enzyme as a cancer biomarker and epigenetic modulator.  as prevalent markers on dna, 5-methylcytosine (5mc), n6-methyladenine (6ma), and n4-methylcytosine (4mc) can be recognized by specific methyltransferases, facilitating cellular defense and the versatile regulation of gene expression in eukaryotes and prokaryotes.  the 5-methylcytosine and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine contents were significantly reduced in squamous cell carcinoma and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed a significant difference in (1) 5-methylcytosine between normal and squamous cell carcinoma tissues (area under the curve = 0.946) and (2) 5-hydroxymethylcytosine levels among normal, squamous intraepithelial lesions and squamous cell carcinoma.  recent studies have suggested that 5-methyl-2'-deoxycytidine (5medc) may be a marker of hypermethylation of dna.  thus, reduction of 5hmc content represents an epigenetic hallmark of human tumours, and according to our recent report, 5cac is enriched in a proportion of breast cancers and gliomas.  dna methylation (5-methylcytosine, 5mc) is involved in regulation of a wide range of biological processes.  we have used a highly quantitative 5' nuclease fluorogenic reverse transcription-pcr method (taqman) to analyze the expression of all three dna methyltransferase genes in 25 individual colorectal adenocarcinoma specimens and matched normal mucosa samples.  to investigate the association between methylation and expression at o6-methylguanine-dna methyltransferase, we performed methylation-specific pcr and immunohistochemistry in 149 gastric carcinomas.  aberrant dna methylation patterns are found in cancer cells.  the global and gene-specific methylation of the panel of genes identified in our study may serve as useful biomarkers for the early detection and clinical management of cervical cancer.  dna methylation entails the covalent addition of a methyl group to c-5 position of cytosine by a family of dna methyltransferase enzymes and has a significant role in gene regulation.  the correlation between the 5mc modification and tumor microenvironment cell infiltration was further assessed.  to examine correlation between the o6-methylguanine-dna methyltransferase expression and the clinical data, we investigated o6-methylguanine-dna methyltransferase expression in 315 consecutive gastric carcinomas.  dna cytosine 5-methyltransferase (dnmt) catalyzes methylation at the c5 position of the cytosine residues in the cpg sequence. ||| ",yes
Could Hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) be effective for the treatment of recurrent ovarian cancer?,"hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (hipec) has been proposed as a treatment in ovarian cancer.  hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (hipec) has shown promise in treatment of ovarian carcinosis.  intraperitoneal intraoperative hyperthermic chemotherapy (hipec) has been used in the treatment of ovarian cancer.  hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (hipec), a strategy combining maximal cytoreductive surgery and maximal regional chemotherapy, has been applied to treat ovarian cancer resulting in long-term survival rates in selected patients.  hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (hipec) may improve the outcome of patients with initially unresectable ovarian cancer who are eligible for complete cytoreductive surgery (ccrs) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy.  hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (hipec), along with optimal cytoreductive surgery, has been debated to be a viable option for the treatment of advanced epithelial ovarian cancer with peritoneal carcinomatosis.  hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (hipec) is often used to treat gastrointestinal malignancies and is of interest in epithelial ovarian cancer (eoc) given the propensity for intraperitoneal spread.  although the standard of care after recurrence of epithelial ovarian cancer (eoc) is chemotherapy, increasing data suggest that combining cytoreductive surgery with intraoperative hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (hipec) is a promising option for patients with recurrent eoc.  hypertherm intraperitoneal chemotherapy (hipec) is increasingly used in the treatment of ovarian, tubal, and primary peritoneal cancer (oc).  we conducted a trial to investigate whether the addition of hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (hipec) to interval cytoreductive surgery would improve outcomes among patients who were receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy for stage iii epithelial ovarian cancer.  the feasibility and safety of oxaliplatin-based hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (hipec) associated with cytoreductive surgery (crs) was assessed in patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis resulting from primary advanced or relapsing epithelial ovarian cancer (eoc).  hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (hipec) and complete surgical removal of the tumor, in relapsing patients may provide a clinical benefit.  in this review we discuss treatment with hipec in patients with ovarian cancer and future prospective of its use in clinical setting.  hipec had been used to treat recurrent ovarian cancer only when curative options were lacking, but new data indicate that it may be suitable as a primary treatment for patients with late-stage epithelial ovarian cancer, increasing the recurrence-free time interval and improving quality of life.  the aim of this study was to evaluate the outcome for patients with epithelial ovarian cancer treated with hyperthermic intraoperative chemotherapy (hipec) and completeness of cytoreduction (cc).  hyperthermic intraoperative intraperitoneal chemotherapy (hipec) along with radical surgery/peritonectomy could present a new therapeutic approach with curative intention.  hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (hipec) is an intriguing method of delivery wherein the cytotoxic agent is continuously heated and circulated throughout the peritoneum in an attempt to improve efficacy.  the use of hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (hipec) after cytoreductive surgery has been extensively studied in patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis from various malignancies.  hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (hipec) has been used for decades as a treatment for disseminated abdominal malignancies, including pseudomyxoma peritonei and peritoneal mesothelioma.  the aim of this study was to examine if hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (hipec) is an alternative modality to treat this category of patients along with a second attempt of surgical resection and second- or third-line systemic chemotherapy afterward. ||| ",yes
Could RG7112 be used as cancer therapy?,"r11 has been studied both as a cancer prevention agent, as well as, a cancer chemotherapeutic agent.  ro-07-0582 has thus been shown to have a radiosensitising effect in man and may therefore prove of value in radiotherapy.  a rhodacyanine dye called mkt-077 has shown a highly selective toxicity toward several distinct human malignant cell lines, including bladder carcinoma ej, and has been subjected to clinical trials for cancer therapy.  in the present study, compound-7g exhibited strong activity in suppressing proliferation and growth of glioblastoma cells.  gr63178a (nsc d611615) is the second pentacyclic pyrolloquinone to be evaluated clinically as an anticancer drug.  we have previously shown that compound-7g inhibits colorectal cancer cell proliferation and survival by inducing cell cycle arrest and pi3k/akt/mtor pathway blockage.  the clinical application of azd7762 as an adjuvant in the chemotherapy of osteosarcoma should be further explored.  thus, our preclinical results imply that wye-687 may have important translational value for the treatment of rcc.  knockdown of srp72 resulted in significant radiosensitization of hela (cervical), psn-1 (pancreatic), and t24 (bladder), bt-549 (breast) and mcf7 (breast) tumor lines as measured by colony formation assays.  r11 alone and in combination with other agents can be used for the treatment of cervical dysplasia or leukemia.  taxol is active against a number of cancers, some of which are also radiosensitive.  ra-700 inhibited lewis tumor growth in the early stage after tumor implantation, whereas deoxy-bouvardin and vcr did not.  azd7762 is a checkpoint kinase 1 (chk 1) inhibitor, which has been reported to sensitize many tumor cells to dna damage.  this suggests the potential application of rhtrail in the treatment of adenomas with high-grade dysplasia.  srp72 depletion also resulted in the radiosensitization of normal lung fibroblast cell lines (hfl1 and mrc-5), demonstrating that the effect is not restricted to tumor cells.  these results suggest that azd7762 could effectively promote cisplatin-induced apoptosis and mitotic catastrophe in osteosarcoma cells.  the antitumor activity of ra-700, a cyclic hexapeptide isolated from rubia cordifolia, was evaluated in comparison with deoxy-bouvardin and vincristine (vcr).  the aim of this study was to investigate whether it is possible to induce apoptosis in human adenoma cell lines and human adenomas using rhtrail.  in the present study, we demonstrated that azd7762 could enhance cisplatin-mediated apoptosis and mitotic catastrophe of osteosarcoma cells in vitro, and promote the inhibition of xenograft growth induced by cisplatin in vivo.  the farnesyl transferase inhibitor r115777 has been found to have clinical activity in diverse hematopoietic tumors. ||| ",yes
Could bioprinting be used in regenerative medicine against bone disease?,"in this review, we will discuss the potential of 3d bioprinting of bone tissue in the following disease states: osteoporosis, paget's disease, heterotopic ossification, osteosarcoma, osteogenesis imperfecta, and rickets disease.  in this context, our study aimed to develop a hybrid bioactive material suitable for 3d printing of scaffolds mimicking the natural composition and structure of healthy bone.  in this scenario, the bone tissue regeneration may be promoted using bioactive and biomimetic materials able to direct cell response, while the desired scaffold architecture can be tailored by means of 3d printing technologies.  bone tissue engineering offers an alternative promising solution to treat a large number of bone injuries with special focus on pathological conditions, such as osteoporosis.  remodeling of bone by tissue engineering is a realistic option for treating several bone-related pathophysiological ailments such as osteoporosis, bone tumor, bone cancer or abnormal bone development.  the development of these 3d bioprinted models will allow for the advancement of novel therapy testing resulting in possible relief to these chronic diseases.  this study exploits chemically modified mrnas, together with biomaterials, as a potential approach for the clinical treatment of bone injury and defects.  in conclusion, the reported results suggest that promising hybrid systems suitable for 3d printing of bioactive scaffolds for bone tissue engineering have been developed.  there is a growing need for successful bone tissue engineering strategies and advanced biomaterials that mimic the structure and function of native tissues carry great promise.  bone-tissue regeneration induced by biomimetic bioactive materials is the most promising approach alternative to the clinical ones used to treat bone loss caused by trauma or diseases such as osteoporosis.  bone tissue engineering is an emerging field of regenerative medicine that holds promise for the restoration of bones affected by trauma, neoplastic diseases, and congenital deformity.  clinical imperatives for new bone to replace or restore the function of traumatized or bone lost as a consequence of age or disease has led to the need for therapies or procedures to generate bone for skeletal applications.  tissue engineering has promoted structures that can simulate the extracellular matrix and are capable of guiding natural bone repair using signaling molecules to promote osteoinduction and angiogenesis essential in the formation of new bone tissues.  engineering of viable bone substitutes that can be personalized to meet specific clinical needs represents a promising therapeutic alternative.  to fight bone diseases characterized by poor bone quality like osteoporosis and osteoarthritis, as well as in reconstructive surgery, there is a need for a new generation of implantable biomaterials.  the goal is to design nanostructured bioactive constructs able to reproduce the physiological environment: by mimicking the natural features of bone tissue, the cell behavior during the regeneration process may be addressed.  in the last few years, rna-mediated gene therapy has captured attention as a new tool for bone regeneration.  these results pave the way for growing patient-specific bone substitutes for reconstructive treatments of the skeletal system and for constructing qualified experimental models of development and disease.  in this review, we discuss the use of rna molecules in coating and delivery, including messenger rna (mrna), rna interference (rnai), and long non-coding rna (lncrna) on different types of scaffolds (such as polymers, ceramics, and metals) in osteogenesis research.  from clinical applications to creating alternative structural materials, bone tissue engineering has been advancing constantly, and it is relevant to regularly update related topics. ||| ",yes
Could divalent metal transporter 1 deficiency lead to anemia?,"deficiency of the divalent metal transporter 1 (dmt1) leads to hypochromic microcytic anemia.  divalent metal-ion transporter 1 (dmt1) has been found to play an important role in the iron metabolism and hemogenesis.  besides iron, divalent metal-ion transporter 1 also transports other divalent metals.  the divalent metal transporter 1 (dmt1) is a major iron transporter required for iron absorption and erythropoiesis.  divalent metal transporter 1 (dmt1) is the major iron transporter responsible for duodenal dietary iron absorption and is required for erythropoiesis.  divalent metal-ion transporter-1 (dmt1) is a h(+)-coupled metal-ion transporter that plays essential roles in iron homeostasis.  divalent metal-ion transporter-1 (dmt1) is a widely expressed iron-preferring membrane-transport protein that serves a critical role in erythroid iron utilization.  divalent metal ion transporter 1 (dmt1) is a proton-coupled fe(2+)transporter that is essential for iron uptake in enterocytes and for transferrin-associated endosomal iron transport in many other cell types.  divalent metal-ion transporter-1 (dmt1) is a widely expressed, iron-preferring membrane transport protein.  the divalent metal transporter 1 (dmt1) is a multimetal transporter with a primary role in iron transport.  divalent metal transporter 1 (dmt1) mediates apical iron uptake into duodenal enterocytes and also transfers iron from the endosome into the cytosol after cellular uptake via the transferrin receptor.  trace metals influence the absorption of each other from the diet and it has been suggested that the divalent metal transporter (dmt1) represents a common uptake pathway for these important micronutrients.  iron is taken into enterocytes at the duodenum via apical divalent metal-ion transporter 1 protein.  hence, mutations in dmt1 cause systemic iron deficiency and anemia.  the major transport protein responsible for uptake of iron is divalent metal transporter 1 (dmt1) and recent studies demonstrate that the 1b species is regulated post-translationally by degradation via the proteasomal pathway.  overexpression of duodenal divalent metal transporter (dmt1) messenger rna occurs in hemochromatosis and hfe-knockout mice, suggesting that dmt1 mediates enhanced absorption of iron; however, increased expression of functional dmt1 protein has yet to be substantiated.  divalent metal transporter 1 (dmt1) is a transmembrane glycoprotein which mediates the proton-coupled transport of a variety of divalent metal ions.  our data confirm the major role of dmt1 in the maintenance of iron homeostasis in humans and demonstrate that the n491s mutation, through its deleterious effect on protein trafficking, contributes together with the g212v mutation to the development of anemia and hepatic iron overload.  divalent metal-ion transporter 1 (dmt1) may transport copper, but studies to date on this topic have been equivocal.  iron-copper model: mutations in the divalent metal transporter 1 (dmt1) decrease body iron status and up-regulate copper absorption, which leads to copper loading in the brain and consequently increases metal-induced oxidative stress. ||| ",yes
Could hypophosphatemic rickets cause craniosynostosis?,"craniosynostosis is an underdiagnosed complication of hypophosphatemic rickets.  craniosynostosis is an underdiagnosed complication associated with hypophosphatemic rickets.  hypophosphatemic rickets/osteomalacia is characterized by defective renal phosphate reabsorption and abnormal bone mineralization.  childhood hypophosphatemic rickets (hr) is most often caused by a defect in renal tubular resorption of filtered phosphorus.  there is a family history of genetically unconfirmed hypophosphatemic rickets in his mother.  familial hypophosphatemic rickets is characterized by defective skeletal mineralization resulting in abnormal growth and development.  in children, hypophosphatemic rickets (hr) is revealed by delayed walking, waddling gait, leg bowing, enlarged cartilages, bone pain, craniostenosis, spontaneous dental abscesses, and growth failure.  rickets and osteomalacia are associated with hypophosphatemia in several disease states, including x-linked hypophosphatemic rickets, autosomal-dominant hypophosphatemic rickets, and tumor-induced osteomalacia.  the study aims to describe the clinical and auxological characteristic of children with hypophosphatemic rickets and craniosynostosis, describe the usual treatment, and compare the characteristics with those of children without craniosynostosis.  our observations suggest that craniosynostosis secondary to rickets can develop in early infancy.  hypophosphatemia leads to rickets and osteomalacia, the latter of which results in decreased biomechanical integrity of bones, accompanied by poor fracture healing.  craniosynostosis can be gene-linked, or caused by metabolic diseases, such as rickets, which results from a deficiency or impaired metabolism of vitamin d, magnesium, phosphorus or calcium leading to hypomineralization of the bone.  targeted massively parallel resequencing of 196 candidate genes for hypophosphatemic rickets/osteomalacia was performed in the 86 affected unrelated individuals (cases) and in 100 unrelated healthy controls to identify new genes and mutations in known genes that cause hypophosphatemic rickets/osteomalacia.  x-linked hypophosphatemic rickets (xlhr) represents the most common form of genetic hypophosphatemia and causes rickets and osteomalacia in children because of increased fgf23 secretion and renal phosphate wasting.  here we describe a 29-year-old man with a history of childhood rickets who presented with increased renal phosphate clearance leading to hypophosphatemia, hypercalciuria, low serum parathyroid hormone (pth), elevated serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin d (1,25(oh)2d) and recurrent nephrolithiasis.  x-linked hypophosphatemic rickets (xlh) can occasionally cause premature fusion of cranial sutures through an increased level of fibroblast growth factor 23 (fgf-23), which leads to the dysregulation of phosphate and vitamin d metabolism.  rickets is a paradoxical complication of osteopetrosis resulting from the inability of the osteoclasts to maintain a normal calcium-phosphorus balance in the extracellular fluid.  we report on a boy who presented with hypophosphatemic rickets with elevated serum fibroblast growth factor 23 (fgf23) and polyostotic osteolytic lesions at age 2 years.  hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets with hypercalciuria (hhrh) is a new autosomal form of hypophosphatemic rickets, recently described.  a total of 86 hypophosphatemic rickets/osteomalacia patients (ranging from 3 to 70 years old) were recruited. ||| ",yes
Could plasmepsins be used as targets for developing anti-malaria drugs?,"therefore, the plasmepsins of malaria parasites have been recognized as attractive antimalarial drug targets.  plasmepsins (proteolytic enzymes of the parasite) have been considered as promising targets for the development of antimalarial drugs.  since plasmepsin inhibition leads to parasite death, these enzymes have been acknowledged to be important targets for the development of new antimalarial drugs.  malarial aspartic proteases - plasmepsins (plms) - are differentially expressed in multiple stages of the plasmodium parasite's lifecycle and are considered as attractive drug targets.  as inhibition of plasmepsins leads to the parasite's death, these enzymes can be utilized as potential drug targets.  the high sequence conservations between the plasmepsins from the isolates support the notion that the enzymes could be reliable targets for new antimalarial chemotherapeutics.  the plasmepsins are key enzymes in the life cycle of the plasmodium parasites responsible for malaria.  plasmepsin group of enzymes are key enzymes in the life cycle of malarial parasites.  the plasmepsins are the aspartic proteases of malaria parasites.  therefore, new compounds that potentially have a novel target in various developmental stages of plasmodium parasites are needed to treat patients and halt the spread of malaria.  potential new drug targets include plasmodium proteases that play critical roles in the parasite life cycle.  with the identification and characterization of new plasmepsins and the results from recent plasmepsin knockout studies, it now seems clear that in order to achieve high-antiparasitic activities in p. falciparum-infected erythrocytes it is necessary to inhibit several of the haemoglobin-degrading plasmepsins.  this review focuses on inhibitors of the haemoglobin-degrading plasmepsins of the most lethal species, p. falciparum; plm i, plm ii, plm iv, and histo-aspartic protease (hap).  the development of effective plasmepsin inhibitors, however, is compounded by their genomic diversity which gives rise not to a unique target for drug development but to a family of closely related targets.  plasmepsins, a family of aspartic proteases of plasmodium species, are known to participate in a wide variety of cellular processes essential for parasite survival.  identification of potential drug targets as well as development of novel antimalarial chemotherapies with unique mode of actions due to drug resistance by plasmodium parasites are inevitable.  in this paper, we discuss the synthesis, crystal structures and inhibitory nature of these two compounds which have a potential to inhibit plasmepsins.  advances in antimalarial drug development are important for combating malaria.  in this paper, we discuss the application of the thermodynamic approach to the development of high affinity (k(i) - pm) plasmepsin inhibitors.  the incidence of malaria is increasing, and there is an urgent need to identify new drug targets for both prophylaxis and chemotherapy. ||| ",yes
Could the Menzerath-Altmann law be proved mathematically trivial in genomes?,"the random breakage and variants keeping genome size and chromosome number independent raise no serious objection to the relevance of correlations consistent with menzerath-altmann law across taxonomic groups and the possibility of a connection between human language and genomes through that law.  based on this observation we propose a hypothesis for the law of menzerath-altmann in mammalian genes being predominantly due to genes that are more versatile in function and thus, more prone to undergo changes in their structure.  to this end we demonstrate one test case where gene categories of different functionality also show differences in the extent of conformity to menzerath-altmann law.  that scaling is a very particular case of menzerath-altmann law that has been rejected by means of a correlation test between x and y in genomes, being x the number of chromosomes of a species, y its genome size in bases and z the mean chromosome size.  recently, a random breakage model has been proposed to explain the negative correlation between mean chromosome length and chromosome number that is found in many groups of species and is consistent with menzerath-altmann law, a statistical law that defines the dependency between the mean size of the whole and the number of parts in quantitative linguistics.  exon sizes and exon numbers in genes have been shown to conform to a law derived from statistical linguistics and formulated by menzerath and altmann, according to which the mean size of the constituents of an entity is inversely related to the number of these constituents.  menzerath's law, the tendency of z (the mean size of the parts) to decrease as x (the number of parts) increases, is found in language, music and genomes.  the view of menzerath-altmann law as inevitable is seriously flawed.  here we review the statistical foundations of that test and consider three non-parametric tests based upon different correlation metrics and one parametric test to evaluate if z ∼ 1/x in genomes.  we show that extensive linear fits, representative of accordance to menzerath-altmann law are restricted to a particular subset of genes that are formed by exons under low or intermediate sequence constraints and have a small number of alternative transcripts.  recently, it has been argued that the presence of the law in genomes is an inevitable consequence of the fact that z=y/x, which would imply that z scales with x as z ∼ 1/x.  this assumption is shown to be unrealistic from the perspective of chromosome structure and the statistical analysis of real genomes.  here, the central assumption of the model, namely that genome size is independent from chromosome number is reviewed.  quite unexpectedly, kinetic theory is found to specify the correct definition of average value to be employed in nonextensive statistical mechanics.  it has also been indicated that darwin's influence on mendel, primarily from the origin, is evident.  although mendel is now widely recognized as the founder of genetics, historical studies have shown that he did not in fact propose the modern concept of paired characters linked to genes, nor did he formulate the two ""mendelian laws"" in the form now given.  we calculate explicitly how the macroscopic quantities (i.e., quantities that depend on the quantitative trait) depend on evolutionary forces, in a way that is independent of the microscopic details.  i argue that neither mendel understood the evolutionary significance of his findings for the problem of genetic variation, nor would darwin have understood their significance had he read mendel's paper.  we present a modified version of that approach, which makes the analogy more precise and applies quite generally to describe the evolution of allele frequencies.  i present a brief review of these criticisms and conclude that mendel deserved to be called the father of genetics even if he may not, and most likely did not, have clear ideas of segregation and particulate determiners as we know them now. ||| ",yes
Could transcription factors act as cell-cell signalling molecules?,"the function of transcription factors is modulated by intracellular signal transduction pathways, which are activated by specific ligands binding to the appropriate membrane receptors.  transcription factors determine cell lineages, control cell fate, and regulate cellular responses to stimuli.  dominant-negative transcription factors can be used to investigate the effect of signaling pathways on complex cellular processes that are regulated by a particular transcription factor.  it is suggested that if such transcription factors also had a mechanism to sense the expression level of the gene they control, then they could create a feedback loop able to keep expression of a gene within a limited range.  transcription factors are proteins that recognize specific dna sequences and affect local transcriptional processes.  transcription factor signalling networks are branched and interconnected so that any single transcription factor can activate many different genes and one gene can be activated by a combination of different transcription factors.  moreover co-activators or transcription intermediary factors, have been identified which could mediate some of the transcriptional effects of the hormone-receptor complex.  transcription factors are regulatory proteins that bind to specific sites of chromosomal dna to enact responses to intracellular and extracellular stimuli.  nuclear receptors comprise a family of transcription factors that regulate gene expression in a ligand dependent manner.  information about transcription factor binding sites can help determine which combinations of factors work together to regulate a gene, but it is unclear how far the binding data from one cell type can inform about regulation in other cell types.  by integrating data on co-localized transcription factor binding sites in the k562 cell line with expression data across 38 distinct hematopoietic cell types, we developed regression models to describe the relationship between the expression of target genes and the transcription factors that co-localize nearby.  transcription factors are involved in this regulatory process through their combinatorial binding with dna.  synergistic interaction between different classes of transcription factors bound to distinct sites within a promoter/enhancer region is one mechanism by which this can occur.  evidence from transfection studies and cell-free assays points to an interaction of the hormone receptors with general transcription factors, as well as with sequence-specific transcription factors.  understanding which dna sequences a particular transcription factor recognizes provides important clues into the set of genes that they regulate and, through this, their potential biological functions.  members of transcription factor families typically have similar dna binding specificities yet execute unique functions in vivo.  dna-binding transcription factors regulate the expression of genes near to where they bind.  ligand-dependent transcriptional regulation by nuclear receptors is believed to be mediated by intermediary factors (tifs) acting on remodelling of the chromatin structure and/or the activity of the transcriptional machinery.  identification of transcription factor (tf) activities associated with a certain physiological/experimental condition is one of the preliminary steps to reconstruct transcriptional regulatory networks and to identify signal transduction pathways.  our approach shows that gene expression can be explained by a modest number of co-localized transcription factors, however, information on cell-type specific binding is crucial for understanding combinatorial gene regulation. ||| ",yes
Do Conserved noncoding elements act as enhancers?,"enhancers are non-coding dna fragments which are crucial in gene regulation (e.g.  noncoding rnas (ncrnas) generated from enhancers have been proposed as a general facet of enhancer function and some have been shown to be required for enhancer activity.  conserved noncoding elements (cnes) in vertebrate genomes often act as developmental enhancers, but a critical issue is how well orthologous cne sequences retain the same activity in their respective species, a characteristic important for generalization of model organism studies.  since the discovery that many transcriptional enhancers are transcribed into long noncoding rnas termed ""enhancer rnas"" (ernas), their putative role in enhancer function has been debated.  recent studies have demonstrated that enhancers are often associated with non-coding rnas (ncrnas), yet the functional role of these enhancer:ncrna associations is unclear.  evolutionarily conserved non-coding genomic sequences represent a potentially rich source for the discovery of gene regulatory region such as transcriptional enhancers.  conserved noncoding elements (cnes) are elements exhibiting extreme noncoding conservation in metazoan genomes.  recent studies have revealed that active enhancers are transcribed, producing a class of noncoding rnas called enhancer rnas (ernas).  enhancer rnas (ernas) are a subset of long noncoding rna generated from genomic enhancers: they are thought to act as potent promoters of the expression of nearby genes through interaction with the transcriptional and epigenomic machineries.  enhancers have been conventionally perceived as cis-acting elements that provide binding sites for trans-acting factors.  long non-coding rnas (ncrna) have recently been demonstrated to be expressed from a subset of enhancers and to be required for the distant regulation of gene expression.  enhancer rnas (ernas) are a novel class of non-coding rna (ncrna) molecules transcribed from the dna sequences of enhancer regions.  in general, splicing regulatory elements are defined as enhancers or silencers depending on their positive or negative effect upon exon inclusion.  enhancers and antisense rnas play key roles in transcriptional regulation through differing mechanisms.  our findings present a new view of enhancer action wherein enhancers may direct isoform-specific expression of genes through ncrna intermediates.  distant-acting transcriptional enhancers are particularly challenging to uncover because they are scattered among the vast non-coding portion of the genome.  however, recent studies have shown that enhancers are transcribed and that these transcripts, called enhancer rnas (ernas), have a regulatory function.  evolutionary sequence constraint can facilitate the discovery of enhancers, but fails to predict when and where they are active in vivo.  emerging studies, showing that ernas function in controlling mrna transcription, challenge the idea that enhancers are merely sites of transcription factor assembly.  in this work, we explore the utility of adding the notion of conserved core regions into a comparative genomics approach for the search for putative functional elements in noncoding dna. ||| ",yes
Do DNA double-strand breaks play a causal role in carcinogenesis?,"genotoxic carcinogens which interact with dna may produce double-strand breaks as normal intermediates of homologous mitotic recombination, and may give rise to structural chromosome aberrations and inter-chromosomal deletion-recombination.  much evidence has suggested that dna double-strand breaks (dsb) are important lesions.  dna damage is recognized as a central component of carcinogenesis.  dna double-strand breaks (dsbs) are particularly lethal and genotoxic lesions, that can arise either by endogenous (physiological or pathological) processes or by exogenous factors, particularly ionizing radiation and radiomimetic compounds.  numerous environmental carcinogens involve radical formation interacting with dna to produce 2-deoxyribonolactone (dl), a major type of oxidized abasic site, implicated in dna strand breaks, mutagenesis, and formation of covalent dna-protein cross-links (dpc).  while there is general acceptance that the dna double-strand break (dsb) is the principal initiating lesion the complexity of the relationship between the induced frequency and the rates of repair and misjoining of dsb, and the production of chromosome and chromatid aberrations has led to much controversy.  although dsbs are potentially carcinogenic, it is not clear whether complex dsbs that are refractory to repair are more potently tumorigenic compared with simple breaks that can be rapidly repaired, correctly or incorrectly, by mammalian cells.  although there was some intercellular heterogeneity, these results confirm that dna double-strand breaks do result in chromosome aberrations but that these breaks are not sufficient to give rise to sce formation.  complex dna damage may manifest in double-strand breaks (dsbs) and non-dsb, bistranded, oxidatively induced clustered dna lesions (ocdls).  in the present study we investigated whether a relationship exists between dna strand breakage and base modification.  to investigate the role of double-strand breakage in sce formation, we constructed a plasmid that gives rise to one specific lesion, a staggered-end (""cohesive"") dna double-strand break.  it is reasoned that a cell deficient in dna repair is more likely to acquire other cancer-promoting mutations.  this modified dna can be repaired enzymatically, but, if not, these modifications are believed to be responsible for the initiation of carcinogenic processes.  oxidative damage to dna seems to be an important factor in developing many human diseases including cancer.  after that, newer knowledge is reviewed that (i) strand breaks are created during normal dna unravelling (by topoisomerases), during dna synthesis, and during dna repairs, and these breaks can be single- or double-stranded, (ii) breaks variously associated with unravelling, synthesis and repair can occur 'anywhere, anytime' (pre-synthesis, synthesis or post-synthesis) in the cell cycle, and (iii) the enzyme assemblies for dna unravelling, synthesis and repair which make and religate the breaks must be non-covalently tethered to the ends of the dna strands while the breaks created by the enzymes are in existence.  establishing a cause and effect relationship between initial levels of dna dsb, their repair rate or the level of residual unrepaired breaks, and cellular effects has proved difficult in mammalian cells.  single or double strand breaks, bases modifications or deletions, intra- or interstrand dna-dna or dna-protein cross-links constitute the major lesions formed in different proportions according to agents and to dna sequence context.  dna double-strand breaks (dsbs) are the most deleterious lesion inflicted by ionizing radiation.  chromosome aberrations appear to result directly from dna double-strand breaks, but the lesion(s) giving rise to sce formation remains unknown.  dna damage, arising from endogenous metabolism or exposure to environmental agents, may perturb the transmission of genetic information by blocking dna replication and/or inducing mutations, which contribute to the development of cancer and likely other human diseases. ||| ",yes
Do IEG create a ripple effect of transcription?,"ripples that were visualized consistently using both ordinary filters and the eeg″ method should be true, but failure to clarify ripples using the eeg″ method does not mean that true ripples are absent.  we sought to determine if ripple oscillations (80-120 hz), detected in intracranial electroencephalogram (ieeg) recordings of patients with epilepsy, correlate with an enhancement or disruption of verbal episodic memory encoding.  we excluded such possibility from at least some ripples by eeg differentiation, which, in theory, enhances high-frequency signals and does not generate spurious oscillations or ringing.  although physiological and pathological ripple oscillations were not distinguished during cognitive tasks, our results show an association of undifferentiated ripples with impaired encoding.  we found that the occurrence of ieds is modified by whether a subject is attending to a word displayed on screen or is observing a blank screen.  the interaction of cortical modules in sleep and wake in tle may influence the appearance of ieds on scalp eeg; in addition, ieds could be proxies for cerebral oscillation perturbation.  we found that ieds were associated with an increase in low-frequency power and a change in the balance between low- and high-frequency oscillations for several seconds.  the impacts of ied presence, duration, and propagation to neocortex during encoding of individual stimuli were assessed.  however, it is currently unknown how these epileptic ics depend on the presence of interictal epileptic discharges (ieds) in the eeg.  the goal of this study was to explore the relation between ics obtained from fmri epochs during the occurrence of ieds in the eeg and those without ieds.  furthermore, ieds have been shown to impair memory when they occur in certain regions during the encoding or recall phases of a memory task.  we defined ripple and spike events in depth ieeg recordings during list learning in 107 patients with focal epilepsy.  as controls, subjects with maximum activation in the ied generating region were selected.  the influence of ieds during recall was further investigated by comparing the likelihood of ieds preceding correctly recalled items vs. periods of no verbal response.  interictal epileptiform discharges (ieds) constitute a perturbation of ongoing cerebral rhythms, usually more frequent during sleep.  ripple-band epileptic high-frequency oscillations (hfos) can be recorded by scalp electroencephalography (eeg), and tend to be associated with epileptic spikes.  we used logistic regression models (lrms) to investigate the relationship between the occurrence of ripple and spike events during word presentation and the odds of successful word recall following a distractor epoch and included the seizure onset zone (soz) as a covariate in the lrms.  the probability of ripple on spike (rons) events was increased in the soz (p < 0.04).  we introduce here a process that modifies the eeg in a predictable manner so as to increase the incidence of a particular pattern.  interictal epileptiform discharges during encoding, maintenance, and recall did not significantly impact task performance, and there was no significant difference between the likelihood of ieds during correct recall vs. periods of no response. ||| ",yes
Do Parkinson's disease patients experience stridor?,"this case emphasises the importance of recognising different causes of stridor in parkinson's disease patients, as this affects management.  parkinson disease (pd) is a common progressive neurodegenerative condition, causing both motor and non motor symptoms.  parkinson's disease (pd) is commonly characterized by its motor symptoms such as resting tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia and postural instability; however, some of the most debilitating symptoms of this disease are non-motor ones such as dementia and sialorrhea (drooling).  (1) to present a rare case of stridor secondary to prolonged laryngospasm in a patient with parkinson's disease, and (2) to review the literature on stridor in parkinson's disease.  parkinson's disease (pd) is clinically characterized by a resting tremor, bradykinesia, cogwheel phenomenon, rigidity, disorder of postural reflexes and especially changes in voice and speech.  increasingly, parkinson's disease has been associated with a broad spectrum of non-motor symptoms, such as olfactory loss, sleep disorders, autonomic dysfunction, cognitive impairment, psychosis, depression, anxiety, and apathy.  the literature was reviewed, following a medline search using the keywords 'parkinson's disease' and 'stridor' or 'airway obstruction' or 'laryngospasm' or 'laryngeal dystonia' or 'bilateral vocal cord palsy'.  parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by bradykinesia, rigidity, postural instability, and resting tremor.  parkinson's disease (pd) is most frequently associated with characteristic motor symptoms that are known to arise with degeneration of dopaminergic neurons.  only 12 previously reported cases of stridor in parkinson's disease patients were identified.  symptoms of abnormal autonomic-nervous-system function occur commonly in parkinson's disease (pd).  some investigators have proposed that parkinson's disease (pd) patients often exhibit a worsening of tremor before the emergence of levodopa-induced dyskinesia (ldd).  parkinson's disease (pd) is a neurodegenerative disorder that impacts motor and nonmotor systems, and consequently influences voice.  the respiratory symptoms observed in parkinson's disease patients vary greatly.  we previously reported that parkinson's disease (pd) patients treated with subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (stn-dbs) had distinct phenotypes of speech and voice disorders: hypokinetic dysarthria, stuttering, breathy voice, strained voice, and spastic dysarthria.  dysarthria and dysphagia are known to occur in parkinsonian syndromes such as parkinson disease (pd), dementia with lewy bodies (dlb), corticobasal degeneration (cbd), multiple system atrophy (msa), and progressive supranuclear palsy (psp).  we report a 73-year-old parkinson's disease patient who developed acute stridor due to prolonged laryngospasm triggered by overspill of excessive secretions.  patients with parkinson's disease commonly complain of voice dysfunction.  these findings correlate with the perception of patients with parkinson's disease that they are working harder to produce phonation.  laryngeal tremor was observed early in the disease in these parkinson's disease patients. ||| ",yes
Do R-loops tend to form at sites of DNA replication?,"r-loops are three-stranded structures that harbour an rna-dna hybrid and frequently form during transcription.  r-loops are non-b dna structures that form during transcription when the nascent rna anneals to the template dna strand forming a rna:dna hybrid.  r-loops are nucleic acid hybrids which form when an rna invades duplex dna to pair with its template sequence.  r loops form when transcripts hybridize to homologous dna on chromosomes, yielding a dna:rna hybrid and a displaced dna single strand.  r-loops are features of chromatin consisting of a strand of dna hybridized to rna, as well as the expelled complementary dna strand.  r-loops, consisting of an rna-dna hybrid and displaced single-stranded dna, are physiological structures that regulate various cellular processes occurring on chromatin.  in this review, we summarize recent results implicating r-loops as important regulators of cellular processes such as transcription termination, gene regulation, and dna repair.  r-loops are structures consisting of an rna-dna duplex and an unpaired dna strand.  r-loop formation occurs when the nascent rna hybridizes with the template dna strand behind the rna polymerase.  r-loops are prevalent three-stranded non-b dna structures composed of an rna-dna hybrid and a single strand of dna.  r-loops are formed when replicative forks collide with the transcriptional machinery and can cause genomic instability.  together, these studies provide a high-resolution map of r-loops and identify gene structure as a critical determinant of r-loop formation.  r-loops, which consist of a dna/rna hybrid and a displaced single-stranded dna (ssdna), are increasingly recognized as critical regulators of chromatin biology.  r-loops affect a wide range of cellular processes and their use as origins of replication was the first function attributed to them.  r-loops are common across many domains of life and cause dna damage in certain contexts.  in addition to their recognized roles in triggering dna double-strand breaks (dsbs), r-loops have recently been demonstrated to accumulate in cis to dsbs, especially those induced in transcriptionally active loci.  we found the location of promoter-associated r-loops is dependent on the presence of introns.  r-loops are a major source of genome instability associated with transcription-induced replication stress.  varied evidence indicates that dna replication occurs in replication foci organized upon the nm and that structural dna loops may correspond to the replicons in vivo.  r-loops are non-b dna structures with intriguing dual consequences for gene expression and genome stability. ||| ",yes
Do RNA:DNA hybrids preferentially form in high or low GC regions?,"rna:dna hybrids form when nascent transcripts anneal to the dna template strand or any homologous dna region.  g-rich tracts of rna form g-quadruplexes, while gc-rich sequences prefer stem-loop structures.  gc skew favors r-loops, a type of three stranded nucleic acid structures that form upon annealing of an rna strand to one strand of dna, creating a persistent rna:dna hybrid.  hybridization of rna to its template dna strand during transcription induces formation of r-loops-rna:dna hybrids with unpaired non-template dna strands.  single-stranded guanine-rich rna sequences have a propensity to fold into compact g-quadruplexes (rg4s).  knowledge of the relative stabilities of s-dna.rna hybrids of different sequences is important for choosing rna targets for hybridization with antisense phosphorothioate oligodeoxyribonucleotides (s-dnas).  cd spectra of s-dna.rna hybrids were sequence-dependent and were similar to those of analogous unmodified hybrids.  in general, sequence-dependent cd spectra and tm values of s-dna.rna hybrids appear to reflect the unique nearest-neighbor interactions of adjacent base pairs, where the s-dna and rna strands are in different, but relatively uniform, conformations.  the s-dna.rna hybrids had a sequence-dependence of melting temperatures that was approximately the same as that calculated using published data for normal dna.rna hybrids .  previous studies show that gc skew is prevalent at thousands of human cpg island (cgi) promoters and transcription termination regions, which correspond to hotspots of r-loop formation.  when denatured, the rna sequences that form the double-stranded regions hybridize rapidly to hela cell dna, suggesting that they are transcribed from reiterated sites in the genome.  the equilibrium between alternate structures within rna may occur and influence its functionality.  rna and dna adopt different types of conformations, i.e., a-type with c3'-endo sugar pucker for rna and b-type with c2'-endo sugar pucker for dna, respectively.  guanine-rich sequences are able to form complex rna structures termed rna g-quadruplexes in vitro.  a dark side of the matter is that rna:dna hybrids are also a cause of dna damage and human diseases.  heterogeneous nuclear rna from hela cells contains double-stranded regions that arise by base pairing of complementary sequences that exist as parts of the same molecule (intramolecular base pairing).  transient association of guanine-rich rna and dna in the form of hetero-g-quadruplexes (rdqs) has emerged as an important mechanism for regulating genome transcription and replication but relatively little is known about the structure and biophysical properties of rdqs compared with dna and rna homo-g-quadruplexes.  furthermore, we reveal that promoter gc skew peaks at the exon 1/ intron1 junction and that it is highly correlated with gene age and cgi promoter strength.  using rg4-seq, we profile the landscape of those guanine-rich regions with the in vitro folding potential in the arabidopsis transcriptome.  circular dichroism (cd) spectra and melting temperatures were acquired for 16 hybrid sequences that could be formed by mixing s-dna and rna oligomers of 24 nucleotides in length. ||| ",yes
Do T-Cells regulate neuropathic pain?,"increasing evidence suggests that t cells and glia participate in the process of neuropathic pain.  t lymphocytes mediate adaptive immune responses and have been suggested to generate neuropathic pain.  these findings suggest the modulation of the t-cell immune response as a potential target for the treatment of neuropathic pain.  here, we investigated the contribution of regulatory t (treg) cells to the development of neuropathic pain by using a partial sciatic nerve ligation model in mice.  here, we investigated the contribution of regulatory t (treg) cells to the development of neuropathic pain by using a partial sciatic nerve ligation model in mice.  in contrast, in this study we investigated t cells as a source of opioidergic analgesic β-endorphin for the control of augmented tactile sensitivity following neuropathy.  these results revealed treg cells as important inhibitory modulators of the immune response at the site of peripheral nerve injury that restrains the development of neuropathic pain.  these results revealed treg cells as important inhibitory modulators of the immune response at the site of peripheral nerve injury that restrains the development of neuropathic pain.  however, the physiological significance and potential contribution of t cells to neuropathic pain remains unclear.  emerging clinical data suggest that patients with chronic pain have a different phenotypic profile of circulating t cells compared to controls.  specific t cell subsets release mediators such as cytokines and endogenous opioid peptides that can promote, suppress, or even resolve pain.  the inflammatory/immune response at the site of peripheral nerve injury participates in the pathophysiology of neuropathic pain.  the inflammatory/immune response at the site of peripheral nerve injury participates in the pathophysiology of neuropathic pain.  depending on the type of injury, the subset of t cells and the sex of the animal, t cells may contribute to the onset and/or the resolution of pain, underlining t cells as a major player in the transition from acute to chronic pain.  our findings reveal β-endorphin-containing t cells as a crucial component of beneficial adaptive immune responses associated with painful peripheral nerve injuries.  local treg cells suppressed the development of neuropathic pain mainly through the inhibition of the cd4 th1 response.  local treg cells suppressed the development of neuropathic pain mainly through the inhibition of the cd4 th1 response.  however, t cells, one of the main regulators of the immune response, have only recently become a focus of investigations on chronic pain pathophysiology.  finally, we identified il-10 signaling as an intrinsic mechanism by which treg cells counteract neuropathic pain development.  finally, we identified il-10 signaling as an intrinsic mechanism by which treg cells counteract neuropathic pain development. ||| ",yes
Do U6-associated proteins Lsm4 and Lsm6 interact with SMN?,"here we describe a novel set of sm-like (lsm) proteins in saccharomyces cerevisiae that interact with each other and with u6 snrna.  seven lsm proteins form a complex, which interacts with the u6 snrna and functions in splicing.  this confirmed the association of the lsm2p-lsm8p complex with u6 snrna.  in eukaryotes, seven sm proteins bind to the u1, u2, u4 and u5 spliceosomal snrnas while seven smlike proteins (lsm2p-lsm8p) are associated with u6 snrna.  another yeast sm-like protein, lsm1p, does not interact with u6 snrna.  seven lsm proteins co-immunoprecipitate with the previously characterized lsm4p (uss1p) and interact with each other in two-hybrid analyses.  recent results have identified a family of lsm (like sm) proteins that are related to the sm protein family.  a complex of seven lsm proteins, lsm2-8, associates with the u6 small nuclear rna (snrna) that is a component of spliceosome complexes in which pre-mrna splicing occurs.  analyses of u4/u6 di-snrnps and u4/u6.u5 tri-snrnps in lsm-depleted strains suggest that lsm proteins may play a role in facilitating conformational rearrangements of the u6 snrnp in the association-dissociation cycle of spliceosome complexes.  experiments in which the binding of lsm proteins to snr5 was reconstituted in vitro reveal that the 3' end of snr5 is critical for lsm protein recognition.  furthermore, in agreement with the em observations, uv cross-linking revealed u6 rna in contact with the lsm2 protein at the interface between prp24p and the lsm ring.  in yeast, the lsm2-lsm8 complex binds and stabilizes the spliceosomal u6 snrna, whereas the lsm1-lsm7 complex functions in mrna decay.  free u6 and u4/u6 duplexed rnas co-immunoprecipitate with seven of the lsm proteins that are essential for the stable accumulation of u6 snrna.  thus, lsm proteins form a complex that differs from the canonical sm complex in its rna association(s) and function.  lsm proteins are ubiquitous, multifunctional proteins that affect the processing of most rnas in eukaryotic cells, but their function is unknown.  sm-like (lsm) proteins function in a variety of rna-processing events.  rnp reconstitution experiments with exogenous u6 rna show that lsm proteins promote the formation of u6-containing complexes and suggest that lsm proteins have a chaperone-like function, supporting the assembly or remodeling of rnp complexes involved in splicing.  protein components of the u6 snrnp (prp24p and lsm2-8) are thought to act cooperatively in facilitating the annealing of u6 and u4 snrnas during u4/u6 di-snrnp formation.  in addition, a different complex of lsm proteins interacts with cytoplasmic mrna and promotes its turnover.  our data identify the smn complex as a multivalent hub where sm proteins are collected in its periphery to allow their joining with usnrna. ||| ",yes
Do all archaea possess multiple origins of DNA replication?,"while some archaea possess a bacterial-like mode of dna replication with single origins of replication per chromosome, the majority of species characterized to date possess chromosomes with multiple replication origins.  furthermore, recent work has shown that archaea, like eukaryotes, have multiple replication origins.  the use of multiple origins for chromosome replication has been demonstrated in archaea.  two studies have shown that multiple origins of replication function in two archaeal species.  dna replication is initiated at origins and is highly conserved in eukaryotes, but our limited understanding of archaea has uncovered a wide diversity of replication initiation mechanisms.  the use of multiple replication origins in archaea is not well understood.  bacteria and some archaea replicate from single origins, whereas most archaea and all eukaryotes replicate using multiple origins.  archaea, the third domain of life, use a single or multiple origin(s) to initiate replication of their circular chromosomes.  this review summarizes the research progress in understanding of archaeal replication origins with particular focus on the utilization, control and evolution of multiple replication origins in haloarchaea.  this review summarizes the search for origins of replication in archaea, and our current knowledge of initiation, the process by which replication origins are recognized, the dna molecule is unwound and the replicative helicase is loaded onto the dna in preparation for dna synthesis.  these are the first reports of archaea having multiple origins.  similar to the dormant origins in eukaryotes, some potential origins in archaea appear to be inactive during genome replication.  unlike bacteria, archaea may have multiple origins per chromosome and multiple orc1/cdc6 initiator proteins.  this is the first report revealing diverse control mechanisms of origins in haloarchaea, which has provided novel insights into the use and coordination of multiple replication origins in the domain of archaea.  in this review, the current knowledge of the mechanisms governing dna replication in archaea is summarized.  archaea therefore have a unique replication system showing mechanistic similarities to both bacteria and eukarya.  the recently published complete genome sequences of some archaeal species together with preliminary biochemical studies suggest that the archaea quite likely duplicate their chromosome by using replication machinery that seems to be a simplified version of the eukaryotic machinery, although their metabolic facets and their cellular morphology are prokaryotic-like.  the basic structure of replication origins is conserved among archaea, typically including an at-rich unwinding region flanked by several conserved repeats (origin recognition box, orb) that are located adjacent to a replication initiator gene.  these results indicate that origin-dependent replication is strictly required for h. mediterranei and that dormant replication origins in archaea can be activated if needed.  this diversity in dna replication initiation is all the more remarkable for having been discovered in only three groups of archaea where in vivo studies are possible. ||| ",no
Do bacteria from the genus Morexella cause respiratory infections?,"moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis is now recognized as an important cause of respiratory tract infections.  moraxella (formerly branhamella) catarrhalis is a gram-negative coccus now recognized as one of the common pathogens in respiratory infections.  moraxella catarrhalis is an important pathogen in patients with chronic obstructive lung disease (copd).  the recognition of moraxella catarrhalis as an important cause of respiratory tract infections has been protracted, mainly because it is a frequent commensal organism of the upper respiratory tract and the diagnostic sensitivity of blood or pleural fluid culture is low.  moraxella catarrhalis is a commensal organism of the respiratory tract that has emerged as an important pathogen for a variety of upper and lower respiratory tract infections including otitis media and acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis.  moraxella catarrhalis is implicated in the pathogenesis of some copd exacerbations.  moraxella catarrhalis is a common pathogen found in children with upper respiratory tract infections and in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease during exacerbations.  to study the role of moraxella (subgenus branhamella) catarrhalis (b. catarrhalis) adherence to airway cells in lower respiratory tract infections, the in vitro attachments of b. catarrhalis to upper airway (oropharyngeal) and lower airway (bronchial) epithelial cells were compared.  moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis, a mucosal pathogen closely related to neisseria species, is a prominent cause of otitis media in young children and lower respiratory tract infections in adults.  we investigated whether the ability of commensal respiratory bacteria to modulate the innate immune response against bacterial and viral pathogens was a shared or strain-specific characteristic.  h. influenzae and b. catarrhalis, together with s. pneumoniae, are the most common bacteria responsible for upper respiratory tract infections, namely otitis and sinusitis.  over a two year period, moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis was isolated in pure culture from 3.4% of the sputums collected from patients with symptoms of acute respiratory tract infections.  moraxella catarrhalis, formerly called branhamella catarrhalis, 'neisseria catarrhalis' or 'micrococcus catarrhalis', is a gram-negative, aerobic diplococcus frequently found as a colonizer of the upper respiratory tract.  two cases of moraxella catarrhalis bacteremic pneumonia in immunosuppressed adult patients are reported.  haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae and m. catarrhalis were the main causative agents responsible for respiratory tract infections.  moraxella catarrhalis (m. catarrhalis) may normally be found in the upper respiratory tract.  the activity of these bacteria in the onset of otitis and sinusitis is reported.  the seasonal recovery of moraxella catarrhalis in respiratory infections is significantly increased during the late fall through early spring period.  moraxella catarrhalis is an important pathogen of humans.  our results suggest that the presence of amoxicillin-resistant m. catarrhalis originating from β-lactamase-containing omvs may pave the way for respiratory pathogens that by definition are susceptible to β-lactam antibiotics. ||| ",yes
Do brown fat cells produce heat?,"does human brown fat actually combust fat to release heat?  brown adipocytes and beige adipocytes can expend energy, generate heat, and increase whole-body energy expenditure.  brown and beige (or brite) fat cells are capable of evoking non-shivering thermogenesis in response to cold and β-adrenergic stimulation.  brown adipocytes are the key cell type in brown adipose tissue (bat) that express the genes required for heat production through the process of thermogenesis.  brown adipocytes oxidize fatty acids to produce heat in response to cold or caloric overfeeding.  brown and beige adipocytes expend chemical energy to produce heat and are therefore important in regulating body temperature and body weight.  brown fat (brown adipose tissue, bat) primary function is to produce heat.  brown adipocytes are best known for their ability to convert chemical energy into heat.  brown fat is a specialized fat depot that can increase energy expenditure and produce heat.  brown adipocytes generate heat through the expression of mitochondrial ucp1.  brown adipocytes and the related beige adipocytes oxidize fatty acids and glucose to generate heat and are activated by cold exposure or consumption of high-calorie diets.  brown and beige adipocytes are mitochondria-enriched cells capable of dissipating energy in the form of heat.  brown adipose tissue (bat) can generate heat by burning fatty acids, a process mediated by uncoupling protein 1 (ucp1).  brown adipose tissue (bat) is specialized for uncoupled heat production through mitochondrion fueled majorly from fatty acids (fas) of lipid droplets (lds).  that adult humans possess brown fat is now accepted - but is the brown fat metabolically active?  brown and brown-like adipocytes are specialized adipocytes with a high capacity to convert metabolic energy to heat.  brown adipose tissue, the principal thermogenic organ, quickly and efficiently increases heat production by dissipating the mitochondrial proton motive force.  it has been suggested that activation of brown fat, via either environmental (i.e.  beige cells are brown-like adipocytes that arise in white adipose tissue in response to certain environmental cues to dissipate heat and improve metabolic homeostasis.  brown adipocytes (bas) are specialized for adaptive thermogenesis and, upon sympathetic stimulation, activate mitochondrial uncoupling protein (ucp)-1 and oxidize fatty acids to generate heat. ||| ",yes
Do carmustine wafers improve survival of glioblastoma patients?,"carmustine (bcnu) wafers (gliadel) prolongs local disease control and progression-free survival (pfs) in patients with malignant gliomas.  carmustine wafers are approved for localized treatment of malignant glioma.  our meta-analysis focused on whether carmustine wafer treatment could significantly benefit the survival of patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme (gbm).  the aim of this study was to a conduct a systematic review of carmustine wafers (gliadel wafers) for the treatment of glioblastoma multiforme (gbm) to assess the survival benefit and safety of this therapy.  carmustine wafers, which are locally delivered chemotherapy in the form of biodegradable implants, confer a survival benefit to patients with glioblastoma (gb) following surgical resection.  locoregional chemotherapy with carmustine wafers, positioned at surgery and followed by radiation therapy, has been shown to prolong survival in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma, as has concomitant radiochemotherapy with temozolomide.  to assess together safety, tolerance and efficacy of carmustine wafer implantation and of extent of resection for glioblastoma patients in real-life experience.  carmustine (bcnu)-impregnated biodegradable polymer wafers have been shown to prolong survival in patients with recurrent malignant glioma.  there is a growing body of evidence that carmustine wafer implantation during surgery is an effective therapeutic adjunct to the standard combined radio-chemotherapy regimen using temozolomide in newly diagnosed and recurrent high-grade glioma patient management with a statistically significant survival benefit demonstrated across several randomized clinical trials, as well as prospective and retrospective studies (grade a recommendation).  carmustine wafers (gliadel wafer) are implanted at resection in some patients with high-grade gliomas.  placement of carmustine-impregnated wafers has become a common practice after surgical resection of malignant gliomas.  carmustine (1,3-bis-1-nitrosurea (bcnu)) wafers are approved for the local treatment of newly diagnosed and recurrent malignant glioma.  carmustine-impregnated wafers play a significant role in improving survival when used for patients with newly diagnosed gbm.  insertion of carmustine wafers into the resection cavity as a treatment for malignant glioma is currently a controversial topic among neurosurgeons.  carmustine wafer implantation in combination with maximal resection, followed by standard combined chemoradiotherapy is safe, efficient, and well-tolerated in newly diagnosed supratentorial glioblastomas in adults.  carmustine (1,3-bis -1-nitrosourea, or bcnu) wafers are approved for recurrent glioblastoma and newly diagnosed malignant glioma (mg).  it has been recently shown that carmustine wafers in addition to other therapies (surgery, temozolomide, and radiation) can further extend survival.  observational retrospective monocentric study including 340 consecutive adult patients with a newly diagnosed supratentorial glioblastoma who underwent surgical resection with (n = 123) or without (n = 217) carmustine wafer implantation as first-line oncological treatment.  finally, carmustine wafer implantation appears to be cost-effective in high-grade glioma patients when performed by an experienced team and when total or subtotal resection can be achieved.  in this study, overall changes in computed tomography (ct) and magnetic resonance (mr) images of malignant glioma patients treated with carmustine wafer implantation were evaluated. ||| ",yes
Do cephalopods use RNA editing less frequently than other species?,"we show, that as in cephalopods, adar genes in amphioxus are predominantly expressed in the nervous system; we identify a number of rna editing events in amphioxus; and we provide a newly developed method to identify rna editing events in highly polymorphic genomes using orthology as a guide.  cephalopods use it extensively to increase the regulatory complexity of their nervous systems, and mammals use it too, but less prominently.  here we analyze a key element of the editing machinery, the adar (adenosine deaminase acting on rna) gene family, in an animal with a key phylogenetic position at the root of chordates: the cephalochordate amphioxus.  overall, our work lays the foundations for future comparative analysis of rna-editing events across the metazoan tree.  a search of the cephalochordate cnes around 50 developmental genes in several vertebrate genomes revealed eight cnes conserved between cephalochordates and vertebrates, indicating sequence conservation over >500 million years of divergence.  rna editing is a relatively unexplored process in which transcribed rna is modified at specific nucleotides before translation, adding another level of regulation of gene expression.  cephalochordates, the sister group of vertebrates + tunicates, are evolving particularly slowly.  to more effectively identify cnes with potential regulatory functions, we compared noncoding sequences of genomes of the most phylogenetically distant cephalochordate genera, asymmetron and branchiostoma, which diverged approximately 120-160 million years ago.  non-coding y rnas and stem-bulge rnas are homologous small rnas in vertebrates and nematodes, respectively.  relative rate of sequence evolution showed that caecilian hox genes evolved significantly more slowly than the other tetrapod species used in this study and were comparable to the slowly evolving coelacanth hox genes.  nevertheless, little is known about the specifics of rna editing in most of the other clades and the relevance of rna editing from an evolutionary perspective remains unknown.  rates of synonymous and nonsynonymous nucleotide substitutions and codon usage bias (enc) were estimated for a number of nuclear and chloroplast genes in a sample of centric and pennate diatoms.  cephalochordates (amphioxus) are invertebrate chordates closely related to vertebrates.  here we describe methods for continuous laboratory breeding cultures of the cephalochordate branchiostoma floridae and the talen and tol2 methods for mutagenesis.  in the present study, we analyzed newly obtained ribosomal gene sequences of the odontostomatids discomorphella pedroeneasi and saprodinium dentatum, together with sequences from the literature, including epalxella antiquorum and a large assemblage of ciliate sequences representing the major recognized classes.  these methods should be applicable to any warm water species of cephalochordates with a relatively short generation time of 3-4 months and a life span of 3 years or more.  both rnas are phylogenetically closer related to nematode sbrnas than to vertebrate y rnas.  the crustacean genes are significantly less a + t-rich than their counterpart in insects and the pattern of codon usage (ratio of g + c-rich versus a + t-rich codon) is less biased.  a single cluster of functional genes is preserved throughout tetrapod evolution, which however exhibits clade-specific tandem duplications, gene-losses, and rearrangements.  in contrast to other invertebrates studied, mnemiopsis leidyi has lower levels of genome-wide 5-mc methylation, but higher levels of 5-mc methylation in promoters when compared with gene bodies. ||| ",no
Do chromatin features predict genes associated with eQTLs?,"expression quantitative trait loci (eqtls) help to explain the regulatory mechanisms underlying these genetic associations.  the collection of expression quantitative trait loci (eqtls) is an important resource to study complex traits through understanding where and how transcriptional regulations are controlled by genetic variations in the non-coding regions of the genome.  expression quantitative trait loci (eqtls) are genetic variants that affect gene expression.  expression quantitative trait loci (eqtls) studies provide associations of genetic variants with gene expression but fall short of pinpointing functionally important eqtls.  expression quantitative trait loci (eqtl) can provide a link between disease susceptibility variants discovered by genetic association studies and biology.  by connecting large-scale epigenomic profiles to expression quantitative trait loci (eqtls) in a wide range of human tissues/cell types, we identify critical chromatin features that predict variant regulatory potential.  expression quantitative trait loci (eqtl) are genomic regions regulating rna transcript expression levels.  expression quantitative trait loci (eqtls) characterize the associations between genetic variation and gene expression to provide insights into tissue-specific gene regulation.  gene expression is influenced by variants commonly known as expression quantitative trait loci (eqtl).  although expression quantitative trait loci (eqtls) have been powerful in identifying susceptibility genes from genome-wide association study (gwas) findings, most trait-associated loci are not explained by eqtls alone.  expression quantitative trait locus (eqtl) analysis is a powerful tool to study the biological mechanisms linking the genotype with gene expression.  previous studies have focused on associating eqtls with traits to identify the roles of trait-related eqtls and their corresponding target genes involved in trait determination.  expression quantitative trait loci (eqtl), or genetic variants associated with changes in gene expression, have the potential to assist in interpreting results of genome-wide association studies (gwas).  conditioned on a tissue, expression quantitative trait loci (eqtls) are genetic variants associated with gene expression, and egenes are genes whose expression levels are associated with genetic variants.  in this article we present a method for functional eqtl discovery and provide insights into relevance of noncoding variants for cell-specific gene regulation and for disease association beyond conventional eqtl mapping.  these eqtls provide insights into regulatory mechanisms underlying disease risk.  genome-wide association studies (gwas) have identified many variants, often in non-coding regions, with unknown functions and eqtl provide a possible mechanism by which these variants may influence observable phenotypes.  however, most genes are influenced by multiple eqtls which, thus, jointly affect any downstream phenotype.  expression quantitative trait loci (eqtls) have been found to be enriched in trait-associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (snps).  this approach allowed us to identify functionally important eqtls and show mechanisms that explain their cell-type restriction. ||| ",yes
Do circRNAs remain untranslated?,"selected circrnas were biochemically characterized, and we found that the majority of them lacks polyadenylation, is resistant to rnase r digestion and localized to the cytoplasm.  in recent years, a variety of circrnas have been found to have translational functions, and the resultant peptides also play biological roles in the emergence and progression of human disease.  the resulting circrna can be translated to generate functional proteins.  circular rnas (circrnas), a class of long-time-ignored noncoding rna, have been revealed as multifunctional rnas in recent years.  circular rnas (circrnas) are single-stranded rnas generated from exons back-splicing from a single pre-mrna, forming covalently closed loop structures which lack 5'-3'-polarity or polyadenylated tail.  circular rnas (circrnas) are crucial elements of non-coding rna, that regulate various biological processes.  this study extends our understanding of the molecular functions of plant circrnas.  circular rnas (circrnas) are categorized as non‑coding rnas that, unlike widely known canonical linear rnas, form a covalently closed continuous loop without 5' or 3' polarities, which enables them to resist digestion by rna exonucleases.  circular rnas (circrnas) are covalently closed rna loops produced by a very large number of expressed eukaryotic genes.  circular rnas (circrnas) are a group of covalently closed rnas, and their biological function is largely unknown.  circular rnas (circrnas) were recently discovered as a class of widely expressed noncoding rna and have been implicated in regulation of gene expression.  here we describe circrna research methods and biological functions, and discuss the potential relationship between circrnas and disease progression.  however, the function of the majority of circrnas remains unknown.  circular rnas (circrnas) is one kind of non-coding rnas (ncrnas) and exert crucial functions in biological processes and intracellular gene expression modulation.  circular rnas (circrnas) are noncoding rnas generated by back splicing.  circular rnas (circrnas) constitute a large class of rna species formed by the back-splicing of co-linear exons, often within protein-coding transcripts.  circular rnas (circrnas) have been considered a special class of non-coding rnas without 5' caps and 3' tails which are covalently closed rna molecules generated by back splicing of mrna.  circrnas have well-conserved sequences and often have high stability due to their resistance to exonucleases.  while the human transcriptome contains a large number of circular rnas (circrnas), the functions of most circrnas remain unclear.  for a long time, circrnas have been considered to be directly involved in various biological processes as functional rna. ||| ",no
Do conserved noncoding elements co-occur with matrix-attachment regions?,"matrix-attachment regions (mars) are dna elements that are defined by their abilities to bind to isolated nuclear matrices in vitro.  multi-species conserved non-coding elements occur in the vertebrate genome and are clustered in the vicinity of developmentally regulated genes.  it seems reasonable to assume that these conserved regions are more likely to contain functional elements than less-conserved portions of the genome.  dna is anchored to the nm by non-coding sequences known as matrix attachment regions (mars).  conserved noncoding elements (cnes) are elements exhibiting extreme noncoding conservation in metazoan genomes.  we have analyzed the dna sequences that are closest to the matrix attachment points for their relative content of specific repeated sequences.  scaffold or matrix attachment regions (s/mars) are noncoding genomic dna sequences displaying in vitro selective binding affinity for nuclear scaffold.  attachment regions of the eukaryotic chromosomal dna to the nuclear scaffold/matrix (s/mars) participate in various important cellular processes.  vertebrate genomes include gene regulatory elements in protein-noncoding regions.  in this work, we explore the utility of adding the notion of conserved core regions into a comparative genomics approach for the search for putative functional elements in noncoding dna.  these matrix association regions (mars) are adjacent, covering the first intron and part of the 5'-coding sequence.  we hypothesized that some of these regions might be matrix-scaffold attachment regions, mars (or s/mars).  scaffold/matrix-associated region (s/mar) sequences are dna regions that are attached to the nuclear matrix, and participate in many cellular processes.  the dna sequences of different matrix-binding elements vary widely.  there is a strong matrix-binding element approximately 16 kb upstream of alpha1at; three mars are between atr and cbg and one mar is within the cbg gene itself.  matrix attachment regions (mars) partition the genome into functional and structural loop-domains.  ninety noncoding sequences meeting these criteria were discovered, and the analysis of 15 of these elements found that about 70% were conserved across mammals.  although most verified functional elements in noncoding dna contain a highly conserved core region, this concept is not generally incorporated into de novo motif inference systems.  the nuclear matrix is a complex structure consisting of various elements.  spatial patterns of primary sequence conservation were also nonrandomly distributed within introns. ||| ",yes
Do histone variant mH2A (macro-H2A) levels decrease upon differentiation?,"macroh2a histone variants have functions in differentiation, somatic cell reprogramming and cancer.  macro (m)h2a is a histone variant that has two different subtypes in vertebrates: mh2a1 and mh2a2.  macroh2a (mh2a) is an unusual histone variant consisting of a histone h2a-like domain fused to a large nonhistone region.  the histone variant macroh2a (mh2a) has been implicated in transcriptional repression, but the molecular mechanisms that contribute to global mh2a-dependent genome regulation remain elusive.  we have previously shown that macro histone variants (macroh2a) are expressed at low levels in stem cells and are up-regulated during differentiation.  the unusual histone variant macroh2a (mh2a) has been associated with repression of transcription, but the molecular mechanisms by which it exerts this function are unknown.  our results indicate that the function of macroh2a1 histones is not restricted to gene silencing but also involves fine tuning the expression of specific genes.  the nonhistone region of mh2a is responsible for both the repression of initiation of transcription and the inhibition of histone acetylation.  macroh2a1 is a histone h2a variant which contains a large non-histone c-terminal region of largely unknown function.  differential expression of homomorphous variants of h2a family of histone h2a.1 and h2a.2 have been associated with hepatocellular carcinoma and maintenance of undifferentiated state of hepatocyte.  moreover, macroh2a1 isoforms differentially regulate the expression of lipogenic genes by modulating the association of the active (h3k4me3) and repressive (h3k27me3) histone marks on their promoters.  these data unambiguously identify mh2a as a strong transcriptional repressor and show that the repressive effect of mh2a is realized on at least two different transcription activation chromatin-dependent pathways: histone acetylation and nucleosome remodeling.  histone h2a has several variants, and changes in chromatin composition associated with their replacement might involve chromatin structure remodeling.  histone variant macroh2a1 has two splice isoforms, macroh2a1.1 and macroh2a1.2, with tissue- and cell-specific expression patterns.  these results suggest that global changes in the composition of histone h2a variants in chromatin play a role in genome remodeling after fertilization.  the histone variant macroh2a1 localizes to two functionally distinct chromatin subtypes marked by either h3k27me3 or h2b acetylations, where it is thought to directly regulate transcription.  the repressive effect of mh2a is observed at the level of initiation but not at elongation of transcription, and mh2a interferes with p300-dependent histone acetylation.  mouse and cell-based studies have shown that macroh2a histone variants predominantly associate with heterochromatin.  we examined the dynamics of the canonical histone h2a and its three variants, h2a.x, h2a.z and macroh2a, in the mouse during oogenesis and pre-implantation development when genome remodeling occurs.  we describe, for the first time, splice isoform-specific phenotypes for the histone variant macroh2a1 in a physiologic process and provide evidence for a novel underlying molecular mechanism of gene regulation. ||| ",no
Do lincRNAs play a role in human cancer?,"the mechanism of lincrnas in colorectal cancer (crc) has not been fully elucidated.  long intergenic noncoding rnas (lincrnas) play a vital role in the occurrence and progression of cancer.  lncrna linc01194 acts as an oncogene in several cancer types.  long non-coding rnas (lncrnas) have been demonstrated to mediate carcinogenesis in various types of cancer.  linc00052 is a newly identified lncrna involved in tumorigenesis.  in the current study, we assessed whether lncrna linc00858 may be involved in the progression of colon cancer and, in addition, investigated its downstream targets.  lncrnas are found to be aberrantly expressed in human cancers and could function as potential oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes.  long noncoding rnas (lncrnas) have been associated with many types of cancers, but their molecular mechanisms in lung squamous cell carcinoma (lusc) have not been fully studied.  the long noncoding rna (lncrna) linc00520 is an important modulator of the oncogenicity of multiple human cancers.  an increasing number of studies have shown that long noncoding rnas (lncrnas) are dysregulated in cancers, and participate in cancer initiation and progression.  long noncoding rnas (lncrnas) have been identified in multiple human cancer types, including lung cancer.  long noncoding rnas (lncrnas) have been indicated as important regulators in various human cancers.  we obtained 269 linc00265 related genes; the results of functional analysis of these genes revealed that linc00265 might involve in carcinogenesis of crc.  copious evidence reveals that long non-coding rnas (lncrnas) exert great regulatory functions in various human cancers.  long non-coding rnas (lncrnas) are known to be frequently dysregulated in many types of human cancer.  exogenous overexpression of linc00858 promoted cell proliferation, invasion and migration of colon cancer cells, and facilitated angiogenesis and tumor growth.  long-noncoding rnas (lncrnas) could exert a crucial effect on the development of human cancers, including crc.  linc01224 is a novel lncrna, identified as a cancer regulator of hcc.  lncrna linc01561 (linc01561) is a newly identified tumor-related lncrna and its dysregulation has been demonstrated in several tumors.  from our data we conclude that linc00858 acts as a tumor-promoting lncrna in colon cancer by upregulating hnf4α and downregulating wnk2. ||| ",yes
Do mutations of AKT1 occur in meningiomas?,"similar to prior reports, we identified akt1 and smo mutations in a subset of non-nf2-mutant meningiomas (ie, ∼9% and ∼6%, respectively).  akt1e17k mutations were exclusively seen in meningiomas and occurred in 65 of 958 of these tumors.  recent genomic research has identified oncogenic smo and akt1 mutations in a small subset of meningiomas.  we conclude that akt2 may play an important role in the development of meningioma.  identification of smo and akt1 mutations in meningiomas has raised the hope for targeted therapies.  identification of smo and akt1 mutations in meningiomas has raised the possibility of targeted therapies for some patients.  in this study, we examined the expression of akt2 in meningiomas and unveiled its possible relationship with the clinical outcome.  in recent years, several non-neurofibromin 2 mutations, i.e., akt1, smo, traf7, and klf4 mutations, specific for meningioma have been identified.  a hotspot mutation in the akt1 gene (akt1e17k ), which is found in meningiomas at the convexity and especially at the skull base, has been associated with earlier tumour recurrence.  meningiomas with an smo mutation presented with significantly larger tumor volume (70.6 ± 36.3 cm3) compared with akt1-mutated (18.2 ± 26.8 cm3) and wild-type (22.7 ± 23.9 cm3) meningiomas, respectively.  paraffin-embedded tissue from 108 meningioma patients was analysed for the presence of mutations in pik3ca and akt1.  western blots revealed activation of akt1 kinase (phosphorylation at ser273 and thr308) by the e17k mutation in human meningioma samples and in our in vitro and in vivo models.  recently several non-nf2 mutations in meningioma have been identified and correlated with certain pathological subtypes, locations and clinical observations.  methods the authors performed targeted sequencing in a large cohort of patients with anterior skull base meningiomas (n = 62) to better define the frequency of smo and akt1 mutations in these tumors.  meningiomas in the smo-mutant group had an overall 36% recurrence rate, significantly higher than in the akt1-mutant group (16%) and in the ""smo and akt1 wildtype"" group (11%) (χ2 test, p = .04).  out of the 79 patients with olfactory groove meningiomas, we identified targetable mutations in 34 patients (43%) (22 patients  with smo mutation-l412f almost exclusively-and 12 patients  with akt1 mutation).  genotyping of smo and akt1 is likely to be high yield in anterior skull base meningiomas with available surgical tissue.  our data suggest that akt1e17k mutated meningiomas are a promising selective target for azd5363.  the expression of akt2 and ki-67 in meningioma tissues were evaluated immunohistochemically in 94 patients with meningiomas.  we used high-resolution array-comparative genomic hybridization to prospectively characterize copy-number changes in 150 meningiomas and then characterized these samples for mutations in akt1, klf4, nf2, pik3ca, smo, and traf7. ||| ",yes
Do normal cells express the protein TERT?,"in normal tissues, tert is expressed in stem cells and in progenitor cells, but its role in these compartments is not fully understood.  eighteen of the 63 cases were examined for tert mrna and the correlation with expression of tert protein was investigated.  tert has been shown to act as a key factor in various biological processes, such as cell proliferation, via uncharacterized mechanisms.  it was reported recently that tert is expressed in neurons throughout the brain in embryonic and early postnatal development, but is absent from neurons in the adult brain.  we evaluated the relationship between the analyzed tert genomic abnormalities and protein expression; however, no apparent relationship was observed.  tert protein levels are reduced with age, whereas in the nucleus tert activity is increased.  immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated tert expression in 31% of aitl, 11% of ptcl-nos, and 5% of atll.  tert, the protein component of telomerase, serves to maintain telomere function through the de novo addition of telomere repeats to chromosome ends, and is reactivated in 90% of human cancers.  in this study, the expression of tert was investigated by immunocytochemistry to determine whether it is a useful marker for differential diagnosis in benign or malignant breast tumors.  cases with mutation, detectable mrna expression, cn gain or hypermethylation were classified as tert aberrant, and these aberrancies were regularly found in ftc and ft-ump but uncommonly found in fta.  in conclusion, the expression of tert protein might be a useful marker for differential diagnosis in malignant and benign breast tumors.  telomerase reverse transcriptase (tert) is the protein component of telomerase complex.  tert is the main functional unit of telomerase, which maintains telomere length and chromosome structure stability.  however, terc is also ubiquitously expressed in most human terminally differentiated cells, which don't have telomerase activity.  terc is an rna component of telomerase.  it was found that tert and c-myc expression was observed mostly in malignancies and expression of c-myc was concordant for positivity and negativity with tert.  furthermore, immunostaining showed tert expression in the ptcl cytoplasm, suggesting the existence of mechanisms other than the maintenance of telomere length.  the function of terc in these cells is largely unknown.  statistical analysis of the effect of tert expression on the prognosis in ptcl cases revealed that tert expression tended to have a poor prognosis in ptcl-nos.  it was predicted that tert might play nontelomeric roles in the generation or development of some rare diseases, such as rift valley fever and dyscalculia. ||| ",no
Do orphan and gene related CpG islands follow power-law-like distributions?,"cpg islands, which have higher gc content and cpg frequencies compared to the genome as a whole, are generally believed to be unmethylated in tissues except at promoters of genes undergoing x chromosome inactivation or genomic imprinting.  to know the probability of association of noti sites with cpg rich islands, we screened 5,188 sequences accumulated in dna data base for the presence of noti site and examined the distribution of cpgs around them.  regions with abundant gc nucleotides, a high cpg number, and a length greater than 200 bp in a genome are often referred to as cpg islands.  we show that the widths of the c--g distributions for the genes of several simple organisms also vary as power laws.  recently, several algorithms for the prediction of cpg islands have been proposed.  using our previous result that the c--g distribution in genomes is very broad, varying as a power law of the size of the block of genome considered, we examine the c--g distribution in genes themselves.  it has been envisaged that cpg islands are often observed near the transcriptional start sites (tss) of housekeeping genes.  cpg islands are discrete regions of dna with significantly greater frequencies of cpg doublets than bulk genomic dna.  the sizes of paralogues-gene families produced by ancestral duplication-are known to follow a power-law distribution.  these overall distributions of well-developed islands can be related to the major transitions of the cg-rich genomes of warm-blooded vertebrates from the cg-poor ones of other animals.  this suggests that the power law behavior gives a universal scaling whereby the distributions for the c--g content of the genes from all species are mapped onto a single function.  recent studies, however, have shown that cpg islands at promoters of a number of genes contain tissue-dependent, differentially methylated regions (t-dmrs).  using thousands of sequences with known tss in human and mouse, we found that there is a clear peak in the distribution of cpg islands around tss in the genes of these two species.  this frequency is consistent well with the prediction that 89% of noti sites in mammalian genome are likely to be present in cpg rich islands and would stress the importance of cloning of noti linking sequences for direct isolation of desired genes.  a higher number of cpg islands were identified in chromosomes 21 and 22 of the human genome than with the other methods from the literature.  then, the tendency that a gene lacking cpg islands around its tss is expressed with a higher degree of tissue specificity turned out to be evolutionarily conserved.  unusually, these t-dmrs involve the whole cpg island at each of these loci.  these evaluations relied on a gene tree for the entire myc family to test the origins of cpg islands within their two protein-coding exons.  the scale invariant poisson-gamma (pg) distribution is the most applicable of these models, since it describes the above findings and it lends itself to a stochastic mechanism for the accumulation of segmental chromosomal changes.  we propose here a new method called cpsorl to predict cpg islands, which consists of a complement particle swarm optimization algorithm combined with reinforcement learning to predict cpg islands more reliably. ||| ",yes
Do patients with Pendred syndrome present congenital deafness?,"pendred syndrome is a common autosomal recessive disorder causing deafness.  pendred syndrome is one of the most common hereditary determined diseases in patients with syndromic sensorineural hearing impairment.  their father had recessively inherited deafness associated with dilated vestibular aqueducts and a clinical diagnosis of pendred's syndrome was made in him, which was confirmed molecularly.  pendred syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by congenital sensorineural deafness, goitre and defective iodide organification.  pendred syndrome is an autosomal recessive condition classically characterized by deafness and goitre.  pendred syndrome (pds) is characterized by profound deafness in childhood, positive perchlorate challenge, and goiter.  pendred syndrome comprises the association of severe congenital sensorineural deafness with thyroid pathology.  pendred syndrome (ps), a recessive disorder caused by mutations in the slc26a4 (pds) gene, is associated with deafness and goiter.  pendred syndrome is the autosomal recessively transmitted association of familial goiter and congenital deafness.  pendred syndrome, characterized by congenital sensorineural hearing loss and goiter, is one of the most common forms of syndromic deafness.  inherited as an autosomal recessive trait, pendred syndrome is a disease that shows congenital sensorineural hearing loss and goiter, with a positive finding in the perchlorate discharge test.  pendred syndrome is the most common form of syndromic deafness, characterized by dyshormonogenic goiter associated with sensory-neural deafness.  we report two cases in which the probands presented with deafness and a family history of a dominantly inherited auditory pigmentary syndrome, yet the cause of deafness in each proband was not associated with the pigmentary abnormalities but was a result of mutations in slc26a4, the gene mutated in pendred's syndrome.  pendred's syndrome is an association between congenital neurosensory deafness and goitre with abnormal discharge of iodide following perchlorate challenge, indicating a defect of iodide organification.  mutations in the slc26a4 gene, which encodes pendrin, cause congenital hearing loss as a manifestation of pendred syndrome (ps) with an iodide organification defect or nonsyndromic enlarged vestibular aqueduct (nseva, dfnb4).  pendred syndrome and non-syndromic recessive deafness associated with enlarged vestibular aqueduct (nsrd with eva) are caused by mutations in the slc26a4 (pds) gene.  pendred syndrome, characterized by childhood deafness and postpuberty goiter, is caused by mutations of slc26a4, which codes for the anion exchanger pendrin.  although pendred's syndrome may cause up to 7.5% of all cases of congenital deafness, the molecular basis of the association between the hearing loss and the thyroid organification defect remains unknown.  mutations in the slc26a4 gene are associated with pendred syndrome and autosomal recessive non-syndromic deafness (dfnb4).  individuals were assigned affected status based on the characteristic clinical features of pendred's syndrome, namely the presence of congenital sensorineural hearing loss and the appearance in early life of a goitre. ||| ",yes
Do plant genomes contain CpG islands?,"we screened plant genome sequences, primarily from rice and arabidopsis thaliana, for cpg islands, and identified dna segments rich in cpg dinucleotides within these sequences.  cpg islands mark cpg-enriched regions in otherwise cpg-depleted vertebrate genomes.  in this study, we performed a systematic analysis of cpg islands in ten mammalian genomes.  our study revealed that cpg islands vary greatly among mammalian genomes.  together, these findings indicate that functionally relevant variations of cpg islands exist.  cpg islands, which are clusters of cpg dinucleotides in gc-rich regions, are considered gene markers and represent an important feature of mammalian genomes.  cpg islands (cgis) are cpg-rich regions compared to cpg-depleted bulk dna of mammalian genomes and are generally regarded as the epigenetic regulatory regions in association with unmethylation, promoter activity and histone modifications.  it has been envisaged that cpg islands are often observed near the transcriptional start sites (tss) of housekeeping genes.  accurate identification of cpg islands with epigenetic regulatory function in bulk genomes is of wide interest.  our results show that prevention of methylation is an intrinsic property of cpg islands, recognized even if a human cpg island is transferred to a plant genome.  these plant cpg-rich clusters satisfied the criteria used for identifying human cpg islands, which suggests that these cpg clusters may be regarded as plant cpg islands.  for example, cpg islands in the human genome vary ∼30-fold in their lengths.  in the vertebrate genomes studied to date the 5' end of many genes are associated with distinctive sequences known as cpg islands.  regions with abundant gc nucleotides, a high cpg number, and a length greater than 200 bp in a genome are often referred to as cpg islands.  we found that both the number of cpg islands and their density vary greatly among genomes, though many of these genomes encode similar numbers of genes.  cpg islands, which have higher gc content and cpg frequencies compared to the genome as a whole, are generally believed to be unmethylated in tissues except at promoters of genes undergoing x chromosome inactivation or genomic imprinting.  cpg islands are discrete regions of dna with significantly greater frequencies of cpg doublets than bulk genomic dna.  a higher number of cpg islands were identified in chromosomes 21 and 22 of the human genome than with the other methods from the literature.  the position of a plant cpg island within its associated gene appeared to be related to the extent of tissue-specific expression of the gene; the cpg islands of most of the widely expressed rice genes occurred near the 5'-end of the genes.  a large proportion of the genes belonged to one of two classes, in which a cpg island occurred near the 5'-end of the gene or covered the whole gene region. ||| ",yes
Do proton pump inhibitors affect thyroxine absorption?,"to examine retrospectively the effect of proton pump inhibitors (ppis) on thyrotropin (thyroid-stimulating hormone or tsh) values in patients with hypothyroidism and normal tsh levels receiving levothyroxine (lt4) replacement therapy.  an increased need for thyroxine has also been observed in gastric disorders due to variations in drug dissolution and/or in its ionization status.  in rare instances, drugs or diseases affecting absorption of thyroxine or drugs that accelerate thyroxine metabolism can manifest in a similar fashion.  we studied the effects of three medications on thyroxine absorption in seven normal volunteers.  the aim of this study was to assess the effect of concomitant use of levothyroxine (lt4) and proton pump inhibitors (ppis) on thyroid-stimulating hormone (tsh) levels in patients with primary hypothyroidism.  amiodarone and propranolol have been known to inhibit the peripheral conversion of thyroxine (t4) to 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (t3) but their direct effect on the thyroid gland is not understood.  background: thyroxine absorption takes place at the small intestine level and several disorders affecting this intestinal tract lead to thyroxine malabsorption.  it is believed that gastric ph interferes in levothyroxine absorption.  to determine if propylthiouracil (ptu) inhibited extrathyroidal thyroxine (t4) to triiodothyronine (t3) conversion in man, ptu was administered to t4-treated hypothyroid patients and serial measurements of t4, t3, and thyrotropin (tsh) carried out.  serum thyroxine was measured at intervals over a 6-hour period following drug ingestion.  propylthiouracil (ptu) and methimazole (mmi) are the most commonly used antithyroid drugs.  in phase 2, the eight patients who received cholestyramine showed an additional decline in free thyroxine from weeks one to two, but the overall rate of decline in hormone levels was not different between the groups.  we conclude from both our in vitro and our in vivo studies that ptu and methylmercaptoimidazole have no inhibitory effect on thyroglobulin synthesis in rat thyroids and that such inhibition does not play a significant role in the antithyroid action of these drugs.  the available data suggest that these drugs may block the thyroid hormone synthesis by inhibiting the thyroid peroxidase (tpo) or diverting oxidized iodides away from thyroglobulin.  conclusions: in almost all hypothyroid patients with uc, the therapeutic dose of thyroxine is increased.  in 15 patients the serum thyroxine level fell low enough to raise the serum thyrotrophin; in all 15 the serum thyrotrophin rose when taking synthroid.  sevelamer hydrochloride and chromium picolinate each significantly (p < 0.05) decreased the area under the serum thyroxine concentration curve, while ezetimibe had no effect.  experiments were performed both in vivo and in vitro to test a previous proposal that part of the antithyroid action of the thioureylene drugs, propylthiouracil (ptu) and methylmercaptoimidazole, can be attributed to inhibition of thyroglobulin (tg) biosynthesis.  thus, the decreased bioavailability (lower serum thyroxine) and decreased biologic action (higher serum thyrotrophin) of synthroid were due to the lower content of thyroxine.  medications may sometimes interfere with the intestinal absorption of levothyroxine, primarily by forming an insoluble complex with the thyroid hormone in the intestinal lumen. ||| ",yes
Do selenoproteins and selenium play a role in prostate cancer prevention?,"daily supplementation with the essential trace mineral selenium significantly reduced prostate cancer risk in men in the nutritional prevention of cancer trial.  we evaluated the association between serum selenium status and prostate cancer risk in a population with relative low selenium concentrations considering effect modification by genetic variants in selenoprotein genes.  relationships among the genotype of selenoproteins implicated in increased cancer risk, selenium status, and race with prostate cancer were investigated.  increased dietary intake of selenium (se) has been suggested to lower prostate cancer mortality, but supplementation trials have produced conflicting results.  greater prediagnostic serum selenium concentrations were not associated with prostate cancer risk in this large cohort, although greater concentrations were associated with reduced prostate cancer risks in men who reported a high intake of vitamin e, in multivitamin users, and in smokers.  selenium status is inversely associated with the incidence of prostate cancer.  selenium compounds have known chemopreventive effects on prostate cancer.  the dietary trace element selenium has been proposed to be a potential chemopreventive agent for prostate cancer.  we examined associations between plasma selenium, genotypes, and risk of high-grade prostate cancer (gleason grade ≥8 or 7 with primary score ≥4; n = 111) using logistic regression, and risk of prostate cancer recurrence (61 events; 3.8 y median follow-up) using cox proportional hazards regression.  overall, serum selenium was not associated with prostate cancer risk (p for trend = 0.70); however, higher serum selenium was associated with lower risks in men reporting a high (more than the median: 28.0 iu/d) vitamin e intake  and in multivitamin users (or for highest compared with the lowest quartile of selenium: 0.61; 95% ci: 0.36, 1.04; p for trend = 0.06; p for interaction = 0.05).  epidemiological and clinical data suggest that selenium may prevent prostate cancer, but the biological effects of selenium on normal or malignant prostate cells are not well known.  the role of selenium in prostate cancer (pca) risk remains controversial, but many epidemiologic studies suggest an inverse association with more aggressive disease.  epidemiologic studies and secondary analyses of randomized trials supported the hypothesis that selenium and vitamin e lower prostate cancer risk.  the aims were to investigate the association between serum selenium and prostate cancer risk and to examine interactions with other antioxidants and tobacco use.  serum selenium level (s-se) has been associated with prostate cancer (prca) risk.  the aim of this work was to assess whether risk of prostate cancer is affected by genetic variants in genes coding for selenoproteins, either alone or in combination with se status.  furthermore, among smokers, high serum selenium concentrations were related to reduced prostate cancer risk (or for the highest compared with the lowest quartile of selenium: 0.65; 95% ci: 0.44, 0.97; p for trend = 0.09; p for interaction = 0.007).  our results support a role of selenium and polymorphisms in selenoenzymes in prostate cancer etiology, which warrants confirmation in future studies.  thus, we examined plasma selenium and selenium-related genes in relation to risk of high-grade prostate cancer and prostate cancer recurrence among men initially diagnosed with non-metastatic disease.  epidemiological studies and clinical trials show that selenium supplementation results in reduction of prostate cancer incidence; however, the form of selenium and mechanisms underlying protection remain largely unknown. ||| ",no
Do statins cause diabetes?,"background: previously conducted studies with statins shows an increased risk of developing new onset of diabetes.  statins may accelerate progression to diabetes via molecular mechanisms that impact insulin sensitivity and secretion.  increasing evidence suggests that statins might increase the risk of new-onset diabetes; however, diabetes is known to increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases.  however, patients prescribed statins have a higher background risk of diabetes.  this study helps in analyzing the risk of statins to cause new onset of diabetes.objective: to assess the prevalence, causality, severity, preventability and risk factors of statin-induced new onset of diabetes in dyslipidemic patients.methods: the study was conducted in a tertiary care hospital.  risk of diabetes was increased after statins, but outcomes were favorable.  in those predisposed to the development of diabetes (the insulin resistant, obese and older patients) statins may increase the risk of developing diabetes.  there is growing evidence to suggest that statin therapy is associated with an increased risk of incident diabetes.  however, statins are associated with excessive risk of diabetes occurrence according to clinical trial analyses.  our study indicated an association between statin use and an increased risk of new-onset diabetes mellitus.  statin use was associated with greater diabetes risk irrespective of treatment group, with pooled hr (95% ci) for incident diabetes of 1.36 (1.17 to 1.58).  the diabetogenic action of statins remains a concern, particularly in patients at high risk for diabetes receiving intensive statin therapy.  recent evidence, however, suggests that statins can increase the risk of new-onset diabetes (nod).  recent studies suggest that statins increase the risk of new-onset diabetes mellitus (nodm).  the effect of statins to increase diabetes risk appears to extend to populations at high risk for diabetes.  we aimed to assess whether statin use increases the risk of developing diabetes or affects overall mortality among normoglycemic patients and patients with impaired fasting glucose (ifg).  patients who developed statin-induced new onset of diabetes were managed by dose reduction and treatment with anti-diabetic medications.conclusion the prevalence of statin-induced new onset of diabetes is 7.03%.  recent studies suggest that statins increase the risk of subsequent diabetes with a clear dose response effect.  these findings further support the link between statin use and new-onset diabetes and suggest that the understanding of diabetes risk associated with different antihypertensive drug classes may bear practice modification.  the increased risk of new-onset diabetes with statin use, including high-potency statins, is well known. ||| ",yes
Do thyroid hormone receptors change after brain injury?,"thyroid hormone plays an important role in brain development and adult brain function, and may influence neuronal recovery after traumatic brain injury (tbi).  the findings from both in vitro and in vivo studies support a role of thyroid hormone in activating pathways important for neuronal protection and promotion of neuronal recovery after injury.  cognitive and affective functioning is sensitive to changes in thyroid hormones.  expression of genes important for thyroid hormone action in the brain, mct8 and type 2 deiodinase (dio2) mrna, diminished after injury, but were partially restored with t4 treatment.  thyroid hormones (th) and receptors (trs) may play an important role in the pathophysiology of acute cerebral ischemia.  the quantitation of thyroid hormone levels in cerebrocortical synaptosomes of the adult rat at altered thyroid states was studied because of the recent idea of the involvement of thyroid hormone in the adult mammalian brain.  patients with hyperthyroidism frequently present with regional cerebral metabolic changes, but the consequences of endocrine-induced brain changes after thyroid function normalization are unclear.  we utilized both animal and cell culture models to determine the effects of thyroid hormone treatment, post tbi or during hypoxia, on genes important for neuronal survival and neurogenesis.  however, little is known about the influence of thyroid hormones on brain perfusion and the relationship of such perfusion changes with cognition.  in the present study, we sought to determine whether serum triodothyronine (t3)/thyroxine (t4) and brain trs (trα1, trβ1) might change after experimental stroke.  cognitive impairments have been found in thyroid hormone-related diseases (e.g.  we hypothesized that the changes of regional cerebral glucose metabolism are related to thyroid hormone levels in patients with hyperthyroid, and some of these changes can be reversed with antithyroid therapy.  the changes of regional cerebral glucose metabolism are related to thyroid hormone levels in patients with hyperthyroidism, and some cerebral hypometabolism can be improved after antithyroid therapy.  the present investigation indicates a tendency for synaptosomal reorientation of t3 level for vital neurophysiologic function in altered thyroid conditions.  thyroid hormones (th) were hypothesized to affect behavior via neurotransmission alterations.  the current study is an investigation of alterations in regional cerebral blood flow (rcbf) distribution in patients with transient hypothyroidism after thyroidectomy.  compared with the hyperthyroid status, patients with normalized thyroid functions showed an increased metabolism in the left parahippocampal, fusiform, and right superior frontal gyri.  a major change in thyroid setpoint regulation occurs in various clinical conditions such as critical illness and psychiatric disorders.  99mtc-hmpao spect and spm96 analysis demonstrated a significant rcbf decrease in the parietal lobe and part of the occipital lobe in patients with induced transient hypothyroidism after thyroidectomy.  a single dose of levothyroxine (t4), one hour after injury, increased serum t4 and normalized serum t3 levels. ||| ",yes
Does  thyroid hormone receptor beta1 affect insulin secretion?,"on account of our results, we might suggest that insulin secretion is regulated, at least in part, by the circulating levels of thyroid hormones.  the effect of thyroid hormone deprivation upon insulin secretion was studied in the rat, in relation to glucose oxidation, calcium uptake, insulin content and morphology of pancreatic islets.  thyroid hormones modulate the immune system and metabolism, influence insulin secretion, and cause decreased glucose tolerance.  strong experimental evidence suggests that thyroid hormones influence beta-adrenoceptor regulation.  the aim of our present study was to analyze how glucose and insulin affect trh secretion by the pancreatic islets.  insulin-secreting pancreatic beta cells also express thyrotropin-releasing hormone (trh).  the actions of thyroid hormone (th) on pancreatic beta cells have not been thoroughly explored, with current knowledge being limited to the modulation of insulin secretion in response to glucose, and beta cell viability by regulation of pro-mitotic and pro-apoptotic factors.  the deficit in circulating thyroid hormone levels was followed by a smaller glucose-induced insulin secretion, glucose oxidation rate and calcium uptake.  thyroid hormones have been described to change the incidence of spontaneous autoimmune thyroiditis in bio-breeding/worcester (bb) rats but it is unknown how these hormones affect the development of type 1 diabetes mellitus (t1dm).  the effect of thyroid hormone excess on glucose tolerance as well as insulin secretion and its peripheral action has been a matter of debate for many years.  in this study, we investigated serum serum insulin levels and their correlations with thyroid-stimulating hormone (tsh), free thyroxine (ft4) and free triiodothyronine (ft3) in hypothyroid women.  hypothyroidism has been associated with disorders of glucose and insulin metabolism involving defective insulin secretion in response to glucose, hyperinsulinemia, altered peripheral glucose disposal and insulin resistance.  among the peripheral effects of thyroid hormone action, their influence on insulin is of great interest and conflicting data on this subject are available.  the aim of the study was to investigate the impact of hyperthyroidism on the characteristics of the islet insulin secretory response to glucose, particularly the consequences of competition between thyroid hormone and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (ppar)alpha in the regulation of islet adaptations to starvation and dietary lipid-induced insulin resistance.  the effect of thyroid status on insulin sensitivity is of great interest but despite various studies there is conflicting data on this subject.  thyrotropin-releasing hormone (trh), originally isolated as a hypothalamic hormone, has been reported to be present and released from the pancreatic beta cells, affecting pancreatic functions.  the impact of levothyroxine on thyroid antibody titres correlated with baseline and treatment-induced changes in homa1-ir, thyrotropin, hscrp and 25-hydroxyvitamin d. the results of the current study suggest that the impact of exogenous levothyroxine on thyroid autoimmunity and hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis activity is determined by insulin sensitivity.  the precise mechanism underlying the effect of thyroid hormone excess on insulin sensitivity remains to be elucidated.  the purpose of the current study was to investigate whether insulin sensitivity determines levothyroxine action on thyroid antibody titres and hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis activity in young women with autoimmune subclinical hypothyroidism.  these data suggest insulin acts on β-cells in an endocrine manner in the normal situation; and that in β-cells lacking insulin receptors, insulin and glucose minimally activate the akt pathway, while erk phosphorylation and foxo1 nuclear export occur independently of insulin signaling. ||| ",no
Does Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) have anti-inflammatory activity?,"apolipoprotein e (apoe) exerts potent antiinflammatory effects.  apolipoprotein e (apoe) exerts anti-inflammatory properties that protect against atherosclerosis and other inflammatory diseases.  apolipoprotein e (apoe) exerts prominent anti-inflammatory effects and undergoes recycling by target cells.  apolipoprotein e (apoe) has been detected to possess anti-inflammatory properties that can contribute to protection against experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (eae).  apolipoprotein e (apoe) has been implicated in modulating the central nervous system (cns) inflammatory response.  apolipoprotein e (apoe), well known to play a role in lipid transport and cholesterol metabolism, also exerts anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects in the central nervous system.  apolipoprotein e (apoe) has been shown to play a pivotal role in the development of cardiovascular disease, attributable to its function in lipid trafficking and immune modulating properties; however, its role in modulating inflammation in the setting of acute lung injury (ali) is unknown.  the apolipoprotein e (apo e) plays an important role in the lipoprotein metabolism and has been linked to inflammatory disease such as atherosclerosis and alzheimer disease.  the anti-atherogenic properties of human apoprotein e-associated lipoproteins have been partially attributed to its anti-inflammatory properties.  apolipoprotein e (apoe), an antiatherogenic apolipoprotein, plays a significant role in the metabolism of lipoproteins.  apolipoprotein e (apoe) exerts antiatherogenic effects but precise mechanisms remain unclear.  we show that apoe modulates the systemic type i inflammatory response in vivo.  previous data suggest that apoe also has antiinflammatory properties that may contribute to protection against atherosclerosis independent of its role in lipid metabolism.  apolipoprotein e (apoe) is synthesized in the liver and in macrophages, and it has antiatherogenic properties that are mediated, at least in part, through the regulation of plasma cholesterol homeostasis.  apolipoprotein e (apoe) mediates cellular cholesterol efflux and plays a crucial role in the inhibition of atherogenesis.  apolipoprotein (apo) e stands out among plasma apolipoproteins through its unprecedented ability to protect against atherosclerosis.  apolipoprotein e (apoe) is a 299 amino acid protein with multiple biological functions.  to test the hypothesis that apoe suppresses inflammation and atherosclerosis by regulating cellular microrna levels in these leukocytes.  this antiinflammatory effect represents a novel antiatherogenic activity of apoe.  we studied if endogenously expressed apoprotein e (apoe) elicits isoform-dependent effects on pro-inflammatory cytokine expression and secretion. ||| ",yes
Does BNP increase after intensive exercise in athletes?,"the aim of this study was to determine the effect of maximal physical activity on plasma bnp concentrations in healthy individuals within 3 hours after the short-term exercise.  based on the studies in normal subjects indicating that pro-bnp levels changes after exercise, we hypothesized that the pro-bnp might rise after the 6mwt in pah patients, potentially impacting clinical decisions.  bnp was elevated in marathoners, immediately after the race and also after 4 h. we studied the behavior of bnp in the triathlon, which is a complex sport characterized by 3 different activities (swimming, cycling, running).  the increase of bnp concentrations immediately after exercise was statistically significant (p=0.0017) compared to baseline values.  many studies have demonstrated a rise in troponin and brain natriuretic peptide (bnp) levels following prolonged and/or strenuous exercise.  exercise increased plasma anp and bnp in the two groups.  plasma nt-pro-bnp levels were measured at rest and immediately after exercise.  there appears to be a trend of pro-bnp level increasing immediately after exercise and continuing to be elevated at 1 h. pro-bnp levels then return to baseline at 2 h post 6mwt.  in 22 patients (22%) an increase in bnp ≥35pg/ml after the exercise test was observed.  we compared exercise-induced increases in bnp between healthy controls (con) and individuals with cvrf or cvd.  exercise is associated with changes in circulating b-type natriuretic peptide (bnp) and n-terminal-probnp (nt-probnp).  we sought to assess determinants of absolute (δ) and relative (δ%) exercise-induced changes in bnp and nt-probnp.  bnp (n = 418) and nt-probnp (n = 478) at rest and peak exercise were measured in patients undergoing symptom-limited cycle ergometer tests.  thus exercise increases plasma levels of bnp, and impaired left ventricular function may be a main factor in the greater increment in bnp during exercise in patients with congestive heart failure.  healthy athletes demonstrated increased b-type natriuretic peptide (bnp) concentrations following exercise, but it is unknown whether these responses are exaggerated in individuals with cardiovascular risk factors (cvrf) or disease (cvd).  plasma pro-bnp (brain natriuretic peptide) levels are often elevated in response to right ventricular (rv) volume and pressure overload, parameters potentially affected by exercise.  the aim of the study is to determine the factors that cause the release of bnp during the exercise test.  in conclusion, short-term maximal physical exercise in healthy individuals led to a fast and transient rise of plasma bnp concentrations, which remained well within normal range and far below the cut-off value for heart failure (100 pg/ml).  serum bnp concentrations were measured in 191 participants (60±12yrs) of the nijmegen marches before (baseline) and immediately after 4 consecutive days of walking exercise (30-50km/day).  to investigate if the exercise-induced immune response contributes to the exercise-induced increase in brain natriuretic peptide (bnp) in healthy athletes. ||| ",yes
Does CRISPR inversion of CTCF sites alter genome topology?,"inversion of cbs elements within the pcdh enhancer reconfigures the topology of chromatin loops between the distal enhancer and target promoters and alters gene-expression patterns.  recent studies identified a correlation between the orientation of ctcf-binding sites (cbss) and chromatin loops.  however, crispr rna is reported to bind to other genomic locations that differ from the intended target site by a few nucleotides, demonstrating significant off-target activity.  using crispr dna-fragment editing, in conjunction with chromosome conformation capture, we find that ctcf sites, if located between enhancers and promoters in the protocadherin (pcdh) and β-globin clusters, function as an enhancer-blocking insulator by forming distinct directional chromatin loops, regardless whether enhancers contain ctcf sites or not.  our analysis demonstrates the importance of structural rearrangements in mediating the effect of crispr-cas9-induced dna damage, with implications for the use of crispr-cas9 gene-editing in cancer cells.  structural rearrangements are a ubiquitous feature of cancer cells and their impact on the functional consequences of crispr-cas9 gene-editing has not yet been assessed.  utilizing crispr-cas9 knockout screens for 250 cancer cell lines, we demonstrate that targeting structurally rearranged regions, in particular tandem or interspersed amplifications, is highly detrimental to cellular fitness in a gene-independent manner.  to test the functional significance of this observation, we combined crispr/cas9-based genomic-dna-fragment editing with chromosome-conformation-capture experiments to show that the location and relative orientations of cbss determine the specificity of long-range chromatin looping in mammalian genomes, using protocadherin (pcdh) and β-globin as model genes.  the recently discovered clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (crispr)-cpf1 system expands the genome editing toolbox.  a recent publication in cell helps resolve this paradox by revealing crispr-array-independent mechanisms of chromosomal homing unique to different cast types.  crispr-dt will empower researchers in genome editing.  the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (crispr)-cpf1 system has been successfully applied in genome editing.  crispr-associated tn7 transposons (casts) co-opt cas genes for rna-guided transposition.  to carry out target site-specific genome editing, we released the crisprdirect ( http://crispr.dbcls.jp /) website.  furthermore, ctcf insulators promote, counter-intuitively, long-range chromatin interactions with distal directional ctcf sites, consistent with the cohesin ""loop extrusion"" model.  here, we exploited crispr interference and programmable base editing to determine their potential in editing a tert gene promoter-activating mutation, which occurs in many diverse cancer types, particularly glioblastoma5-8.  clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (crispr)-cas9 technology allows the modification of dna sequences in vivo at the location of interest.  thus, although enhancers can function in an orientation-independent manner in reporter assays, in the native chromosome context, the orientation of at least some enhancers carrying cbss can determine both the architecture of topological chromatin domains and enhancer/promoter specificity.  finally, gene expression levels are negatively correlated with ctcf insulators located between enhancers and promoters on a genome-wide scale.  in this study, we reanalyzed the published crispr-cpf1 grnas data and found many sequence and structural features related to their target efficiency. ||| ",yes

Does DDX54 play a role in DNA damage response?,"we aimed to investigate whether ddx3x plays a direct role in the dna damage response in live cells.  in vitro analysis of nuclear ddx3x interactions and localization with dna damage pointed to a direct role for ddx3x in the dna damage response.  we found that ddx3x accumulates at sites of microirradiation shortly after dna damage induction.  ddx52 knockdown repressed the growth of pca cells in vitro and in vivo.  we further found ddx3x recruitment to be mediated by its intrinsically disordered domains, similar to other rna binding proteins that are recruited to sites of dna damage.  in vitro and in vivo experiments showed that downregulating ddx52 impeded the growth of pca cells.  ddx52 expression was upregulated in pca tissues.  human damaged dna-binding protein (ddb) is a heterodimer of p48/ddb2 and p127/ddb1 subunits.  the quantitative analysis of uv-induced dna lesions indicated that the dark repair of dna damage was accelerated in ddi2 overexpression lines but delayed in knockdown lines.  the inhibition of ddx52 via rna interference with shrna was used to clarify the effects of ddx52 on pca cell growth in vitro and in vivo.  ddx52 was overexpressed in pca tissues in contrast to normal prostate tissues.  however, recent studies indicated additional functions of ddb2 in the dna damage response pathway.  bioinformatics analysis showed that the level of ddx52 further increased in advanced pca, with a high ddx52 level indicating a poor outcome.  damage-specific dna-binding (ddb) protein heterodimer has been extensively studied in the context of nucleotide excision repair.  recent studies have suggested that human rna helicase, ddx3x, is important for dna repair, but little is known about the nuclear activity of this protein.  the damaged dna-binding protein (ddb) is believed to be involved in dna repair, and it has been linked to the repair deficiency disease xeroderma pigmentosum.  ddb is believed to play a role in the initial step of damage recognition in mammalian nucleotide excision repair (ner) of ultraviolet light (uv)-induced photolesions.  the observations suggest that, in addition to dna repair, the other interactions of ddb2 are significant in its tumor suppression function.  we determined ddx52 protein levels in pca tissues using immunohistochemistry (ihc).  high ddx52 levels contributed to activating c-myc signaling in pca patients and pca cells. ||| ",yes
Does Enzastaurin improve survival of glioblastoma patients?,"enzastaurin has anti-glioma activity in patients with recurrent high-grade glioma, but does not appear to have enough single-agent activity to be useful as monotherapy.  enzastaurin, a potent inhibitor of protein kinase c-beta, inhibits angiogenesis and has direct cytotoxic activity against glioma cells in preclinical studies.  enzastaurin is emerging as a promising new antitumor treatment.  this study was designed to determine if maintenance enzastaurin improved the outcome of whole brain radiotherapy (wbrt) in lung cancer (lc) patients with brain metastases (bms).  this study's primary objective was evaluation of the progression-free survival rate at 6 months (pfs-6) in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma without o(6)-methylguanine-dna-methyltransferase (mgmt) promoter hypermethylation postsurgically treated with enzastaurin before and concomitantly with radiation therapy, followed by enzastaurin maintenance therapy.  enzastaurin is a protein kinase c inhibitor with anti-tumor activity.  several preliminary studies showed promising results in patients with various advanced cancers and suggested that enzastaurin can be safely used long term in combination with traditional chemotherapies.  enzastaurin - a novel oral antitumor agent that selectively inhibits protein kinase cbeta activity - has demonstrated promise in phase i and ii trials in various advanced cancers, and is being investigated in multiple hematologic malignancies and solid tumors.  enzastaurin (ly317615.hcl) is an oral selective pkc-beta inhibitor with antiproliferative efficacy in various tumor models.  patients were treated with enzastaurin prior to, concomitantly with, and after standard partial brain radiotherapy.  enzastaurin was evaluated alone and in combination with the egfr inhibitor gefitinib, on growth and signalling protein expression in human cancer cells sensitive and resistant to anti-egfr drugs, both in vitro and in nude mice.  remarkably, these results were confirmed in vivo, where enzastaurin showed antitumour activity and cooperativity with gefitinib in mice grafted with geo and geo-gr tumours, incrementing their median survival and inhibiting the aforesaid protein expression and secretion in tumour specimens.  enzastaurin (ly317615) was initially developed as an antiangiogenic cancer therapy.  in conclusion, enzastaurin by interfering with signalling proteins implicated in egfr drug resistance markedly cooperates with gefitinib in sensitive and gefitinib-resistant tumours, thus overcoming and reverting such resistance and providing a rational basis for its development in patients resistant to anti-egfr drugs.  here we report on a multicenter, open-label, uncontrolled phase ii study of patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma without mgmt promoter hypermethylation treated with enzastaurin and radiation therapy within 4 study periods.  this review addresses the mechanism of action, development, preclinical studies, and clinical study results with enzastaurin.  we investigated the antitumour effect and ability to overcome the resistance to anti-egfr drugs of enzastaurin, an inhibitor of vegfr-dependent pkcbeta signalling.  we demonstrated the marked inhibitory activity of enzastaurin against geo colon and pc3 prostate cancer cells and their gefitinib-resistant counterparts geo-gr and pc3-gr, accompanied by inhibition of pakt and its effector pp70s6k, pgsk3beta and vegf expression and secretion.  enzastaurin alone presented not active in renal cell carcinoma cell lines.  glioblastoma treatment as now constituted offers increased survival measured in months over untreated patients. ||| ",no
Does Evolocumab improve cognitive function?,"erythropoietin (epo) improves verbal memory and reverses subfield hippocampal volume loss across depression and bipolar disorder (bd).  verbal memory and executive function were improved after the 24-week lev trial.  epo-associated cognitive improvement correlated with reduced cognitive complaints but not with quality of life or socio-occupational function.  in conclusion, pro-cognitive effects of epo occurred across affective disorders.  in epo-treated patients, baseline cognitive impairment increased the odds of treatment-efficacy on cognition at weeks 9 and 14 by a factor 9.7 (95% ci:1.2-81.1) and 9.9 (95% ci:1.1-88.4), respectively (p≤0.04).  we examine (i) whether epo improves speed of complex cognitive processing across bipolar and unipolar disorder, (ii) if objective and subjective baseline cognitive impairment increases patients׳ chances of treatment-efficacy and (iii) if cognitive improvement correlates with better subjective cognitive function, quality of life and socio-occupational capacity.  the potential to improve cognition in older women with estrogen or estrogen/progesterone therapy is currently a matter of intense debate.  epo improved speed of complex cognitive processing across affective disorders at weeks 9 and 14 (p≤0.05).  the results of this meta-analysis demonstrate that evolocumab significantly reduced low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, and no difference was noted between evolocumab 140 mg q2w and evolocumab 420 mg q4w.  evolocumab has been considered as an efficacious, safe and promising therapeutic modality for hypercholesterolemia and is associated with cardiovascular diseases.  levetiracetam (lev) is an antiepileptic drug (aed) that has favorable effects on cognition.  the results demonstrate that lev not only effectively reduces seizure frequency, but also possibly contributes to improvements in neuropsychological functions such as recall, language, interpersonal sensitivity, and paranoid ideation.  the aim of this study was to investigate the cognitive profile of ethosuximide.  as ethosuximide is a first-line therapy for absence seizures in childhood, and drug-induced cognitive impairment may interfere with development, learning, and academic achievement, these findings are of interest to clinicians who prescribe this drug, especially when informing parents.  the objective of this study was therefore to determine whether chronic efv therapy is a modifier of neurocognitive and neurometabolic function in the setting of suppressive highly active antiretroviral therapy.  the aim of this prospective, multicenter, open-label study was to investigate the efficacy of levetiracetam (lev) and determine its effects on cognitive and neuropsychological function.  we used repeated measures analysis of covariance to investigate the effect of epo on speed of complex cognitive processing.  epo improved picture recall and increased encoding-related activity in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlpfc) and temporo-parietal regions, but not in hippocampus.  a paucity of brain-related recovery, genetic and biomarker research in ect responses in the elderly was found: three studies have examined the effect of apoe-ɛ4 allele carriage on cognition in the depressed elderly receiving ect, and two have examined aβ changes after ect, with contradictory findings.  efavirenz (efv) may plausibly cause cognitive impairment. ||| ",no
Does GATA-1 regulate ribosomal protein genes?,"the ga-binding protein (gabp), a heterodimeric transcription factor with widespread tissue distribution, has been found to be a strong positive regulator of several ribosomal protein (rp)-encoding genes.  emerging studies have linked the ribosome to more selective control of gene regulation.  recent work has demonstrated that gtpases are likely to play key roles in the assembly of ribosomes in bacteria and eukaryotes.  multiple essential small gtpases are involved in the assembly of the ribosome or in the control of its activity.  our results thus demonstrate that obge expression is coupled to ribosomal gene expression.  this review highlights several bacterial ribosome assembly gtpases (ra-gtpases) and discusses possible functions for these proteins in the biogenesis of individual ribosomal subunits and subunit joining.  taken together with earlier studies, these new findings indicate that gabp can have a dual role as repressor or activator of rp gene transcription.  tor (target of rapamycin) has been previously implicated in transcriptional stimulation of the ribosomal protein (rp) genes via enhanced recruitment of nua4 (nucleosome acetyltransferase of h4) to the promoters.  the guanine-rich rna sequence binding factor 1 (grsf1) constitutes an ubiquitously occurring rna-binding protein (rbp), which belongs to the family of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein f/h (hnrnp f/h).  among them, obge (cgta) has been shown recently to act as a ribosome antiassociation factor that binds to ppgpp, a regulator whose best-known target is rna polymerase.  we demonstrate here that obge is expressed from an operon encoding two ribosomal proteins, that the operon's expression varies with the growth phase, and that it is dependent on the transcription regulators ppgpp and dksa.  within several of these transcripts, this level of regulation is mediated, at least in part, by internal ribosome entry sites.  stimulation of rrna synthesis by tif-ia may therefore provide a feed-forward mechanism to coregulate the levels of other ribosome components.  throughout the four phases of protein biosynthesis-initiation, elongation, termination, and recycling-the ribosome is controlled and regulated by at least one specified translational guanosine triphosphatase (trgtpase).  on interaction with the ribosomal a site, generally only one molecule of gtp is hydrolysed per aa-trna bound and peptide bond formed.  overexpression of tif-ia also elevates levels of both 5s rna and messenger rnas encoding ribosomal proteins.  to understand how the ribosome triggers gtp hydrolysis in translational gtpases, we have determined the crystal structure of ef-tu and aminoacyl-trna bound to the ribosome with a gtp analog, to 3.2 angstrom resolution.  potential gabp-binding sites are present in the promoters of numerous other rp genes, not only in upstream regions, but also in the immediate vicinity of the transcriptional start point.  the structure suggests a universal mechanism for gtpase activation and hydrolysis in translational gtpases on the ribosome.  we demonstrate here that gabp binds to the rps16 initiation region, and in so doing down-regulates rps16 transcription both in vivo and in vitro. ||| ",yes
Does GC content vary markedly within a given isochore?,"gc content varies greatly between different genomic regions in many eukaryotes.  mammalian genomes consist of regions differing in gc content, referred to as isochores or gc-content domains.  in general, gc-poor isochores tend to be longer than gc-rich ones.  the regional variation in gene g + c content might therefore be a reflection of the isochore structure of chromosomes, but the factors influencing the variation of nucleotide substitution rate are still open to question.  indeed, after correcting for possible biases, we show that intron gc content and size display isochore-specific correlations.  moreover, we demonstrated that the regional similarities in g + c content (isochores) and synonymous substitution rate were independent of each other.  bacterial genomes possess varying gc content (total guanines (gs) and cytosines (cs) per total of the four bases within the genome) but within a given genome, gc content can vary locally along the chromosome, with some regions significantly more or less gc rich than on average.  the variation of gc content is a key genome feature because it is associated with fundamental elements of genome organization.  most studies of this relationship have examined broad-scale compositional patterns, for example, total gc percentages in genomes and occurrence of gc-rich isochores.  (4) the true uniqueness of the human (or mammalian) genome is the presence of very high gc regions, which exhibit unusually high compositional heterogeneity and contain few long homogeneous segments (isochores).  variations in gc content between genomes have been extensively documented.  we have examined how the gc content varies within microbial genomes to assess whether this property can be associated with certain biological functions related to the organism's environment and phylogeny.  in order to determine whether this organization named isochore organization influences gene expression patterns, the relationship between gc content and gene expression has been investigated in man and mouse.  genomes with comparable gc contents can, however, still differ in the apportionment of the g and c nucleotides between the two dna strands.  our study indicates that, whereas gc contents of isochores may show variation among different classes of vertebrates, there is no consistent relationship between adaptation temperature and the percentage of thermal stability-enhancing g + c base pairs in protein-coding genes.  additionally, different window sizes result in different gc content distribution patterns within the same genome.  variation in gc content is assumed to correlate with various processes, including mutation biases, recombination, and environmental parameters.  it has been proposed that the mammalian genome comprises a mosaic of regions - termed isochores - with differing g + c content.  gc content, an important characteristic for a genome, is related to many important functions, and therefore gc content and its distribution are routinely reported for sequenced genomes.  we utilize a new quantity gcvar, the intra-genomic gc content variability with respect to the average gc content of the total genome. ||| ",no
Does HER2 under-expression lead to favorable response to trastuzumab?,"we aimed to investigate whether her2 positivity was still associated with worse outcome in high-risk estrogen receptor (er) positive patients treated with trastuzumab and chemotherapy.  the aim of this study is to investigate if the dependence of trastuzumab-mediated cancer cell her2 downregulation on immune effector cells represents a novel mechanism of action for trastuzumab.  furthermore, her2 downregulation in cancer cells induced by trastuzumab engagement of immune cells was correlated with the antibody's antitumor efficacy in vivo.  we further demonstrated that her2 downregulation in cancer cells by immune-cell-engaged trastuzumab was at the transcriptional level, not through the her2 degradation pathway.  despite selection based on human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (her2) overexpression, not all her2-positive patients benefit from trastuzumab therapy.  the her2 transmembrane receptor is a well-characterised predictive marker for trastuzumab benefit and may be associated with decreased benefit from endocrine therapy use.  this study reveals that engagement of immune effector cells by trastuzumab induces her2 downregulation in her2-expressing cancer cells, which represents a new function of immune cells in trastuzumab-mediated antitumor efficacy and serves as a novel mechanism of action for trastuzumab.  our results imply that her2 downregulation in cancer cells treated by trastuzumab may predict active engagement of immune effector cells in tumor microenvironment.  her2/neu (erbb-2) overexpression, which occurs in 15-20% of breast cancer cases, is associated with better response to treatment with the drug trastuzumab.  her2 downregulation of cancer cells by trastuzumab occurred only when trastuzumab was actively engaged with immune cells and cancer cells, as demonstrated consistently in co-cultures of cancer cell lines with pbmcs and in vivo mouse xenograft tumor models.  trastuzumab, which is a monoclonal antibody to her-2, is an effective treatment in some women with breast carcinomas that overexpress her-2, as demonstrated by immunohistochemistry.  we here show that the antitumor activity of  trastuzumab deruxtecan is dependent on the expression level of her2 protein in colorectal cancer (crc) cell lines negative for her2 amplification.  although amplification of the gene encoding human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (her2) is used as an indicator for response to trastuzumab, the reported response rate is low, and few patients with gastric cancer (gc) benefit from this individualized therapy.  our results thus suggest that  trastuzumab deruxtecan warrants further study as a potential treatment for crc tumors that express her2 protein in the absence of her2 amplification.  single-agent trastuzumab did not exhibit significant clinical activity against nonsmall cell lung carcinoma when her-2 expression levels were measured by immunohistochemistry.  co-expression of human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (her2) and hormone receptor (hr) predicted worse prognosis in early breast cancer before trastuzumab was developed.  furthermore, nuclear her4 predicted poor clinical response to trastuzumab monotherapy in patients undergoing a window study and was shown to be an independent poor prognostic factor in her2 positive breast cancer.  her2 expression was evaluated by western blotting, flow cytometry, and real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr) in cell lysates from co-cultures of multiple cancer cell lines with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs) in the presence or absence of trastuzumab.  the objective of this phase ii study was to determine whether trastuzumab would effect responses in patients with nonsmall cell lung carcinoma who had tumors that overexpressed her-2.  our data suggest that her4 plays a key role in relation to trastuzumab resistance in her2 positive breast cancer. ||| ",no
Does HuR bind to the untranslated regions (UTRs) of mRNAs?,"hur is an rna-binding protein that resides predominantly in the nucleus but shuttles to the cytosol carrying mrnas containing a uridylate-rich region in the 3'untranslated region.  hur, an rna binding protein, binds to adenine- and uridine-rich elements (are) in the 3'-untranslated region (utr) of target mrnas, regulating their stability and translation.  hur is a ubiquitous, rna binding protein that influences the stability and translation of several cellular mrnas.  hur is a regulator of mrna turnover or translation of inflammatory genes through binding to adenylate-uridylate-rich elements and related motifs present in the 3'untranslated region (utr) of mrnas.  human antigen r (hur) is a rna-binding protein, which binds to the au-rich element (are) in the 3'-untranslated region (3'-utr) of certain mrna and is involved in the export and stabilization of are-mrna.  hur, a protein that binds to specific mrna subsets, is increasingly recognized as a pivotal posttranscriptional regulator of gene expression.  hur is an rna-binding protein of the embryonic lethal abnormal vision (elav) family, which binds to the au-rich element (are) in the 3'-untranslated region (utr) of certain mrnas and is involved in the nucleo-cytoplasmic export and stabilization of are-mrnas.  human antigen r (hur) is a multitasking rna binding protein involved in posttranscriptional regulation by recognizing adenine- and uracile-rich elements placed at the 3'-untranslated regions of messenger rnas (mrnas).  in the nucleus hur binds to mrnas containing adenylate-uridylate rich elements in the 3'-untranslated region.  the rna-binding protein hu antigen r (hur) binds to au-rich elements (are) in the 3'-untranslated region (utr) of target mrnas.  hur is a ligand for nuclear mrnas containing adenylate-uridylate-rich elements in the 3'-untranslated region.  hur is a ligand for nuclear mrnas containing adenylate-uridylate rich elements in the 3'-untranslated region.  this hur motif was found in almost all mrnas previously reported to be hur targets, was located preferentially within 3' untranslated regions of all unigene transcripts examined, and was conserved in >50% of human and mouse homologous genes.  hur is a ligand for nuclear mrnas containing adenylate-uridylate-rich (are) elements in the 3'-untranslated region.  hur may influence expression of its ligand mrna through regulation of polyadenylation, translocation of the message to the cytosol, stabilization of the mrna and/or altering its translational efficiency.  here, hur was immunoprecipitated under conditions that preserved hur-rna interactions, and hur-bound target mrnas were identified by cdna array hybridization.  rna-binding proteins hur and auf1 bind to many common au-rich target mrnas and exert opposing influence on target mrna stability, but the functional interactions between hur and auf1 have not been systematically studied.  here, we report a novel role for hur, as a regulator of proteins assembling at the 3' untranslated region (utr) of viral rna in the context of hepatitis c virus (hcv) infection.  hur binding to au-rich elements within the 3' untranslated region of mrnas encoding oncogenes, growth factors, and various cytokines leads message stability and translation.  hur was known to stabilize many of these mrnas and/or modulated their translation, but the molecular processes by which hur affected the fate of target mrnas was largely unknown. ||| ",yes
Does HuR protein regulate the splicing process?,"the hur protein regulates the expression of thousands of cellular transcripts by modulating mrna splicing, trafficking, translation, and stability.  the rna-binding protein hur (human antigen r) associates with numerous transcripts, coding and noncoding, and controls their splicing, localization, stability, and translation.  the best studied of these, hur, is well characterized as a mediator of mrna stability and translation, and more recently, as a factor in nuclear functions such as pre-mrna splicing.  hur is a ubiquitous, rna binding protein that influences the stability and translation of several cellular mrnas.  the rna binding protein hur regulates the stability of many target mrnas.  hur is a ubiquitously expressed rna-binding protein that modulates gene expression at the post-transcriptional level.  multiple transcription factors and modulators of mrna stability that regulate hur mrna expression have been identified.  hur is a ubiquitous rna-binding protein (rbp) that associates with many mrnas encoding proliferative proteins.  hur is an rna-binding protein that regulates the post-transcriptional life of thousands of cellular mrnas and promotes cell survival.  analysis of hur upstream regions revealed sequences necessary for regulation of the shorter mrna.  hur, a protein that binds to specific mrna subsets, is increasingly recognized as a pivotal posttranscriptional regulator of gene expression.  the rna-binding protein hur regulates the stability and translation of numerous mrnas encoding stress-response and proliferative proteins.  we validated thousands of these rnas by analysis of overlap with recently published findings, including hur's interaction with rnas in the pathways of rna splicing and stability.  here, we report a novel role for hur, as a regulator of proteins assembling at the 3' untranslated region (utr) of viral rna in the context of hepatitis c virus (hcv) infection.  hur is a rna binding protein previously shown to stimulate proliferation, but the link between hur and proliferation in nsclc has not yet been evaluated.  the rna-binding protein hur, a member of the embryonic lethal abnormal vision/hu protein family, plays a critical role in many cellular processes, including cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and inflammatory response.  the rna-binding protein, hur, associates with the hur mrna, but the consequences of this interaction are unknown.  in this review, we describe the modifications that impact upon hur function on gene expression programs and disease states.  the rna-binding protein hur can stabilize and/or regulate the translation of target mrnas, thereby affecting the cellular responses to immune, proliferative, and damaging agents.  hur function is primarily regulated through posttranslational modifications that alter its subcellular localization and its ability to bind target rnas; such modifications include phosphorylation, methylation, ubiquitination, neddylation, and proteolytic cleavage. ||| ",yes
Does International Citicoline Trial on acUte Stroke trial supports efficacy of citicoline for stroke treatment?,"to determine the safety and efficacy of citicoline treatment in acute stroke patients.  this systematic review supports some benefits of citicoline in the treatment of acute ischemic stroke.  the international citicoline trial in acute stroke is a sequential phase iii study of the use of the drug citicoline in the treatment of acute ischaemic stroke, which was initiated in 2006 in 56 treatment centres.  citicoline is a drug approved for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke.  this study aims to assess whether starting citicoline treatment within 14 days after stroke onset improves the outcome in patients with acute ischemic stroke, as compared with placebo.  previous safety and efficacy trials in patients who have had acute strokes suggested that citicoline may improve neurologic outcome with minimal side effects.  citicoline is approved in some countries for the treatment of acute ischaemic stroke.  the results of this study indicate that citicoline was safe but ineffective in improving the outcome of patients with acute ischemic stroke who were enrolled in this trial.  in conclusion, this meta-analysis provides evidence of citicoline efficacy in stroke animal models and shows the optimal neuroprotective profile and the missing experimental requirements before jumping into clinical trials.  the neuroprotective actions of citicoline have been documented for experimental stroke therapy.  the neuroprotective potential of citicoline in acute ischemic stroke has been shown in many experimental studies and, although the exact mechanisms are still unknown, a clinical phase iii trial is currently underway.  this systemic review is based on ""pubmed"" and ""science direct"" search results for citicoline role in stroke and tbi.  this study suggests that oral citicoline can be used safely with minimal side effects in acute stroke treatment.  in this review, we focus on the latest publications or communications or both and on the major ongoing experimental and clinical projects involving citicoline in stroke recovery.  our present study was designed to check whether citicoline also enhances neuroregeneration after experimental stroke.  cytidine diphosphate choline (citicoline) has been previously shown to have efficacy in reducing the functional impairments associated with acute stroke.  citicoline was safe but ineffective in improving the outcome of patients with acute ischemic stroke as measured by the planned analyses.  a previous dose-comparison trial in patients with acute stroke found that 500 mg of citicoline appeared to improve neurological outcome with minimal side effects.  in humans, although a recent trial international citicoline trial on acute stroke (ictus) has shown that global recovery is similar in cdp-choline and placebo groups, cdp-choline was shown to be more beneficial in some patients, such as those with moderate stroke severity and not treated with t-pa. several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the beneficial actions of cdp-choline.  under the circumstances of the ictus trial, citicoline is not efficacious in the treatment of moderate-to-severe acute ischaemic stroke. ||| ",no
Does Jarid2 play a role in early embryo development?,"jarid2 can affect early embryonic development by regulating the methylation level of h3k27me3, which is closely related to normal early embryonic development.  jarid2, which is a member of the jumonji demethylase protein family, is a regulator of early embryonic development and can regulate mouse development and embryonic stem cell (esc) differentiation by modifying histone lysines.  however, jarid2 has also been shown to exert pleiotropic prc2-independent actions during embryogenesis.  in summary, the present study identified the expression pattern of jarid2 in bovine oocytes and at each early embryonic stage, and the results suggest that jarid2 plays a key role in early embryonic development by regulating the expression of oct4, sox2 and c-myc via modification of h3k27me3 expression.  jumonij (jmj)/jarid2 plays important roles in embryonic development and functions as a transcriptional repressor.  here, we have investigated the role of jarid2 during pancreas development.  therefore, our study provides new mechanistic insights into epigenetic regulation by jarid2, which will enhance our understanding of the molecular basis of other organ development and biological processes.  jarid2/jumonji critically regulates developmental processes including cardiovascular development.  thus, our study identifies jarid2 as a fine-tuner of gene expression during late stages of pancreatic endocrine cell development.  jarid2 is a component of the polycomb repressor complex 2 (prc2), which is responsible for genome-wide h3k27me3 deposition, in embryonic stem cells.  inactivation of jarid2 in endocrine progenitors demonstrates that jarid2 functions after endocrine specification.  jarid2 is an accessory component of polycomb repressive complex-2 (prc2) required for the differentiation of embryonic stem cells (escs).  a role for jarid2 in the recruitment of prc2 to target genes silenced during differentiation has been put forward, but the molecular details remain unclear.  we next detected the mrna expression levels of embryonic development-related genes (oct4, sox2 and c-myc) after jarid2 knockdown through jarid2-2830-sirna microinjection to investigate the molecularpathwayunderlying the regulation of h3k27me3 by jarid2 during early embryonic development.  here, we show that deletion of jarid2 in mouse epidermis reduces the proliferation and potentiates the differentiation of postnatal epidermal progenitors, without affecting epidermal development.  the results showed that the relative expression levels of these genes in 2-cell embryos weresignificantly higher than those in the blastocyst stage, and expression levels were significantly increased after jarid2 knockdown.  the results showed that jarid2 is highly expressed in the germinal vesicle (gv), mii, 2-cell, 4-cell, 8-cell, 16-cell and blastocyst stages, but the relative expression level of jarid2 in bovine gv oocytes is significantly lower than that at other oocyte/embryonic stages (p < 0.05), and jarid2 is expressed primarily in the nucleus.  jarid2 was recently identified as an important component of the mammalian polycomb repressive complex 2 (prc2), where it has a major effect on prc2 recruitment in mouse embryonic stem cells.  the identification of jarid2 as a potential regulator of notch1 signaling has broad implications for many cellular processes including development, stem cell maintenance, and tumor formation.  to investigate the expression pattern of jarid2 and the effect of jarid2-induced h3k27 methylation in bovine oocytes and early embryonic stages, jarid2 mrna expression and localization were detected in bovine oocytes and early embryos via qrt-pcr and immunofluorescence in the present study. ||| ",yes
Does MC1R palmitoylation reduce pigmentation?,"although mc1r signaling is critically dependent on its palmitoylation primarily mediated by the zdhhc13 protein-acyl transferase, whether increasing mc1r palmitoylation represents a viable therapeutic target to limit melanomagenesis in redheads is unknown.  the mc1r gene plays a crucial role in pigmentation synthesis.  here we identify a specific and efficient in vivo strategy to induce mc1r palmitoylation for therapeutic benefit.  functional analyses show that this variant reduces mc1r activity to a level that alters hair and/or skin pigmentation in humans.  the melanocortin 1 receptor (mc1r) regulates pigmentation in humans and other vertebrates.  melanocortin-1 receptor (mc1r) plays a key role in skin pigmentation, and its variants are linked with a higher melanoma risk.  the melanocortin 1 receptor (mc1r) is a melanocytic gs protein coupled receptor that regulates skin pigmentation, uv responses, and melanoma risk.  the melanocortin receptor, mc1r, is a key regulator of pigmentation in mammals, and is necessary for production of dark eumelanin pigment.  diminished function alleles of mc1r are associated with decreased tanning and increased melanoma risk, which has been attributed to increased rates of mutation.  beyond its role in pigmentation, mc1r is increasingly recognized as promoting uv-induced dna damage repair.  in particular, study of the mc1r may provide insights into the lightening of skin colour observed in most european populations.  the melanocortin 1 receptor (mc1r) mediates the tanning response through induction of camp and downstream pigmentary enzymes.  variant alleles of the human melanocortin 1 receptor (mc1r) reduce the ability of melanocytes to produce the dark pigment eumelanin, with r alleles being most deficient.  the melanocortin-1 receptor (mc1r) gene is a key determinant of the physiological variation in human skin pigmentation.  the g protein-coupled mc1r is expressed in melanocytes and has a pivotal role in human skin pigmentation, with reduced function in human genetic variants exhibiting a red hair phenotype and increased melanoma predisposition.  the melanocortin 1 receptor (mc1r), which signals through camp, is a melanocytic transmembrane receptor involved in pigmentation, adaptive tanning, and melanoma resistance.  these results reveal new targets for mc1r signaling, and point to a previously unappreciated role for a mc1r-dependent paracrine effect of melanocytes on other components of the skin.  homozygous loss of function of the melanocortin 1 receptor (mc1r) is associated with a pheomelanotic pigment phenotype and increased melanoma risk.  variants of mc1r with reduced function are associated with pale skin color and red hair in humans of primarily european origin.  mc1r polymorphisms also confer melanoma risk independent of pigment. ||| ",no
Does MVIIA and MVIIC bind to the same calcium channel?,"here, we have examined the action of mviia on mutant and wild type calcium channels transiently expressed in tsa-201 cells.  at higher concentrations (approximately 3 microm), mviia reversibly blocked l-, p/q-, and r-type, but not t-type channels, indicating that the overall architecture of the mviia site is conserved in all types of high voltage-activated calcium channels.  these channels, however, seem to possess binding sites for omega-conotoxins mviic and mviid whose characteristics differ considerably from those described to occur in the brain; they might represent a subset of q-type ca2+ channels or an entirely new subtype of voltage-dependent high-threshold ca2+ channel.  we propose a model in which n-type calcium channels can form both reversible and irreversible complexes with mviia.  omega-conotoxin mviic binds to p/q-type calcium channels with high affinity and n-type channels with low affinity.  despite their high sequence homology, the peptide neurotoxins omega-conotoxin mviia and mviic selectively block n- and p/q-type calcium channels, respectively.  to study the recognition mechanism of calcium channel subtypes, two chimeric analogs of omega-conotoxin mviia and mviic were synthesized by exchanging their n- and c-terminal halves.  a kinetic analysis of the mviia effects on the n-type channel showed that mviia blocked resting, open, and inactivated channels.  recent reports have suggested that different types of ca(2+)-activated k(+) channels may be selectively expressed either in the vascular endothelial cells (ecs) or smooth muscle cells (smcs) of a single artery.  similar to the previously reported action of omega-conopeptide gvia, omega-conopeptide mviia irreversibly blocks imr32 hva calcium channel currents at low concentrations.  these results suggest that mviic interacts with p/q-type channels via a large surface, in good agreement with previous observations using chimeric analogs.  in the distinctive effects of atp, gtp, and zn2+ on the ca2+ channel activity observed in both the mv and the liposome systems, the common factor was the presence of annexin v. from this we conclude that ca2+ entry into mv results from the presence of annexin v in these membrane-enclosed structures.  voltage-dependent calcium (ca(2+), ca(v)1.2) channels are the primary ca(2+) entry pathway in smooth muscle cells of resistance-size (myogenic) arteries, but their molecular identity remains unclear.  this entry pathway was found to be independent of dihydropyridine-sensitive ca2+ channels and inhibited by increased external mg2+ concentration.  these data strengthen the previously established conclusion that q-type ca2+ channels that contribute to the regulation of secretion and are sensitive to omega-conotoxins mviic and mviid are present in bovine chromaffin cells.  these findings indicate a cell-specific distribution of ca(2+)-activated k(+) channels in smcs and ecs from a single arterial site.  these results suggest that voltage-dependent facilitation of the ca(v)1.2 channel depends on the phosphorylation of ser1512/ser1570 by calmodulin kinase ii.  the precipitated ca(v)1.2 channel was phosphorylated in the presence of calmodulin and ca2+.  calcium-dependent facilitation of l-type calcium channels has been reported to depend on the function of calmodulin kinase ii.  binding assay for both n- and p/q-type calcium channels showed that amino acid residues restricted to the n-terminal half are important for the recognition of n-type channels, whereas essential residues for p/q-type channel recognition are widely spread over the whole omega-conotoxin molecule. ||| ",no
Does MicroRNA-21 (miR-21) contribute to cardiovascular disease?,"this review article summarizes the research progress regarding the roles of mir-21 in cardiovascular disease.  mir-21 might be a novel therapeutic target in cardiovascular diseases.  this study is aimed at exploring the role and potential molecular mechanism of microrna-21 (mir-21) in coronary heart disease (chd).  microrna-21 has been implicated in diabetic complication, including diabetic cardiomyopathy.  the microrna-21 (mir-21) is known to play a major role in cancer progression; however, its function in the cardiovascular system appears to be even more complex and conflicting.  microrna-21 (mir-21) is a highly expressed microrna (mirna) in cardiovascular system.  it is unknown whether fibrosis-associated micrornas: mir-21, mir-26, mir-29, mir-30 and mir-133a are linked to cardiovascular (cv) outcome.  microrna-21 (mir-21) is a proproliferative and antiapoptotic mir, which we showed to be elevated in metabolic syndrome.  accordingly, mir-21 is proven to be involved in the pathogenesis of the above-mentioned cardiovascular diseases as demonstrated by both loss-of-function and gain-of-function approaches.  microrna 21 (mirna‑21) promotes the development of cardiac fibrosis, hypertrophy and heart failure.  circulating mirna‑21 has potential to be a biomarker of heart failure.  mir-21 is a microrna implicated in cancer, development, and cardiovascular diseases and expressed in the central nervous system (cns), especially after injury.  mir-21 is found to play important roles in vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation and apoptosis, cardiac cell growth and death, and cardiac fibroblast functions.  the aim of this study was to investigate the association of mir-21 with visfatin, inflammation, atherosclerosis and acute coronary syndrome (acs).  it seems that microrna-21 (mir-21) and visfatin, a novel adipocytokine, play roles in inflammation and atherosclerosis.  gain-of-function and loss-of-function assays demonstrated that mir-21-3p mediated the crucial role in diabetic cardiac fibrosis.  previous studies have demonstrated that microrna-204 (mir-204) is involved in atherosclerosis and vascular calcification.  aim: circulating microrna-21 (mir-21) has been utilized as a diagnostic tool in the assessment of heart failure (hf).  a cox regression analysis identified mir-21 expression as an independent predictor of survival (p = 0.048); a relative increase in mir-21 expression (>1) was associated with a 50% reduction in the risk of mortality.  to characterize mir-21 expression in the plasma of individuals with or without metabolic syndrome (mets), 58 mets cases and 96 non-mets controls were investigated. ||| ",yes
Does NADPH oxidase 5 require any subunit for function?,"nadph oxidase 5 (nox5) is a homologue of the gp91(phox) subunit of the phagocyte nadph oxidase.  here, we show that nadph oxidase subunits are present in neurons.  nadph oxidase produces ros, although the expression of its five subunits are thought to be restricted largely to non-neuronal cells.  nadh cytochrome b(5) reductase (b(5)r; ec 1.6.2.2; diaphorase i; nadh: ferricytochrome b(5) oxidoreductase) is an fad-containing protein, which, along with the hemoprotein cytochrome b(5) (cyt b(5)), mediates electron transfer from nadh to fatty acid desaturases, p450 oxidases, methemoglobin, and ascorbyl free radical.  nad(p)h cytochrome b(5) oxidoreductase (ncb5or), comprising cytochrome b(5) and cytochrome b(5) reductase domains, is widely distributed in eukaryotic organisms.  nadh-cytochrome b5 reductase (b5r) is a member of a flavoenzyme family of dehydrogenases-electron transferases that participates in the transfer of electrons from the nadh generated in glycolysis to cytochrome b5.  the expression and functional significance of nadph oxidase 5 (nox5) and its five isoforms in vascular cells is poorly understood.  previous studies have demonstrated that the nadh-dependent cytochrome b(5) electron transfer pathway can support some cytochrome p450 monooxygenases in vitro in the absence of their normal redox partner, nadph-cytochrome p450 oxidoreductase.  the nadph oxidase is the sole enzymatic complex that produces, in a controlled way, superoxide anions.  the complete nadh dehydrogenase subunit 1 (nad1) orf in oenothera mitochondria is encoded by five exons.  the mitochondrial rotenone-sensitive nadh:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex i) comprises more than 35 subunits, the majority of which are encoded by the nucleus.  the nadph oxidases (noxs) are a family of transmembrane oxidoreductases that produce superoxide and other reactive oxygen species (ros).  nox5 is expressed in lymphoid organs and testis and distinguished from the other nadph oxidases by its unique n terminus, which contains three canonical ef-hands, ca(2+)-binding domains.  nadh-cytochrome b5 reductase (b5r), a flavoprotein consisting of nadh and flavin adenine dinucleotide (fad) binding domains, catalyzes electron transfer from the two-electron carrier nadh to the one-electron carrier cytochrome b5 (cb5).  the oxidative phosphorylation system (oxphos) consists of five multi-enzyme complexes, complexes i-v, and is a key component of mitochondrial function relating to energy production, oxidative stress, cell signaling and apoptosis.  the oxphos system consists of five multiprotein complexes, the individual subunits of which are encoded either by the mitochondrial or by the nuclear genome.  delta1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthase (p5cs; ec not assigned), a mitochondrial inner membrane, atp- and nadph-dependent, bifunctional enzyme, catalyzes the reduction of glutamate to delta1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate, a critical step in the de novo biosynthesis of proline and ornithine.  in chlamydomonas reinhardtii, only five components (nd1, nd2, nd4, nd5 and nd6) are coded for by the mitochondrial genome.  the oxidative phosphorylation system (oxphos) is organized in five multi-protein complexes, comprising four complexes (i-iv) of the respiratory chain and atp synthase (complex v).  blm, fecl3, cytochrome b5 and nadh were absolutely necessary to provide these effects. ||| ",no
Does PCSK9 (Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9) binds with HDL-receptor (HDL-R)?,"proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin 9 (pcsk9), a protein regulating the number of cell-surface ldl receptors (ldlr), circulates partially associated to plasma lipoproteins.  the proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (pcsk9) is a secreted protein that interacts with the low-density lipoprotein (ldl) receptor at the surface of hepatocytes to regulate circulating ldl cholesterol levels.  proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (pcsk9) is a serine protease involved in the regulation of ldl receptor (ldlr) expression and apolipoprotein b lipoprotein cholesterol metabolism.  proprotein convertase subtilisin-kexin type 9 (pcsk9) is a key regulator of low density lipoprotein (ldl) receptor processing, but the pcsk9 pathway may also be implicated in the metabolism of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins.  pcsk9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9) is a polymorphic gene whose protein product regulates plasma ldl cholesterol (ldlc) concentrations by shuttling liver ldl receptors (ldlrs) for degradation.  serum proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (pcsk9) concentrations have been shown to be positively associated with ldl cholesterol (ldl-c), but the relationship between pcsk9 and coronary atherosclerosis lesions remains unclear.  proprotein convertase, subtilisin/kexin type 9 (pcsk9), a key regulator of plasma ldl-cholesterol (ldl-c) and cardiovascular risk, is produced in liver and secreted into plasma where it binds hepatic ldl receptors (ldlr), leading to their degradation.  proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (pcsk9) is a serine protease that regulates cholesterol metabolism through low-density lipoprotein receptor degradation and that has been linked to cardiovascular (cv) disease.  proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (pcsk9) is a serine protease that regulates cholesterol metabolism through low-density lipoprotein receptor degradation and that has been linked to cardiovascular (cv) disease.  proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (pcsk9) is a key player in lipid metabolism, as it degrades ldl receptors from hepatic cell membranes.  proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (pcsk9) is a serine protease that regulates cholesterol metabolism through low-density lipoprotein receptor degradation, and which has been linked to cardiovascular risk.  proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (pcsk9) is a serine protease that regulates cholesterol metabolism through low-density lipoprotein receptor degradation and that has been linked with cardiovascular risk.  proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (pcsk9) is a serine protease that regulates cholesterol metabolism and has been linked to cardiovascular (cv) risk.  proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (pcsk9) is a serine protease that regulates cholesterol metabolism and has been linked to cardiovascular (cv) risk.  proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (pcsk9) is a protease that regulates low density lipoprotein receptor (ldlr) protein levels.  proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 (pcsk9) is a key regulator of serum ldl-cholesterol (ldl-c) levels.  proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (pcsk9) post-transcriptionally degrades the low density lipoprotein receptors (ldlr).  proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (pcsk9) posttranslationally promotes the degradation of the low-density lipoprotein receptor (ldlr) in hepatocytes and increases plasma ldl cholesterol.  proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin 9 (pcsk9) is the ninth member of the proprotein convertase family.  proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (pcsk9) is the most recently identified member of the proprotein convertase family. ||| ",no
Does PU.1 (SPI1) affect NF-kB binding?,"spi1, also referred to as pu.1, is an ets family transcription factor that interacts with irf2, irf4, and irf8.  we found that deletion of the carboxyl-terminal 28 amino acids of pu.1 disrupted pu.1-nf-il6 beta physical interaction.  these results demonstrate that phosphorylation of pu.1 at ser148 is necessary for interaction with nf-em5 and suggest that this phosphorylation can regulate transcriptional activity.  we have characterized the physical and functional interactions between pu.1 and nf-il6 beta, a leucine zipper transcription factor implicated in inflammatory responses.  pu.1 recruits the binding of a second b cell-restricted nuclear factor, nf-em5, to a dna site in the immunoglobulin kappa 3' enhancer.  when pu.1 was added to the assay, a supershifted dna band was found, indicating that pu.1 and nfy proteins bind to the same dna molecule.  in this study, we show by far western blot analyses that multiple nuclear proteins are capable of physically interacting with pu.1.  cbp potentiated spi-b-mediated transcription of the reporter gene driven by the multimerized pu.1/spi-b binding sites.  expression of wild-type pu.1 increased expression of a reporter construct containing the pu.1 and nf-em5 binding sites nearly sixfold, whereas the ser148 mutant form only weakly activated transcription.  phosphorylation of bacterially produced pu.1 by purified casein kinase ii modified it to a form that interacted with nf-em5 and that recruited nf-em5 to bind to dna.  pu.1 is a transcription factor that belongs to the ets family of dna binding proteins.  in transient expression assays, we found that pu.1 and nf-il6 beta can functionally cooperate to synergistically activate transcription.  dephosphorylated pu.1 bound to dna but did not interact with nf-em5.  the inhibitory effect of pu.1 was obtained with the dna binding domain of the protein, but not with the activation domain.  dna binding by nf-em5 requires a protein-protein interaction with pu.1 and specific dna contacts.  electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that pu.1 and nf-il6 beta can simultaneously bind to adjacent dna binding sites, but apparently do not influence the kinetics or affinity of each other's dna binding.  pu.1 produced in bacteria did not interact with nf-em5.  both brf1 promoter 4 (brf1p4) and gtf3c2 promoter 2 (gtf3c2p2) contain putative sp1-binding sites, suggesting that sp1 affects pol iii gene transcription by regulating brf1 and gtf3c2 expression.  phosphopeptide analysis of bacterially produced pu.1 suggested that ser148 is phosphorylated by casein kinase ii.  we present evidence that pu.1 binds to the promoter of the i-a beta gene, i.e. ||| ",yes
Does RNA polymerase II have RNA cleavage activity?,"rna polymerase ii (pol ii) utilises the same active site for polymerization and intrinsic cleavage.  rna polymerase ii contains a ribonuclease activity which is stimulated by the transcription elongation factor sii.  rna polymerase ii (pol ii) is a well-characterized dna-dependent rna polymerase, which has also been reported to have rna-dependent rna polymerase (rdrp) activity.  we purified rna polymerase ii from mutant yeast and assayed its ability to cleave and re-extend the nascent rna following sii treatment.  there is, however, evidence that pol ii also possesses rna-dependent rna polymerase (rdrp) activity.  rna polymerase (pol) ii catalyses dna-dependent rna synthesis during gene transcription.  in eukaryotes, mrna synthesis is catalyzed by rna polymerase ii and involves several distinct steps, including transcript initiation, elongation, cleavage, and transcript release.  transcription elongation factor s-ii stimulates cleavage of nascent transcripts generated by rna polymerase ii stalled at transcription arrest sites.  to approach this question we have partially purified rna polymerase ii transcription complexes paused early in elongation.  rna polymerase ii ternary complex cleaves its nascent transcript in a 3'-->5' direction in the presence of elongation factor sii (izban, m. g., and luse, d. s. (1992) genes & dev.  rna polymerase ii (rnap ii) is responsible for transcription of mrna precursors in eukaryotic cells.  the prevailing view of the rna polymerase ii (rnap ii) transcription cycle is that rnap ii is recruited to the promoter, transcribes a linear dna template, then terminates transcription and dissociates from the template.  in vitro experiments have shown that this action promotes rna polymerase ii to read through these transcription arrest sites.  we have characterized the cleavage products generated during the truncation process with a variety of stalled rna polymerase ii ternary complexes containing uniformly labeled transcripts.  a sensitive assay for detection of eukaryotic rna polymerase ii has been developed.  these studies suggest how rna polymerase ii unwinds dna, how it separates the rna product from the dna template and how it incorporates nucleoside triphosphate (ntp) substrates into the growing rna chain.  human rna polymerase ii is shown to be associated with a 3'-->5' exonuclease activity that removes nucleoside 5'-monophosphates from the 3' end of the transcripts in isolated ternary complexes.  this article is part of a special issue entitled: rna polymerase ii transcript elongation.  we have addressed whether the intrinsic 3'-->5' nuclease activity of human rna polymerase ii (pol ii) can proofread during transcription in vitro.  two complementary x-ray studies of the interaction between rna polymerase ii and nucleic acids have improved our understanding of mrna elongation. ||| ",yes
Does Rad9 interact with Aft1 in S.cerevisiae?,"rad9 functions in the dna-damage checkpoint pathway of saccharomyces cerevisiae.  the rad9 protein is a key adaptor protein in saccharomyces cerevisiae dna damage checkpoint pathways.  rad9 is required for the mec1/tel1-dependent activation of saccharomyces cerevisiae dna damage checkpoint pathways mediated by rad53 and chk1.  human rad9 (hrad9), a structural homologue of yeast schizosaccharomyces pombe rad9, is involved in cell cycle checkpoints and apoptosis.  this work extends data showing that separable domains within the rad9 adaptor protein allow it to activate two distinct kinase signalling pathways independently of each other.  we show here that the n-terminus of rad9 is specifically important for phosphorylation and activation of the chk1 kinase but not for the phosphorylation and activation of the rad53 kinase.  in saccharomyces cerevisiae, the rad1 and rad10 genes are involved in dna nucleotide excision repair (ner) and in a pathway of mitotic recombination that occurs between direct repeat dna sequences.  the mechanisms by which rad9 interacts with, and activates, rad53 are well understood.  dna damage induces rad9 phosphorylation, and rad53 specifically associates with phosphorylated rad9.  rad9 is also implicated in nucleotide excision repair (ner); however, its precise role is still unclear.  human rad9 protein (hrad9) is a homolog of the fission yeast rad9 protein, one of the six so-called checkpoint rad proteins involved in the early steps of dna damage checkpoint response in schizosaccharomyces pombe.  these data suggest that functionally independent domains within rad9 regulate rad53 and chk1, and support the model that fha domain-mediated recognition of rad9 phosphopeptides couples rad53 to the dna damage checkpoint pathway.  the saccharomyces cerevisiae rad9 and rad24 are two cell cycle checkpoint genes required for uv-dependent up-regulation of a battery of genes involved in different metabolic pathways.  in saccharomyces cerevisiae, rad18 functions in post-replication repair pathways, such as error-free damage bypass involving rad30 (poleta) and error-prone damage bypass involving rev3/7 (polzeta).  consistent with the in vivo function in recruiting rad53, rad9 phosphopeptides are bound by rad53 forkhead-associated (fha) domains in vitro.  we report here that multiple mec1/tel1 consensus q sites within rad9 are phosphorylated in response to dna damage.  however, little was known about how rad9 facilitates the activation of chk1.  these rad9 phosphorylation sites are selectively required for activation of the rad53 branch of the checkpoint pathway.  the role that rad1-rad10 plays in recombination is likely to resemble its activity in ner by acting upon partially unpaired dna intermediates such as those formed by recombination mechanisms involving single-strand dna annealing.  the chk1 activation domain (cad) of rad9 is specifically important for signalling cell-cycle arrest after cdc13-1- and yku70delta-induced telomere damage but not for tolerating ultraviolet-induced damage or inhibiting nuclease activity at telomeres. ||| ",yes
Does SARM1 deletion cause neurodegeneration?,"sarm1 is known to mediate neuronal cell degeneration through depletion of essential metabolite nad and induction of energy crisis.  sarm1 is known for its role in axonal degeneration, but a role for sarm1 in photoreceptor cell degeneration has not been reported.  sarm1 function and nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase 2 (nmnat2) loss both promote axon degeneration, but their relative relationship in the process is unknown.  sarm1 is the central executioner of the axonal degeneration pathway that culminates in depletion of axonal nad+, yet the identity of the underlying nad+-depleting enzyme(s) is unknown.  sarm1, a protein with critical nadase activity, is a central executioner in a conserved programme of axon degeneration.  these findings of disease-associated coding variants that alter sarm1 function build on previously reported genome-wide significant association with als for a neighbouring, more common sarm1 intragenic single nucleotide polymorphism (snp) to support a contributory role of sarm1 in these disorders.  hence, the sarm1 enzyme represents a novel therapeutic target for axonopathies.  we report seven rare missense or in-frame microdeletion human sarm1 variant alleles in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (als) or other motor nerve disorders that alter the sarm1 auto-inhibitory arm domain and constitutively hyperactivate sarm1 nadase activity.  overall, our data indicate that endogenous sarm1 has the capacity to consume nad in photoreceptor cells and identifies a previously unappreciated role for sarm1-dependent cell death in photoreceptor cell degeneration.  here, we show that nmnat2 loss and resultant changes to nmnat metabolites occur in injured sarm1-deficient axons despite their delayed degeneration and that axon degeneration specifically induced by nmnat2 depletion requires sarm1.  using traumatic and vincristine-induced injury models in neurons, we demonstrate that the nadase activity of full-length sarm1 is required in axons to promote axonal nad+ depletion and axonal degeneration after injury.  strikingly, sarm1 deficiency also corrects axon outgrowth in mice lacking nmnat2, independently of nmnat metabolites, preventing perinatal lethality.  here, we bring together historical and recent experimental findings to conclude that there is a possibility that sod1 loss of function may play a modifying role in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.  dominant mutations in superoxide dismutase 1 (sod1) cause degeneration of motor neurons in a subset of inherited amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (als).  nmnat2-depletion-dependent degeneration of established axons and restricted extension of developing axons are thus both sarm1 dependent, and sarm1 acts either downstream of nmnat2 loss and nmn accumulation in a linear pathway or in a parallel branch of a convergent pathway.  finally, we demonstrate that sarm1 deficiency preserves cone visual function in the surviving photoreceptors when assayed by electroretinography.  here, we demonstrate that sarm1 is expressed in photoreceptors, and using retinal tissue explant, we confirm that activation of sarm1 causes destruction of nad pools in the photoreceptor layer.  from analysing published data from patients with sod1-amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, we find a marked loss of sod1 enzyme activity arising from almost all mutations.  mutations in the gene superoxide dismutase 1 (sod1) are causative for familial forms of the neurodegenerative disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.  mutant sod1 protein likely gains a novel cytotoxic property, leading to the death of motor neurons. ||| ",no
Does SCRIB deregulation promote cancer?,"scrib is a polarity regulator known to be abnormally expressed in cancer at the protein level.  scrib is frequently amplified in human cancers but does not localize properly to cell-cell junctions, suggesting that mislocalization of scrib disrupts its tumor-suppressive activities.  here we report that, in breast cancer, an additional and hidden dimension of deregulations exists: an unexpected scrib exon usage pattern appears to mark a more malignant tumor phenotype and significantly correlates with survival.  scribble (scrib) is a tumor-suppressor protein, playing critical roles in establishing and maintaining epithelial cell polarity.  scavenger receptor class b type i (sr-bi) has been reported to be involved in carcinogenesis of several human cancers.  thus, the inclusion/exclusion of specific scrib exons is a mechanistic hallmark of breast cancer, which could potentially be exploited to develop more efficient diagnostics and therapies.  using chemical reporters, here we showed that scrib localization was regulated by s-palmitoylation at conserved cysteine residues.  overall, our findings established that scca1 contributes to tumorigenesis by promoting emt and a upr-dependent induction of nf-κb and il6 autocrine signaling that promotes a protumorigenic inflammation.  since e2f/rb pathway deregulation is a general hallmark of human cancer, it remains unclear whether this deregulation is of particular importance in scas or whether it reflects a common oncological feature.  the serine/cysteine protease inhibitor scca1 (serpinb3) is upregulated in many advanced cancers with poor prognosis, but there is limited information about whether it makes functional contributions to malignancy.  in summary, we demonstrated that zdhhc7-mediated scrib palmitoylation is critical for scrib membrane targeting, cell polarity and tumor suppression, providing new mechanistic insights of how dynamic protein palmitoylation regulates cell polarity and tumorigenesis.  palmitoylation-deficient mutants of scrib were mislocalized, leading to disruption of cell polarity and loss of their tumor-suppressive activities to oncogenic yap, mapk and pi3k/akt pathways.  here, we show that scca1 expression promoted oncogenic transformation and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (emt) in mammary epithelial cells, and that scca1 silencing in breast cancer cells halted their proliferation.  we further found that zdhhc7 was the major palmitoyl acyltransferase regulating scrib.  methylated socs-1 was associated with significant suppression of socs-1 expression in tumors.  the existence of an egfr-negative case reveals that egfr expression is not always required for skin carcinogenesis, but expression of egfr might confer metastatic potential of cutaneous sccs.  knockout of zdhhc7 led to scrib mislocalization and yap activation, and disruption of scrib's suppressive activities in hras(v12)-induced cell invasion.  down syndrome critical region 1 (dscr1) is associated with carcinogenesis and tumor growth in several types of malignancy.  here, we show that pkcalpha promotes head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (scchn) by a feed-forward network leading to cell cycle deregulation.  moreover, overexpression of dscr1-4 inhibited tumor growth and tumor angiogenesis in vivo. ||| ",yes
Does Serca2a bind PLN in the heart?,"this review focuses on advances in the understanding of molecular regulation of serca2a by pln and sln, and their implications for cardiac hypertrophy and failure in vivo.  in a co-immunoprecipitation of pln with serca2a, the physical interaction between the two proteins was increased in pugnac-treated cardiomyocytes.  during heart failure, pln expression is downregulated with serca2a; however, the mechanism of its regulation is not fully understood.  these data show that overexpression of nf-sln can inhibit serca2a in the absence of pln and that the inhibition of serca2a is correlated with impairment of contractility and calcium cycling in cardiomyocytes.  phospholamban (pln) regulates the function of serca2a via its ser(16)-phosphorylation.  phospholamban (pln) regulates cardiac type sarco (endo)plasmic reticulum ca(2+)-atpase (serca2a) via ser(16)-phosphorylation.  sarcolipin (sln) inhibits the cardiac sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum ca2+ atpase (serca2a) by direct binding and is superinhibitory if it binds as a binary complex with phospholamban (pln).  phospholamban (plb) regulates the cardiac ca2+-atpase (serca2a) in sarcoplasmic reticulum (sr).  in nf-sln tg/pln ko cardiac microsomes, the apparent affinity of serca2a for ca2+ was decreased compared with non-tg littermate pln ko hearts.  phospholamban (pln) and its homologue sarcolipin (sln) are the endogenous regulators of serca2a.  evidence is accumulating that serca2a is intimately involved in the pathogenesis of cardiac hypertrophy and failure.  cardiac-type sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum ca(2)-atpase (serca2a) plays a major role in cardiac muscle contractility.  recent studies using transgenic mouse models have demonstrated that sln is an important regulator of cardiac sr ca2+ atpase 2a (serca2a).  highly specific monoclonal antibodies were used to compare the subcellular distributions of serca2a, plb, and junctin (jcn) in dog heart tissue.  phospholamban (plb) is an inhibitor of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (sr) ca2+-atpase (serca).  the cardiac isoform of sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum ca(2)(+) adenosine triphosphatase (serca2a) plays an important role in the contraction and relaxation of cardiac muscle.  since the type 2 sarco/endoplasmic reticulum ca2+ atpase (serca2a) plays a central role in cardiac ca2+ homeostasis, we studied whether ps1 regulates the cardiac serca2a function.  this might define a novel mechanism by which pln regulation of serca2a is altered under conditions where o-glcnacylation is increased, such as those occurring in diabetes.  inducible deletion of speg decreased serca2a-thr484 phosphorylation and its oligomerization in the heart.  phospholamban (plb) stoichiometrically regulates the cardiac ca2+ pump (serca2a) in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (sr); but in the nuclear envelope (ne) of cardiomyocytes (cms), the plb to serca2a molar ratio is higher, which highlights our poor understanding of how sr proteins distribute to their functional subcompartments. ||| ",yes
Does TFIIS affect nucleosome positioning?,"their analysis revealed that tfiis generally contributed to nucleosome positioning in both gene promoters and bodies.  this method is useful for detecting subtle alterations in nucleosome positioning produced by lack of tfiis.  co-transcriptional chromatin alterations include subtle changes in nucleosome positioning, like those expected to be elicited by tfiis, which are elusive to detect.  with this improved method, we analyzed the global nucleosomal changes caused by lack of tfiis.  to investigate the contribution of tfiis to the chromatin landscape, we developed a refined nucleosome-mapping method in saccharomyces cerevisiae.  the independent effect of lack of tfiis on nucleosome occupancy and fuzziness supports the existence of alternative chromatin dynamics during transcription elongation.  tfiidδtbp binds ~200 bp of the promoter and changes the dna topology to a larger extent than the nucleosome core particle.  the tata box-binding factor tfiid mediates transcriptional regulation through interactions with various regulatory factors and putative participation in reconfiguration of nucleosomes, utilizing its components, which include tata box-binding protein (tbp) and tbp-associated factors (tafs).  in this study, it was shown that, despite the previously reported nucleosome remodeling ability of nucleoplasmin, the binding of tfiiia to nucleosomal dna cannot be facilitated by this protein.  tfiis acts in the chromatin context, but its contribution to the chromatin landscape has not yet been investigated.  to improve our understanding of tfiis function in vivo, we performed genome-wide location analysis of this factor.  it is unclear how tfiid recognizes promoters in vivo when templates are nucleosome-bound.  in vitro transcription assays suggested that tfiis may affect pol iii start site selection.  tfiis is a transcription elongation factor that has been extensively studied biochemically.  thus, tfiid may be targeted to specific chromatin-bound promoters and may play a role in chromatin recognition.  under normal growth conditions, tfiis was detected on pol ii-transcribed genes, and tfiis occupancy was well correlated with that of pol ii, indicating that tfiis recruitment is not restricted to ntp-depleted cells.  we detected a general increase in nucleosomal fuzziness and more restricted changes in nucleosome occupancy, which concentrated in some gene categories.  recent studies revealed that tfiis has also a role in pol ii transcription initiation.  the general transcription factor tfiid is a core promoter selectivity factor that recognizes dna sequence elements and nucleates the assembly of a pre-initiation complex (pic).  our studies indicate that tfiie also interacts with both subunits of tfiif and with tfiih, a multisubunit basal factor reported to catalyze rna polymerase ii ctd phosphorylation. ||| ",yes
Does TGF-beta play a role in cardiac regeneration after myocardial infarction?,"transforming growth factor (tgf)-beta is a locally generated cytokine involved in healing processes and tissue fibrosis, all relevant for cardiac remodeling and the development of heart failure after myocardial infarction (mi).  transforming growth factor-beta 1 (tgf-β1) is critically involved in cardiac injury, repair and remodeling.  we investigated whether the improvement of cardiac function and remodeling after myocardial infarction (mi) by granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (g-csf) relates to acceleration of the healing process, in addition to myocardial regeneration.  previous studies have demonstrated that transforming growth factor-beta (tgf-beta) can accelerate wound healing, inhibit free radical formation and limit myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury in a variety of experimental models.  tgf-β1 has shown cardioprotective effects in cardiac damage; however, if tgf-β1 can prevent cardiac fibroblast death triggered by ischemia/reperfusion is unknown.  this study aimed to examine the effect of basic fibroblast growth factor (bfgf), which induces angiogenesis and tissue regeneration in ischemic myocardium, to prevent remodeling after surgical ventricular restoration (svr) using a rat ischemic cardiomyopathy model.  transforming growth factor-β (tgf-β) is known for its role in ventricular remodeling, inflammatory response, cell survival, and apoptosis.  anti-tgf-beta treatment before or after coronary artery ligation increases mortality and worsens left ventricular remodeling in mice with non-reperfused mi.  the future therapeutic application and capacity of secreted factors to modulate tissue repair after myocardial infarction relies on the intrinsic potency of factors and on the optimal localization and timing of a combination of signaling factors to stimulate stem cells in their niche to regenerate the infarcted heart.  our results show that tgf-β prevents a/r-induced apoptosis of cardiomyocytes and improves myocardial function in rat hearts injured by i/r.  overall, our data suggest that tgf-β1 prevents cardiac fibroblast apoptosis induced by simulated ischemia-reperfusion through the canonical (smad3) and non canonical (erk1/2 and akt) signaling pathways.  this study investigated the protective effects and molecular mechanisms of tgf-β on myocardial function and cardiomyocyte apoptosis.  furthermore, tgf-β improved i/r-induced myocardial contractile dysfunction.  in the heart, cardiac fibroblasts play a critical role in healing post myocardial infarction.  alongside pro-survival and anti-inflammatory properties, these regenerative roles, via epdcs, markedly expand the range of therapeutic benefits of tβ4 to sustain and repair the myocardium after ischemic damage.  these results demonstrate that a large dose of tgf-beta 1 given before ischemia fails to attenuate myocardial stunning in the open-chest dog, suggesting that this growth factor does not exert protective effects in the setting of reversible myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury.  recent studies suggest that g-csf prevents cardiac remodeling following myocardial infarction (mi) likely through regeneration of the myocardium and coronary vessels.  efficient cardiac regeneration postinfarction (mi) requires the replacement of lost cardiomyocytes, formation of new coronary vessels and appropriate modulation of the inflammatory response.  fibroblast growth factor 2 (fgf2) is cardioprotective in in vivo models of myocardial infarction; however, whether fgf2 has a protective role in in vivo ischemia-reperfusion (ir) injury, a model that more closely mimics acute myocardial infarction in humans, is not known.  we focus on signaling factors known for their mobilizing and chemotactic abilities (sdf-1, g-csf, scf, il-8, vegf), signaling factors that are expressed after myocardial infarction involved in the patho-physiological healing process (tnf-alpha, il-8, il-10, hif-1alpha, vegf, g-csf) and signaling factors that are involved in cardiogenesis and neo-angiogenesis (vegf, epo, tgf-beta, hgf, hif-1alpha, il-8). ||| ",yes
Does TRIM37 gene mutation causes Mulibrey nanism?,"trim37 gene mutations cause mulibrey (muscle-liver-brain-eye) nanism, a severe growth disorder with prenatal onset.  mulibrey nanism is an autosomal recessive growth disorder caused by mutations in the trim37 gene encoding a protein of unknown function.  mutations in the trim37 gene underlie mulibrey nanism (muscle-liver-brain-eye nanism), a rare monogenic developmental disorder characterized by severe growth failure, characteristic dysmorphic features, cardiopathy, failure of sexual maturation, and metabolic syndrome.  mulibrey nanism is a rare growth disorder of prenatal onset caused by mutations in the trim37 gene, which encodes a ring-b-box-coiled-coil protein.  mulibrey nanism (mul) is an autosomal recessive disease caused by mutations in the trim37 gene encoding the peroxisomal trim37 protein of unknown function.  mulibrey nanism (mul) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder with severe primordial growth retardation and multiorgan involvement, caused by mutations in trim37.  mutations in trim37 underlie mulibrey nanism, a rare autosomal recessively inherited disorder with severe growth failure of prenatal onset, constrictive pericardium, hepatomegaly and characteristic dysmorphic features.  mutations in trim37 encoding a tripartite motif (trim, ring-b-box-coiled-coil)-family protein underlie mulibrey nanism.  mulibrey nanism (mul) is a rare inherited disease caused by genetic defects affecting peroxisomal trim37 protein.  these findings are in agreement with the clinical manifestations of mulibrey nanism and provide a basis for the future analysis of trim37 knock-out mice.  mulibrey nanism (muscle-liver-brain-eye nanism; mul) is an autosomal recessively transmitted disease characterized by severe growth delays of prenatal onset caused by mutations in the trim37 gene.  trim37 is an e3 ubiquitin ligase mutated in mulibrey nanism, a disease with impaired organ growth and increased tumor formation.  our study unveils a positive role of trim37 in regulating the mtorc1-tfeb axis and provides mechanistic insights into the pathogenesis of mulibrey nanism, as well as potential therapeutic treatment.  these findings suggest that trim37 acts as a trim domain-dependent e3 ubiquitin ligase and imply defective ubiquitin-dependent degradation of an as-yet-unidentified target protein in the pathogenesis of mulibrey nanism.  mulibrey (muscle-liver-brain-eye) syndrome (mul) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the tripartite motif (trim)37 gene, encoding for trim37 a member of the trim e3 ubiquitin ligase protein family.  in conclusion, inherited biallelic inactivation of trim37 (mulibrey nanism) predisposes to both mesenchymal and epithelial ovarian tumors and dysregulation of trim37 may also be involved in the pathogenesis of sporadic fibrothecomas.  it is caused by recessive mutations in the trim37 gene encoding for the peroxisomal trim37 protein with ubiquitin-ligase activity.  taken together, this molecular evidence unequivocally indicates that trim37 is located in the peroxisomes, and mulibrey nanism thus can be classified as a new peroxisomal disorder.  mulibrey nanism is an autosomal recessive prenatal-onset growth disorder characterized by dysmorphic features, cardiomyopathy, and hepatomegaly.  to investigate the possible involvement of trim37 alterations in the pathogenesis of sporadic fibrothecomas, we analyzed the trim37 cdna for mutations and alternatively spliced transcripts and trim37 expression in fibrothecomas of women without mulibrey nanism. ||| ",yes
Does TUC.338 inhibit colorectal cancer?,"alpha-blockers may prevent colorectal cancer.  colorectal cancer has been found to be attenuated either with prophylactic manipulation of gut microbiome with probiotics or celecoxib, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug mainly by suppressing early pro-carcinogenic markers in various experimental studies.  these observations provided novel evidence that bx357664 might serve as a tumor suppressor and a potential therapeutic target in the treatment of colorectal cancer in the clinic.  the results demonstrated that trail significantly suppressed the growth of colorectal tumor cells in a dose-dependent manner (0.5-2.5 mg/ml) and also promoted colon tumor cell death.  anti-tumor necrosis factor agents (anti-tnf) aim to reduce chronic colonic inflammation and may lower the risk of colorectal cancer (crc), but the impact of anti-tnf exposure has not yet been assessed in population-based cohort studies.  chemotherapy with fluorouracil and folinic acid could improve survival of patients with stage ii colorectal cancer, although the absolute improvements are small: assuming 5-year mortality without chemotherapy is 20%, the relative risk of death seen here translates into an absolute improvement in survival of 3.6% (95% ci 1.0-6.0).  in light of laboratory data indicating that ssris may inhibit colon cancer and one previous epidemiologic study that also observed a decreased risk, further investigation of the effect of ssris on the risk of colorectal cancer is warranted.  a retrospective case-controlled analysis was performed to identify drug candidates in the current use that may prevent colorectal cancer, outside of aspirin.  colorectal cancer (crc) is the third most common cancer worldwide.  aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs reduced the incidence of colorectal cancers and related mortality by 30% to 60% as well as the incidence of colonic adenomas.  numerous evidences indicate that aspirin usage causes a significant reduction in colorectal cancer.  we assessed the association of colorectal cancer risk with ssri and tricyclic antidepressant use in our hospital-based case control surveillance study.  a previous epidemiologic study reported a 30% reduced risk of colorectal cancer among users of high doses of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (ssris).  patients with ulcerative colitis (uc) are at increased risk of colorectal cancer.  putative colorectal cancer preventative agents were identified, including aspirin, vitamin d, vitamin b, vitamin c, vitamin e, xanthine oxidase inhibitor, alpha-blockers, angiotensin receptor blocker, nateglinide, probiotics, thienopyridine, folic acid, nitrovasodilators, bisphosphonates, calcium channel blockers, steroids, and statins (p < 0.05).  colorectal cancer is the third leading cause of cancer-related mortality and a significant public health problem in the united states.  furthermore, the benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy for high-risk stage ii colorectal cancer will be investigated.  in conclusion, trail treatment significantly inhibited the growth and aggressiveness of colon tumors by inducing apoptosis via the exogenous apoptosis pathway, which suggests that trail may be a potential anticancer agent for colon carcinoma therapy.  the odds ratio for regular use of tricyclic antidepressants was 0.77 (95% ci 0.52-1.16) we found an association of reduced risk of colorectal cancer with regular use of ssris.  doxazosin also decreased tumorigenesis in an aom/dss mouse colorectal cancer model. ||| ",no
Does Uc.160 promote cancer?,"analyses of various types of cancers revealed that, in europeans, the -160aa homozygote was associated with an increased risk of urothelial cancer, carriers of -160a were at increased risk of lung and prostate cancers, and carriers of -160a with gastric cancer were found to suffer a significantly increased risk, whereas their asian counterparts seemed to be tolerant.  we assessed 160 tumors for genome-wide copy number alterations and mutation in genes implicated in uc.  because the significance of this polymorphism to cancer risk has been recognized, there are increasing studies investigating -160c/a in different types of cancers and ethnic populations.  urothelial bladder cancer (ubc) is a common genitourinary malignancy, accounting for more than 160.000 deaths per year worldwide.  using fixed- and random-effects models, the -160aa homozygote was more susceptible to urothelial cancer compared with the -160ca heterozygote.  the -160aa homozygote plays a protective role for europeans who develop colorectal cancer.  recent studies have implicated e-cadherin-160c/a single-nucleotide polymorphism (snp) in susceptibility to and early onset of some cancers.  publication bias, subgroup, and sensitivity analyses were also performed, which showed that -160a allele carriers, compared with noncarriers, had about a 17-19% increased risk of several invasive/metastatic tumors.  a meta-analysis indicated that the -160a allele of e-cadherin provides a higher risk for the development of prostate and urothelial cancers and a protective role for colorectal cancer in an ethnicity-dependent manner.  there are approximately 160,000 new cases of colon cancer every year in the united states.  in conclusion, this study identifies muc2 and muc6 expression as markers of ubc with less aggressive behavior and useful predictors of better survival.  no evidence was found that the -160a allele predisposed its carriers to breast, colorectal, or esophageal cancers.  these findings indicate that -160a of the e-cadherin gene is emerging as a low-penetrance tumor susceptibility allele for the development of gastric, lung, prostate, and urothelial cancers.  to assess susceptibility of -160a allele carriers to seven types of cancers, the authors conducted a comprehensive meta-analysis, up to november 2006, of 26 case-control studies comprising 7,042 cases and 7,011 controls.  © 2017 american cancer society.  additionally, the -160a allele is an ethnicity-dependent risk factor for prostate and colorectal cancers.  kaplan-meier analyses showed that expression of muc2 and muc6 in ubc was significantly associated with better overall survival of the patients (p < 0.001, respectively).  the -160c/a polymorphism (rs16260) of e-cadherin, a tumor repressor gene, has been shown to be a tumor susceptibility allele for various types of cancers.  this study identified 161 incident oropharyngeal cancer (opc) cases diagnosed at the university of pittsburgh (2003-2013) with pretreatment serum.  however, there is still uncertainty about the level of risk for a variety of cancers. ||| ",no
Does Vitamin D induce  autophagy?,"this review focuses on the role and mechanisms of vitamin d in autophagy and the regulation of intestinal inflammation.  considerable data indicate a role for vitamin d in the activation of autophagy, an intracellular renewal system that maintains homeostasis by eliminating large protein aggregates and damaged organelles.  vitamin d activates autophagy through a genomic and non-genomic signaling pathway to influence a wide variety of physiological functions of different body organs along with bone health and calcium metabolism.  here, the role of autophagy, the cellular self-degradation process, in vitamin d-dependent function is documented in different cellular settings and discussed the molecular aspects for treating chronic inflammatory, infectious diseases, and cancer.  increasing vitamin d levels in the human body through timely exposure to sunlight or vitamin d supplements could activate autophagy as part of the homeostasis mechanism to prevent multiple human diseases and aging-associated dysfunctions.  furthermore, vitamin d and its receptor regulate autophagy signaling to control inflammation and host immunity by activating antimicrobial defense mechanisms.  vitamin d has been revealed as a potent anticancer agent and induces autophagy to increase the response to radiation and chemotherapeutic drugs for potential cancer therapy.  in this study, we will explain the mechanism of vitamin d regulating inflammation and autophagy in aspergillus fumigatus infected lungs.  vitamin d shows promise for the prevention and amelioration of pathologic responses in ibd, an effect that is mediated, at least in part, by the induction and modulation of autophagy.  however, few studies have shown that vitamin d regulates inflammation and autophagy in aspergillus fumigatus infected lungs.  as the active form of vitamin d3, 1α,25-(oh)2-d3 promotes receptor activator for nuclear factor-κb ligand (rankl)-induced autophagy in osteoclast precursors (ocps).  vitamin d deficiency is implicated in autoimmune disease.  additionally, 1,25(oh)2 d3 -induced autophagy appeared to play a role in anti-inflammation and lipid metabolism modulation in the liver.  our results showed that 1α,25-(oh)2-d3 directly decreased ocp autophagy while significantly enhancing the ability of rankl to promote ocp autophagy.  the autophagic flux and tnf-α, il-1β, il-6 and lc3bii in vitamin d group were significantly lower than those in vitamin d deficiency group.  the protective effects of 1,25(oh)2 d3 -mediated autophagy against lipid accumulation were abolished by 3-ma.  this study aimed to determine whether 1,25(oh)2 d3 can attenuate hepatic steatosis by inducing autophagy.  inhibition of 1,25(oh)2 d3 -induced autophagy mediated by 3-ma blocked the protective effects of 1,25(oh)2 d3 on hepatic steatosis.  vitamin d deficiency has been reported in some autoimmune disorders.  inhibition of p53 increased dha-induced autophagy and prevention of p53 degradation significantly led to the attenuation of dha-induced autophagy, suggesting that dha-induced autophagy is mediated by p53. ||| ",yes
Does Yersinia pestis causes a respiratory infection?,"yersinia pestis causes the fatal respiratory disease pneumonic plague.  yersinia pestis, a psychrotrophic pathogen capable of growth at refrigeration temperatures, can cause pharyngeal and gastrointestinal plague in humans that consume contaminated foods.  this review discusses yersinial virulence factors, mechanisms of infection, and host responses in addition to the current state of surveillance, detection, and prevention of yersiniosis.  yersinia pestis is the causative agent of plague, a disease that can manifest as either bubonic or pneumonic plague.  yersiniosis is primarily caused by yersinia enterocolitica and less frequently by yersinia pseudotuberculosis.  yersinia pestis is the causative agent of bubonic plague.  following inhalation, yersinia pestis rapidly colonizes the lung to establish infection during primary pneumonic plague.  yersinia enterocolitica is a zoonotic agent that causes gastrointestinal disease in humans, as well as reactive arthritis and erythema nodosum.  the third pathogenic yersinia, yersinia enterocolitica, also causes gastroenteritis but is distantly related to y. pestis and y. pseudotuberculosis.  evidence indicates that y. pestis evolved from yersinia pseudotuberculosis, an enteric pathogen that normally causes a relatively mild disease.  however, there are studies indicating that y. pestis invades and causes systemic infection from ingestive and aerogenic routes of infection.  yersinia pestis, a gram-negative bacterium and the etiologic agent of plague, has evolved from yersinia pseudotuberculosis, a cause of a mild enteric disease.  yersinia pestis is the aetiological agent of plague, a disease of humans that has potentially devastating consequences.  yersinia pestis, the plague bacillus, has an exceptional pathogenicity for humans.  y. pestis is a recently derived clone of the pathogenic species yersinia pseudotuberculosis, but is more associated with human infection.  yersinia pestis, the causative agent of plague, is a recently evolved clone of the enteropathogenic bacterium yersinia pseudotuberculosis.  yersinia secretes virulence factors to subvert critical pathways in the host cell.  y. pestis recently evolved from the gastrointestinal pathogen y. pseudotuberculosis; however, it is not known at what point y. pestis gained the ability to induce a fulminant pneumonia.  yersinia enterocolitica is a facultative intracellular pathogen and a causative agent of yersiniosis, which can be contracted by ingestion of contaminated food.  yersiniosis is a food-borne illness that has become more prevalent in recent years due to human transmission via the fecal-oral route and prevalence in farm animals. ||| ",yes
Does a linker histone exist in the yeast genome?,"in this report we describe the presence of histone h1 in yeast.  as an approach to assess linker histone function, we engineered a cdna encoding xenopus laevis histone h5 (xlh5), into the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae, which lacks any known proteins homologous to linker histones.  the existence of histone h1 in the yeast, saccharomyces cerevisiae, has long been debated.  in virtually all eukaryotic organisms, linker dna between nucleosomes is associated with a histone termed linker histone or histone h1.  saccharomyces cerevisiae encodes a single linker histone, hho1p, with two globular domains.  in saccharomyces cerevisiae, the linker histone hho1 is involved in dna repair.  biochemical studies to date have not been able to identify the linker histone h1 protein in the budding yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae.  the putative linker histone in saccharomyces cerevisiae, hho1p, has two regions of sequence (gi and gii) that are homologous to the single globular domains of linker histones h1 and h5 in higher eukaryotes.  in this study, we used a combination of genetic and genomic approaches to explore the regulation of linker histone binding in the yeast, saccharomyces cerevisiae we found that increased expression of hho1, the yeast linker histone, resulted in a severe growth defect, despite only subtle changes in chromatin structure.  here, we show in yeast, that the presence of yeast linker histone hho1p represses expression of a pol ii transcribed gene (met15) embedded in the rdna.  however, little is known about the role of the linker histone.  in saccharomyces cerevisiae, hho1 encodes a putative linker histone with very significant homology to histone h1.  collectively, these results suggest that histone acetylation negatively regulates linker histone binding in s. cerevisiae and other organisms and provide important insight into how chromatin structure is regulated and maintained to both facilitate and repress transcription.  in higher eukaryotes, multiple variants of linker histone h1 exist but their involvement in the dna damage response is unknown.  linker histones play a fundamental role in shaping chromatin structure, but how their interaction with chromatin is regulated is not well understood.  consistent with this, genome-wide analysis of linker histone occupancy revealed an inverse correlation with histone tail acetylation in both yeast and mouse embryonic stem cells.  a., and storms, r. k. (1997) yeast 13, 151-161), although there is no biochemical evidence that shows that hho1p is, indeed, yeast histone h1.  while there is indication that the budding yeast version of histone h1 (hho1) contributes to regulation of chromatin structure and certain chromatin-related processes, such as dna double-strand break repair, cells lacking hho1 are healthy and display subtle phenotypes.  ypl127c, a gene encoding a protein with a high degree of similarity to histone h1 from other species was sequenced as part of the contribution of the montreal yeast genome sequencing group to chromosome xvi.  based on these findings, we suggest that linker histone hho1p has a limited role in transcriptional regulation and that the dynamically exchanging linker histone may be evicted from chromatin by transcriptional activity. ||| ",yes
Does a selective sweep increase genetic variation?,"selective sweep is a phenomenon of reduced variation at presumably neutrally evolving sites (hitchhikers) in the genome that is caused by the spread of a selected allele at a linked focal site, and is widely used to test for action of positive selection.  a selective sweep is the result of strong positive selection driving newly occurring or standing genetic variants to fixation, and can dramatically alter the pattern and distribution of allelic diversity in a population.  we have demonstrated this possibility in relation to ancient selective sweep for modern human-specific changes and ongoing selective sweep for local population-specific changes.  the allele frequency of a neutral variant in a population is pushed either upward or downward by directional selection on a linked beneficial mutation (""selective sweeps"").  this process, known as ""selective sweep,"" was studied by comparing molecular variation between the polymorphic in(2l)t inversion and the standard chromosome.  classic selective sweeps occur when positive selection increases a variant's frequency from low to high in a population, and underlie some long-studied human characteristics such as variation in skin, hair or eye colour.  adaptive alleles may rise in frequency as a consequence of positive selection, creating a pattern of decreased variation in the neighboring loci, known as a selective sweep.  the frequency of the favored allele increases in the population and due to genetic hitchhiking the neighboring linked variation diminishes, creating so-called selective sweeps.  population-level sequencing data have enabled discoveries of selective sweeps associated with genes involved in recent adaptations in many species.  adaptation from standing genetic variation or recurrent de novo mutation in large populations should commonly generate soft rather than hard selective sweeps.  dominance can affect sweep patterns in outcrossers if the derived variant originates from either a single novel allele, or from recurrent mutation.  by identifying ""sweeping haplotypes (shs)"" that putatively carry beneficial alleles and are increasing (or have increased) rapidly in frequency, and surveying the geographic distribution of sh frequencies, we can indirectly infer how selective sweeps unfold in time and thus which modes of positive selection underlie those sweeps.  in the case of a hard selective sweep, a single adaptive haplotype rises to high population frequency, whereas multiple adaptive haplotypes sweep through the population simultaneously in a soft sweep, producing distinct patterns of genetic variation in the vicinity of the selected site.  as a result, 2 characteristic traits of selective sweeps--the reduction of variation and the departure from selective neutrality in haplotype tests--show a bimodal pattern.  in contrast to a hard selective sweep, in which a single adaptive haplotype rises to high population frequency, in a soft selective sweep multiple adaptive haplotypes sweep through the population simultaneously, producing distinct patterns of genetic variation in the vicinity of the adaptive site.  we assess approaches for large-scale association of classic sweep candidate variants to phenotypes and selective forces, test these on the gold standards, and discuss the standards of evidence needed to adequately understand a selective sweep.  however, positive selection may often proceed via ""soft sweeps"" acting on mutations already present within a population.  we consider how arbitrary dominance and inbreeding via self-fertilization affect hard and soft sweep signatures.  we examined the evidence for classic sweeps in resequencing data from 179 human genomes.  here, we develop a statistical test based on a measure of haplotype homozygosity (h12) that is capable of detecting both hard and soft sweeps with similar power. ||| ",no
Does a tonsillectomy affect the patient's voice?,"in this report, we examined the change in pharyngeal size and acoustic feature of voice after tonsillectomy.  speech parameters were assessed before and after tonsillectomy.  therefore, we designed a study to determine whether adult tonsillectomy altered the resonance characteristics of the vocal tract in any way and whether these changes were transient or permanent.  previous reports have warned that tonsillectomy or uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (uppp) may alter patients' speech by increasing the amount of nasal resonance as well as by changing voice timbre due to enlargement of the vocal tract.  controversy exists over whether tonsillectomy will affect speech in patients with known velopharyngeal insufficiency (vpi), particularly in those with cleft palate.  the purpose of this study was to quantify the effects of tonsillectomy (with or without adenoidectomy) on perceptual speech characteristics, aerodynamic measures, and endoscopic descriptions of velopharyngeal function in a clinical population.  anecdotal evidence suggests that tonsillectomy has no deleterious consequences on a person's voice under normal vocal demand.  in this study, tonsillectomy in patients with vpi did not significantly alter speech intelligibility or velopharyngeal competence.  however, whether the enlarged dimensions of the oropharynx after tonsillectomy impair the quality of a professional voice user remains unclear.  the authors wondered if tonsillectomy could affect snoring, no matter what the age and the indication for surgery.  is the patient's tonsillar enlargement due to infection?  although there was a tendency for a decrease in f3, tonsillectomy did not appear to change the acoustical features of the japanese vowels remarkably.  the aim of this study was to determine the relation between snoring and tonsillectomy.  tonsillectomy is a commonly performed surgical procedure worldwide; however, the possible long-term consequences have not been fully explored.  altering the dimensions of the oropharynx after tonsillectomy causes the first formant to rise but has no effect on the third and fourth formants.  tonsillectomy was performed on a patient with a history of frequent tonsillitis.  the authors conclude that tonsillectomy does not reduce the likelihood of becoming a snorer.  tonsillectomy is a commonly performed and relatively safe surgical procedure.  to determine the effect of tonsillectomy in patients with chronic/recurrent acute tonsillitis.  what are the cause and course of tonsillitis? ||| ",yes
Does administration of triiodothyronine improve outcome following coronary artery bypass grafting?,"raising serum triiodothyronine concentrations in patients undergoing coronary-artery bypass surgery increases cardiac output and lowers systemic vascular resistance, but does not change outcome or alter the need for standard postoperative therapy.  triiodothyronine (t3) administration after cardiopulmonary bypass has been shown to significantly improve cardiac performance.  a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study was undertaken to further define the effect of triiodothyronine on hemodynamics and outcome after coronary artery bypass grafting.  parenteral triiodothyronine given after crossclamp removal during elective coronary artery bypass grafting significantly improved postoperative ventricular function, reduced the need for treatment with inotropic agents and mechanical devices, and decreased the incidence of myocardial ischemia.  subjects receiving triiodothyronine demonstrated a significantly lower incidence of postoperative myocardial ischemia (4% vs 18%, p =.007) and pacemaker dependence (14% vs 25%, p =.013).  we investigated whether the perioperative administration of triiodothyronine (liothyronine sodium) enhances cardiovascular performance in high-risk patients undergoing coronary-artery bypass surgery.  the purpose of this study was to determine the influence of triiodothyronine (t3) on cardiac functional recovery after ischemia in a dose-dependent manner.  during and after cardiopulmonary bypass, serum triiodothyronine concentrations decline transiently, which may contribute to postoperative hemodynamic dysfunction.  despite similar baseline characteristics, patients randomized to triiodothyronine had a higher cardiac index and lower inotropic requirements after the operation.  this study evaluated the effect of oral triiodothyronine (t(3)) replacement therapy, starting on the day of the surgery, on thyroid hormone concentrations and clinical outcome in high-risk patients undergoing valvular heart surgery.  clinical studies have demonstrated improved myocardial recovery after severe ischemia in response to acute triiodothyronine (t3) treatment.  triiodothyronine administration in vivo most likely has little direct effect on the tone of human vascular smooth muscle, particularly coronary artery bypass conduits.  pre-clinical animal studies have shown that triiodothyronine (t3) replacement therapy improves cardiac contractile function after myocardial infarction (mi).  there is strong clinical and experimental evidence that altered thyroid homeostasis negatively affects survival in cardiac patients, but a negative effect of the low triiodothyronine (t3) syndrome on the outcome of coronary artery bypass grafting (cabg) has not been demonstrated.  triiodothyronine also increases efficiency in the stressed heart.  this study suggests that triiodothyronine supplementation significantly enhances postischemic left ventricular functional recovery and that this recovery is due to mechanisms other than enhanced availability of myocardial high-energy phosphates.  the patients' preoperative serum triiodothyronine concentrations were normal (mean  value, 81 +/- 22 ng per deciliter ), and they decreased by 40 percent (p < 0.001) 30 minutes after the onset of cardiopulmonary bypass.  cardiopulmonary bypass results in a euthyroid sick state, and recent evidence suggests that perioperative triiodothyronine (t3) supplementation may have hemodynamic benefits.  the present study was conducted to ascertain the relationship between perioperative free triiodothyronine and free tetraiodothyronine (ft4) levels and postoperative adverse outcomes after heart transplantation (htx).  triiodothyronine-treated patients had a lower incidence of atrial fibrillation (24% versus 46%; p = 0.009), and fewer required cardioversion (0 versus 6; p = 0.012) or anticoagulation (2 versus 10; p = 0.013) during hospitalization. ||| ",no
Does amiodarone affect thyroid hormone receptors in the myocardium?,"amiodarone, a powerful antiarrhythmic drug, may exert its effect by antagonism of the thyroid hormone, probably at the receptor level.  in conclusion, our study confirms that the antiarrhythmic action of amiodarone may be (at least partially) mediated by its action on thyroid hormone metabolism, and may justify the hypothesis that an altered peripheral metabolism of thyroid hormones may play a role in the pathogenesis of complex ventricular arrhythmias.  we tested the hypothesis that the antiarrhythmic effect of amiodarone might be mediated by its effect on the metabolism of thyroid hormones.  amiodarone, an iodine-containing antiarrhythmic drug, has been reported to interfere with thyroid function and thyroid hormone metabolism.  amiodarone is an anti-arrhythmic drug that commonly affects the thyroid, causing hypothyroidism or thyrotoxicosis.  amiodarone, an antiarrhythmic agent, is also known to have important effects on the peripheral metabolism of thyroid hormones; the relationship between these two effects of the drug, however, is not well established.  this study examined whether or not the electrophysiological effect of amiodarone on the heart is mediated through its action on thyroxine metabolism.  amiodarone treatment of the rat was used as a model to determine the influence of the drug on thyroid hormone-regulated gene expression in the myocardium and liver; interactions between amiodarone and thyroid status were examined in hypothyroid and tri-iodothyronine (t3)-treated animals.  this review evaluates the hypothesis that the cardiac effects of amiodarone can be explained-at least partly-by the induction of a local 'hypothyroid-like condition' in the heart.  although amiodarone is regarded as a highly effective anti-arrhythmic agent, its use may lead to alterations in thyroid gland function and/or thyroid hormone metabolism, partly because of its rich iodine content.  treatment with the antiarrhythmic agent amiodarone results in alterations in thyroid hormone metabolism, and can induce either hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism (amiodarone-associated thyrotoxicosis, aat).  these results support a thyroid hormone-dependent action of amiodarone.  amiodarone is a potent new antiarrhythmic drug that has multiple effects on thyroid function, including inhibition of extrathyroidal triiodothyronine production and rarely, iodine-induced hypothyroidism.  prevalence of amiodarone-induced thyroid dysfunction.  since both drugs had roughly similar effects on thyroid hormone metabolism but different ones on the ecg, our results provide indirect evidence against the hypothesis that the antiarrhythmic effects of amiodarone are mediated through a decrease in the serum t3 presented to the peripheral tissues.  amiodarone, an iodinated benzofuran derivative, has electrophysiologic effects on cardiac muscle akin to those of hypothyroidism.  the aim of this study was to investigate whether amiodarone affects the levels of thyroid hormone receptor (tr) messenger rna (mrna) subtypes in mouse hearts.  evidence supporting the hypothesis comprises the observation that amiodarone exerts an inhibitory effect on the binding of t3 to thyroid hormone receptors (tr) alpha-1 and beta-1 in vitro, and on the expression of particular t3-dependent genes in vivo.  a number of the cardiovascular effects of amiodarone resemble those of hypothyroidism, prompting examination of the relationship between the actions of the drug and thyroid hormones.  amiodarone is used in patients with arrhythmias, but thyroid dysfunction  is a common adverse effect. ||| ",yes
Does armodafinil improve fatigue of glioma patients?,"we evaluated whether armodafinil, a wakefulness-promoting medication, improves fatigue in glioma patients undergoing rt.  we investigated whether armodafinil could reduce cancer-related fatigue in mm patients.  while treatment was well-tolerated, an 8-week course of armodafinil did not improve fatigue or qol in glioma patients undergoing rt in this pilot study.  we hypothesized that armodafinil (a wakefulness-promoting drug known to reduce fatigue and increase cognitive function in breast cancer patients receiving chemotherapy) would result in reduced fatigue and sleepiness for patients receiving brain rt.  armodafinil is a psychostimulant that might help cancer-related fatigue in patients with hgg.  further studies are needed to determine whether pharmacologic treatment improves fatigue in glioma patients undergoing rt.  armodafinil is a drug known to promote wakefulness, which is related to modafinil, a compound that improves fatigue in some cancer patients treated with chemotherapeutic agents.  to determine whether armodafinil reduces fatigue in patients with hgg and moderate-to-severe fatigue.  this study examined whether alleviation of fatigue with armodafinil in a placebo-controlled double-blind 4-week trial had an effect on cognitive function among those with and without mild neuropsychological impairment at baseline.  fatigue is common among glioma patients undergoing radiotherapy (rt) and impacts quality of life (qol).  this double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial evaluated the efficacy of armodafinil in mm patients with evidence of moderate fatigue.  these preliminary results suggest a therapeutic effect of armodafinil on fatigue affecting quality of life during menopause, and a potential benefit for other menopause-related symptoms.  in this randomized multicenter, phase 3, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial, adults with hgg and moderate-to-severe fatigue who were clinically stable at least 4 weeks after completing radiation therapy were randomized to receive armodafinil daily (150 mg or 250 mg) or placebo over 8 weeks.  the results of this randomized clinical trial found no meaningful benefit of using treatment with armodafinil to reduce cancer-related fatigue in patients with hgg.  a phase ii, multi-institutional, placebo-controlled randomized trial assessed feasibility of armodafinil 150 mg/day in participants receiving brain rt, from whom we obtained estimates of variability for fatigue, sleepiness, qol, cognitive function, and treatment effect.  nearly 96% of patients with high-grade glioma (hgg) report moderate-to-severe fatigue.  fatigue is a well-known effect of antiangiogenic therapies (aats) of cancer.  armodafinil 150 mg/day was well tolerated in primary brain tumor patients undergoing rt with good compliance.  armodafinil did not reduce depressive symptoms in the absence of improved energy, but of those patients with an axis i depressive disorder at study entry whose energy improved, 82% experienced improved mood as well.  women (aged 40-65 y) experiencing menopause-related fatigue received open-label armodafinil therapy (up to 150 mg/d) for 4 weeks. ||| ",no
Does burning mouth syndrome preferentially affect post-mepopausal women?,"burning mouth symptoms are known to occur predominantly in postmenopausal women.  male and premenopausal female patients with burning mouth symptoms showed different characteristics compared with typical postmenopausal female patients.  burning mouth syndrome is a complex disorder of unclear etiology that is most prevalent in perimenopausal women.  to identify possible clinical differences between male, premenopausal, and postmenopausal female patients with burning mouth symptoms.  burning mouth syndrome (bms) is a common disorder frequently affecting women past the 5th decade of age.  burning mouth syndrome--bms (also known as glossodynia, glossalgia, glossopyrosis, or oral dysesthesia)--primarily affects middle-aged women.  burning mouth syndrome (bms) is a chronic disorder which is affecting mostly postmenopausal women and is characterized by burning symptoms in the oral cavity on the clinically healthy oral mucosa.  burning mouth syndrome (bms) is a chronic oral pain syndrome that primarily affects peri- and postmenopausal women.  various oral symptoms, including xerostomia and burning mouth syndrome, may occur in menopausal women.  a total of 22 male patients (no age limit) and 19 relatively younger premenopausal female patients (age: ≤45 years) with a burning sensation in the mouth without any visible signs of oral mucosal diseases were included in the experimental groups.  burning mouth syndrome (bms) is a chronic pain condition that most commonly affects postmenopausal women older than 50 years of age.  burning mouth syndrome (bms) is a chronic pain disorder, more common in peri and postmenopausal females, with a varied symptomatology.  sixty burning mouth patients (postmenopausal females, age: ≥50 years) without oral mucosal diseases were included as a typical older postmenopausal group for comparison.  burning mouth syndrome (bms) is a chronic, intraoral burning sensation seen mainly in middle-aged and post-menopausal females, without identifiable oral lesions or abnormal laboratory findings, but often associated with psychogenic disorders such as depression.  the burning mouth syndrome is poorly understood and mainly affects postmenopausal women.  osc in perimenopausal women include xerostomia, taste disturbance and burning mouth.  the number of menopausal symptoms was significantly higher, and volume of unstimulated saliva was significantly lower in participants with xerostomia, taste disturbance, burning mouth or 2osc than in those without these characteristics.  burning mouth syndrome (bms) is a chronic condition characterized by burning of the oral mucosa, with or without dysgeusia and xerostomia, in the setting of no underlying systemic disease or identifiable abnormalities on physical examination or laboratory testing.  burning mouth syndrome (bms) is a chronic disease characterized by burning of the oral mucosa associated with a sensation of dry mouth and/or taste alterations.  burning mouth syndrome (bms) is a chronic condition characterized by a burning sensation of the oral cavity and is often associated with taste disturbances and xerostomia. ||| ",yes
Does cortical spreading depression appear in ischemic penumbra following ischemic stroke?,"spontaneous cortical spreading depression (csd) has been found to occur in the penumbral zone of the brain in rats with focal cerebral ischemia, and has been shown to promote expansion of infarction.  spreading depression-like peri-infarct depolarizations not only characterize but also worsen penumbra conditions in cortical border zones of experimental focal ischemia.  recent studies have shown that the brain ischemic area defined by the map of decreased apparent diffusion coefficient (adc) obtained by diffusion-weighted imaging (dwi) during the first hours of ischemic stroke includes a significant part of ischemic penumbra.  we conclude that in focal ischemia, transient peri-infarct depolarizations emerge not only in cortical but also in striatal gray matter, thereby demonstrating the existence of subcortical zones of ischemic penumbra.  whether lowered apparent diffusion coefficient (adc) values were present in the ischemic penumbra of patients presenting with acute ischemic stroke and were specific to regions of the penumbra that proceeded to infarction was investigated.  cortical spreading depression promotes lesion progression in experimental stroke, and may contribute to the initiation of migraine attacks.  cortical spreading depression (csd) has been observed during the early phase of subarachnoid hemorrhage (sah).  cortical spreading depression (csd) and periinfarct depolarization (pid) have been shown in various experimental models of stroke to cause secondary neuronal damage and infarct expansion.  to determine the relationship between early onset poststroke depression and ischemic stroke lesion location.  depression of electrocorticogram propagating over the cortex surface results in cortical spreading depression (csd), which is probably related to the pathophysiology of stroke, epilepsy, and migraine.  cortical spreading depression (csd) occurrence has been suggested to be associated with seizures, migraine aura, head injury and brain ischemia-infarction.  cortical tissue surrounding acute ischemic infarcts undergoes repetitive spontaneous depolarizations.  nineteen patients with hemispheric stroke of less than 6 hours' onset and with acute scans showing a perfusion lesion greater than a diffusion lesion (ischemic penumbra) were studied.  the concept of ""cortical spreading depression"" following subarachnoid hemorrhage (sah) drastically tends to change the direction of vasospasm research.  prediction of the regions of the ischemic penumbra that are likely to progress to infarction is of great clinical interest.  acute psychosis or other neuropsychiatric symptoms including depression may present in stroke patients and patients with lesions either within the prefrontal or occipital cortices, or in subcortical areas such as the basal ganglia, thalamus, mid-brain, and brainstem.  cortical spreading depression (csd) has been much studied experimentally but never demonstrated unequivocally in human neocortex by direct electrophysiological recording.  the relationship between poststroke depression and ischemic stroke lesion location is controversial.  cortical spreading depolarization (csd), cortical spreading ischemia (csi), and early brain injury are involved in the occurrence of delayed brain ischemia after subarachnoid hemorrhage (sah).  on the basis of these observations, we suggest that the related phenomenon, peri-infarct depolarization, is indeed likely to occur in boundary zones in the ischemic human cerebral cortex. ||| ",yes
Does cucumber lower blood sugar in diabetics?,"curcumin significantly reduced glycosylated hemoglobin (hba1c) in prediabetics (md: -0.9%, 95% ci: -1.7 to -0.1%, p = 0.03).  several lines of evidence suggest that curcumin may play a beneficial role in animal models of diabetes, both by lowering blood glucose levels and by ameliorating the long-term complications of diabetes.  curcumin administration significantly decreased fasting blood glucose and promoted recovery of pancreas function in type 2 diabetes rats.  curcumin was previously reported to exert beneficial effects on diabetes.  this study aimed to assess the effect of curcumin on glycemic control and lipid profile in prediabetes and t2dm.  curcumin has potential value for the treatment of diabetes.  our findings may encourage curcumin supplementation based on its meaningful effect on glycemic control and positive trend on lipid outcomes in prediabetes and t2dm.  several studies highlight curcumin's benefit as a hypoglycemic agent, however; a limited number of reports present the importance of curcumin in improvement of pancreatic islets in diabetes.  the results of the current study indicate that curcumin consumption may reduce diabetes complications through decreasing tg level as well as indicators of inflammation.  curcumin and turmeric extracts significantly reduced blood glucose and creatinine levels, but not urea, and caused an increase in uric acid.  curcumin has a therapeutic potential in treating diabetic kidney disease (dkd) while potential mechanisms underlining this beneficial effect remain to be elucidated.  the aim of this study is evaluation of the effect of nano-curcumin on hba1c, fast blood glucose and lipid profile in diabetic patients.  these findings suggest an hba1c lowering effect for nano-curcumin in type-2 diabetes; also, it is partially decrease in serum ldl-c and bmi.  we recently reported that tetrahydrocurcumin lowered the blood glucose in diabetic rats.  these results suggest that curcumin holds promise as an agent to prevent or treat cns complications in diabetes.  we report that curcumin supplementation reduces diabetes induced alteration of dopamine d1, d2 receptors, transcription factor creb and phospholipase c to near control.  treatment of diabetic rats with curcumin or metformin alone decreased the plasma levels of glucose, triacylglycerol, cholesterol, tbars, and fluorescent ages, as well as increased the activity of pon 1.  this study suggests that curcumin may be a promising agent to alleviate diabetic lung injury and also provides theoretical foundation for the development of diabetes therapy.  anti-inflammatory proprieties of curcumin were proved to be useful in various diseases, including diabetes mellitus.  in this study we examine potential anti-diabetic mechanisms of curcumin, curcumin c3 complex), and tetrahydrocurcuminoids (thc). ||| ",yes
Does d-tubocurarine (d-TC) induces irreversible inhibition of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) at the neuromuscular junction?,"nicotinic antagonists such as tubocurarine affect acetylcholine release from motor nerve terminals at the neuromuscular junction.  the interactions of d-tubocurarine (d-tc) with the ionic channel of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor were studied by biochemical methods in torpedo electric organ membranes and by electrophysiological methods on frog sciatic nerve-sartorius muscle preparation.  d-tubocurarine is a potent competitive antagonist of both the muscle-type nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (achr) and the serotonin type-3 receptor (5ht(3)r).  d-tubocurarine and the alpha-neurotoxins from snake venom are antagonists at the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor.  the effects of low concentrations (nanomolar) of d-tubocurarine (tc) on end-plate potential (epp) and miniature end-plate potential (mepp) amplitude, and quantal transmitter release were examined at the rat neuromuscular junction in an attempt to identify the functional role of nicotinic receptors on the nerve terminal.  analogs of d-tubocurarine were used to determine the individual effects of methylation, stereoisomerization, and halogenation of d-tubocurarine on the affinity for each of the two acetylcholine (ach) binding sites of the torpedo nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (achr) and for the noncompetitive antagonist site.  d-tubocurarine is a potent competitive antagonist of two members of the ligand-gated ion channel family, the muscle-type nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (achr) and serotonin type-3 receptor (5ht3r).  in the present study, a fine ultrastructural localization of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nachr) was attempted, using d-tubocurarine (d-tc), a quaternary ammonium compound binding to nachr.  because of the competitive mechanism of action of tubocurarine, the rate of hydrolysis of acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction may modulate its neuromuscular blocking effect.  a minimum mechanism is proposed in which d-tubocurarine competes for one of the two acetylcholine activating sites and also binds to a noncompetitive site.  it is suggested that d-tc interacts with both the acetylcholine receptor sites as well as its ionic channel sites in closed and open conformations.  1 the rates at which tubocurarine associates with, and dissociates from, the nicotinic receptor, while exerting its classical competitive effect, are still in doubt.  although (+)-tubocurarine (tc) is classically considered to be a competitive antagonist at the neuromuscular junction, kinetic details of the interaction remain unclear.  at low frequencies of nerve stimulation tubocurarine augments acetylcholine release while at high frequencies of nerve stimulation tubocurarine depresses acetylcholine release.  binding of d-tubocurarine to the noncompetitive site does not change the rate of rapid receptor inactivation, whereas binding of d-tubocurarine to the competitive site decreases the rate of rapid inactivation by displacing acetylcholine, in agreement with the observation that d-tubocurarine does not inactivate (desensitize) the e. electricus receptor by itself.  presynaptic effects of d-tubocurarine on neurotransmitter release were examined at the frog neuromuscular junction, using intracellular and extracellular recording techniques.  these results suggest that d-tubocurarine inhibits release of neurotransmitter by affecting a stage in the process of release, which occurs after the entry of ca2+ ions.  d-tubocurarine (dtc) and d-tubocurine acted as antagonists of the dopamine-induced inhibition of adrenergic neurotransmission in the isolated, perfused rabbit ear artery.  it is well established that d-tubocurarine causes fade in neuromuscular transmission during repetitive nerve stimulation but paradoxically there are many reports which indicate that the alpha-neurotoxins do not cause such fade.  we studied the competitive action of tc on the nicotinic receptor at the frog neuromuscular junction using a quantitative analysis of the generation phase of miniature endplate currents (m.e.p.cs) recorded in ringer solution (20 degrees c) under voltage clamp (-90 mv) in the absence or presence of 1-5 microm tc. ||| ",no
Does deflazacort have more side effects than prednisone?,"in general, deflazacort appears to have less effect than prednisone on parameters which may be associated with the development of corticosteroid-induced osteoporosis.  deflazacort has shown similar effects to prednisone, but with a less worrying adverse-effect profile.  deflazacort (dfz) is a synthetic glucocorticoid claimed to have lesser side effects than prednisone.  deflazacort (dfz) is claimed to have fewer adverse bone effects than prednisone (pdn) at doses with equivalent anti-inflammatory activity (5 mg pdn = 6 mg dfz).  when deflazacort first became available last year, the manufacturer claimed that the drug had a lower incidence of steroid-induced unwanted effects compared with prednisolone.  here we discuss whether deflazacort offers any advantages over established corticosteroid therapy.  deflazacort, a synthetic oxazoline derivative of prednisolone, has been suggested as having major advantages over other glucocorticoids, as it is claimed to cause fewer adverse effects at equivalent antiinflammatory potency.  in previous studies, it was shown that deflazacort, depending on the test model used, not only showed considerably more antiinflammatory potency than prednisolone in animals but also caused less deleterious effects on bone mineral metabolism than equivalent amounts of other glucocorticoids in man.  deflazacort is a synthetic glucocorticoid with fewer adverse effects on bone and carbohydrate metabolism than prednisone or beta-methasone.  both short (4 to 6 weeks) and longer term (13 to 52 weeks) studies have shown deflazacort to be as effective as prednisone or methylprednisolone in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.  thus, deflazacort may be associated with less serious metabolic sequelae than prednisone but further well designed long term trials are required to confirm this.  deflazacort (dfz), a derivate of prednisolone, is a poorly soluble drug which has been proposed to have major advantages over other corticosteroids.  the long-term anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive properties and the safety of deflazacort (calcort, cas 14484-47-0) were assessed investigating the effect on clinical symptoms and safety parameters in patients with rheumatoid arthritis compared to prednisone as standard therapy in a randomized double-blind controlled clinical trial.  the acute effects of deflazacort (mdl 458, cas 14484-47-0) and its metabolite, 21-desacetyl-deflazacort, on allergic reactions in animal models were investigated and compared with those of prednisolone.  deflazacort is an oxazoline derivative of prednisolone with anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive activity.  the overall incidence of adverse events in deflazacort recipients (16.5%) is lower than that recorded in patients treated with prednisone (20.5%) or methylprednisolone (32.7%) and similar to that in betamethasone recipients (15.3%).  in a randomized cross-over study we compared the acute effects of deflazacort and prednisolone on serum cortisol, osteocalcin, insulin and blood cells (eosinophils and lymphocytes) in normal subjects.  these findings indicate that while deflazacort and 21-desacetyl-deflazacort have stronger anti-allergic effects than prednisolone, they seem to have little acute effect on mast cell degranulation or on chemical mediators at the receptor site.  deflazacort, an oral synthetic steroid with fewer side effects, has been successfully used in patients after heart transplantation, but a prospective study comparing deflazacort and prednisone in transplant patients is lacking.  deflazacort is a new synthetic glucocorticoid which is an oxazoline derivative of prednisolone. ||| ",no
Does dronedarone  affect  T3 and T4 levels?,"both dronedarone and amiodarone can induce dyslipidemia and increase the levels of tc, ldl-c, and hdl-c, and these effects may be associated with thyroid dysfunction.  thus, we conclude that dronedarone's cytotoxic effect in breast cancer cell lines are independent of thrα or thrα1 antagonism.  dronedarone induced hyperthyroidism at the early stage and hypothyroidism at the late stage whereas amiodarone only caused hypothyroidism.  the antiproliferative and antitumor effects of dronedarone, an fda-approved anti-arrhythmic drug which has been shown to antagonize thrα1, was evaluated in breast cancer cell lines in vitro and in vivo.  in our study, dronedarone demonstrates cytotoxic effects in vitro and in vivo in breast cancer cell lines at doses and concentrations that may be clinically relevant.  however, the effects of dronedarone on lipid metabolism and of both dronedarone and amiodarone on thyroid function and lipid metabolism remain unknown.  during treatment with amiodarone and t3, plasma t3 and free t3 increased and plasma t4, free t4 and rt3 levels decreased; the frequency of vpcs remained low despite shortening of the qtc to values not different from baseline.  both serum t3 and serum t4 levels were decreased by a single 10 mg/kg delta 9-thc injection with maximal decreases at 6 hr post-injection.  in conclusion, dronedarone treatment results in cardioprotection by selectively mimicking hypothyroidism.  serum t3 levels were slightly increased by trh and this increase was also unaffected by delta 9-thc.  however, knockdown of either thrα1 or thrα did not cause substantial anti-proliferative or cytotoxic effects in vitro, nor did it alter the sensitivity to dronedarone.  dronedarone was given in wistar rats (90 mg/kg, once daily (od) for 2 weeks) (dron), while untreated animals served as controls (cont).  we found that both amiodarone and desethylamiodarone cause a decrease in intracellular t3 in all tissues (p less than 0.001), in most tissues an increase in t4 and a greater increase in the rt3 concentration.  analysis of serum th levels showed a reduction of t4 in group p (p = 0.002) at days 2 to 14, while half of the animals also displayed ""low t3"" values (p = 0.012) on day 14.  in view of their different actions on thyroid hormone receptor (tr) isoforms we set out to investigate whether amiodarone (am) and dronedarone (dron) have different and/or component-specific effects on cardiac gene expression.  hypothyroid heart displays a phenotype of cardioprotection against ischemia and this study investigated whether administration of dronedarone, an amiodarone-like compound that has been shown to preferentially antagonize thyroid hormone binding to thyroid hormone receptor alpha1 (tralpha1), results in a similar effect.  characterizing the mechanism of dronedarone's anti-tumor action may facilitate drug repurposing or the development of new anti-cancer agents.  in the present experiments, these effects of t3 on the generation of t3 from t4 were confirmed in both hemipituitaries and homogenates, indicating that they were not due to an effect of t3 on the cellular penetration of the t4 used as substrate.  in a group of 11 patients with affective disorders, tricyclic antidepressants did not alter serum t3 and t4 levels.  both compounds inhibit both deiodination (p less than 0.0001) and t3 production by the thyroid (p less than 0.0001); t4 production was enhanced (p less than 0.05). ||| ",no
Does echinacea increase anaphylaxis risk?,"a woman with atopy experienced anaphylaxis after taking, among other dietary supplements, a commercial extract of echinacea.  regular ingestion of echinacea by up to 5% of surveyed patients with atopy, combined with detection of echinacea-binding ige in atopic subjects (19% by skin testing; 20% with moderate to strong reactivity by rast testing), raises the possibility of severe allergic reactions, even with first-time use, due to cross-reactivity with other structurally similar allergens.  patients with atopy should be cautioned about the risk of developing life-threatening reactions to complementary medicines, including echinacea.  thus, we investigated the prevalence of anaphylaxis and prescription rates of eai in urban and rural areas in korea.  anaphylaxis is a potentially life-threatening allergic reaction.  to assess the benefits and harms of adrenaline (epinephrine) in the treatment of anaphylaxis.  within the overall asthma population, patients at significantly increased risk of anaphylaxis included those with allergic rhinitis or atopic dermatitis, and current users of antihistamines, oral steroids, or antibiotics (compared with nonusers).  3 cases of anaphylaxis due to hypersensitivity to a. simplex are described.  risk of anaphylaxis was greater in the nonsevere asthma (relative risk, 2.07; 95% ci, 1.65-2.60) and severe asthma (relative risk, 3.29; 95% ci, 2.47-3.47) subgroups compared with the no asthma cohort.  exercise-induced anaphylaxis (eia) is defined as the onset of allergic symptoms during, or immediately after, exercise, the clinical signs being various degrees of urticaria, angioedema, respiratory and gastrointestinal signs and even anaphylactic shock.  the annual prevalence of anaphylaxis increased over the 5-year period.  anaphylaxis is the sudden, life-threatening reaction to an antigen.  immunoglobulin e-mediated allergy to drugs and substances used during general anaesthesia as well as non-allergic drug hypersensitivity reactions may account for anaesthesia-induced anaphylaxis.  to report a first case of idiopathic anaphylaxis associated with coryzal symptoms.  in this article we report serious or significant systemic reactions, which are characterized by any of the following symptoms: urticaria, sneezing or nasal obstruction, throat tightness or congestion, wheezing, and shock (bradycardia or hypotension).  we choose to present data on anaphylaxis regarding simulation, mode of exposure to sensitizing agents, pregnancy, exposure to animals, intimate behaviour, psychological stress and other situations.  patients with asthma have a greater risk of anaphylaxis than those without asthma, and the risk is greater in severe than nonsevere asthma.  anaphylaxis incidence rates (per 100,000 person-years) were 21.28 (95% ci, 17.64-25.44) and 50.45 (95% ci, 44.67-56.76) in the no asthma and overall asthma cohorts, respectively.  anaphylaxis is the most severe systemic hypersensitivity reaction, it can be caused by a number of well identified triggers such as foods, drugs, stinging insects and facilitated by predisposing clinical conditions.  main outcome measure perioperative anaphylaxis occurrence. ||| ",yes
Does erythromycin increase risk of hypertrophic pyloric stenosis?,"newborn infants treated with erythromycin may be at risk for developing pyloric stenosis.  a case report has suggested that exposure to erythromycin through breast milk might cause infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis.  macrolide antibiotics, erythromycin, in particular, have been linked to the development of infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (ihps).  erythromycin treatment before 2 weeks of age has been shown to increase the risk of infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (ihps) up to 10 times.  we found no evidence of an increased risk of pyloric stenosis among infants born to mothers exposed to erythromycin during pregnancy.  because erythromycin is known to cross the placenta and is a recommended treatment for chlamydia and other infections in pregnancy, we explored whether erythromycin taken during pregnancy might similarly lead to an increase in risk of pyloric stenosis.  overall, erythromycin exposure was significantly associated with development of ihps .  the use of macrolides during breast-feeding increases the risk of infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis.  this study therefore examined whether macrolides, transmitted via breast milk, increase the risk of infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis in neonates.  evidence suggests an association between early postnatal erythromycin exposure and ihps.  erythromycin, a commonly used antibiotic, has recently emerged as a potential gastrointestinal prokinetic agent.  the safety profile of erythromycin is notable for the frequent occurrence of intolerable gastrointestinal effects.  the aim of this study was to assess the effect and mechanism(s) of action of erythromycin on proximal gastric tone in humans.  our aim was to conduct a systematic review of the evidence of whether post-natal erythromycin exposure is associated with subsequent development of ihps.  in the supine position, however, erythromycin significantly (p = 0.012) decreased esophageal contraction velocity and showed a strong trend (p = 0.059) towards increasing the percentage of peristaltic waves.  erythromycin on oesophageal motility in patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux (gor).  the aim of the study was to investigate the effect of erythromycin on postprandial gastroesophageal reflux in patients with reflux esophagitis.  erythromycin significantly increased lower oesophageal sphincter (los) pressure from 17 +/- 5 to 41 +/- 10 mmhg (p < 0.001), without affecting the postdeglutition relaxation of los.  the prominent gastrokinetic properties of erythromycin have been postulated as the mechanism behind this phenomenon.  however, erythromycin has been reported to increase the prevalence of diarrhea, which may reflect reduced absorption and/or accelerated small intestinal transit. ||| ",yes
Does fibronectin constitute a serum biomarker for Duchenne muscular dystrophy?,"extent of muscle fibrosis contributes to disease severity in muscular dystrophies.  to investigate whether extracellular matrix (ecm) components contribute to the severe fibrosis observed in duchenne muscular dystrophy (dmd) skeletal muscle, we quantitated several ecm components (transcripts and proteins) in primary dmd and control myotube cultures.  we have previously shown that duchenne muscular dystrophy (dmd) can be diagnosed by fetal muscle biopsy and immunohistochemical staining showing the absence of dystrophin.  duchenne muscular dystrophy (dmd), the most severe form of inherited muscular dystrophies, is known to be caused by a deficiency of the protein ""dystrophin"", but the pathophysiologic consequences of this lack have not as yet been elucidated.  duchenne muscular dystrophy, an x-linked recessive neuromuscular disorder due to lack of the protein dystrophin, manifests as progressive muscle degeneration and cardiomyopathy with increased fibrosis.  a deficiency of the protein dystrophin has recently been shown to be the probable cause of duchenne's muscular dystrophy.  we sought to determine the relation between the clinical phenotype and the status of dystrophin in muscle-biopsy specimens from 103 patients with various neuromuscular disorders.  duchenne muscular dystrophy (dmd) is a progressive muscle-wasting disease resulting from lack of the sarcolemmal protein dystrophin.  to determine whether a decrease in matrix degradation contributes to the severe fibrosis seen in duchenne muscular dystrophy (dmd), we quantified rna transcript numbers for the fibrolytic matrix metalloproteinases (mmp)-1 and -2 and their natural tissue inhibitors (timp)-1 and -2 in dmd muscle as well as in pathological and normal controls.  the biochemical assay for dystrophin should prove helpful in delineating myopathies that overlap clinically with duchenne's and becker's dystrophies, and it shows promise as an accurate diagnostic tool.  duchenne muscular dystrophy (dmd) is caused by loss of the structural protein, dystrophin, resulting in muscle fragility.  in duchenne muscular dystrophy muscle, the lack of dystrophin is accompanied by alterations in the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex.  duchenne muscular dystrophy results from the absence of the protein dystrophin and the associated dystrophin - glycoprotein complex, which are thought to provide both structural support and signaling functions for the muscle fiber.  duchenne muscular dystrophy arises due to the lack of the cytoskeletal protein dystrophin.  duchenne muscular dystrophy (dmd) is a genetic condition caused by mutations in the dmd gene leading to muscle degeneration, fatty replacement of muscle cells and fibrosis.  the gene encoding dysferlin was sequenced in patients with suspected dysferlin-deficient muscular dystrophy.  in dystrophinopathies, disease severity is generally related to the extent of muscle fibrosis.  duchenne muscular dystrophy (dmd) is a progressive neuromuscular disease characterized by extensive muscle weakness.  duchenne muscular dystrophy results from loss of the protein dystrophin, which links the intracellular cytoskeletal network with the extracellular matrix, but deficiency in this function does not fully explain the onset or progression of the disease.  duchenne muscular dystrophy (dmd) is characterized by muscle degeneration and structural defects in the neuromuscular synapse that are caused by mutations in dystrophin. ||| ",yes
Does ghrelin play a role in ischemic stroke?,"in this review we discuss pre-clinical evidence suggesting ghrelin may be a useful therapeutic in protecting the brain against injury after ischemic stroke.  recent evidence suggests that ghrelin may also be neuroprotective after injury in animal models of cerebral ischemia.  we will also discuss its proposed mechanisms of action, including anti-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory effects, and suggest ghrelin treatment may be a useful intervention after stroke in the clinic.  collectively, these results demonstrate that post-stroke treatment with des-acylated ghrelin, but not acylated ghrelin, protects against ischaemia/reperfusion-induced brain injury and swelling, and bbb disruption, by reducing oxidative and/or nitrosative damage.  here, we investigated whether post-stroke treatment with acylated ghrelin or des-acylated ghrelin could improve functional and histological endpoints of stroke outcome in mice after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tmcao).  human ghrelin is thus a neuroprotective agent that inhibits inflammation, nnos activity, and apoptosis in focal cerebral ischemia through a vagal pathway.  specifically, we will discuss evidence showing ghrelin administration can improve neuronal cell survival in animal models of focal cerebral ischemia, as well as rescue memory deficits.  however, the effect of ghrelin in permanent focal cerebral ischemia and the role of the vagus nerve in its action remain unknown.  here, we aimed to determine whether endogenous ghrelin normally protects against neuronal cell death and cognitive impairments after global cerebral ischemia and whether such changes are linked with inflammation or apoptosis.  our data demonstrate that endogenous ghrelin plays a crucial role in protecting heart function and reducing mortality after myocardial infarction, and that these effects seem to be partly the result of sympathetic inhibition.  the hormone ghrelin prevents a dangerous increase in cardiac sympathetic nerve activity (sna) after acute myocardial infarction (mi), although the underlying mechanisms remain unknown.  thus exogenous ghrelin treatment can improve cell survival, reduce infarct size, and rescue memory deficits in focal ischemia models, doing so by suppressing inflammation and apoptosis.  accumulated research data have shown that acyl ghrelin exercises a significant neuroprotective effect against cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (i/r) injury in animal models and in cultured neurons during the acute phase, usually, 1 day after cerebral ischemia.  our study suggests that acyl ghrelin may be promising to restore the neuronal structure in the late phase after stroke.  our results suggested that in the cardiovascular system, ghrelin not only has an anti-inflammatory effect, but also has a significant immunoregulatory effect that may be mediated through the ghsr-1a receptor.  this study investigated the effect and potential mechanisms of ghrelin on hcy-induced endothelial dysfunction.  ghrelin, a novel growth hormone-releasing peptide, is implicated to play a protective role in cardiovascular tissues.  ghrelin, a brain-gut peptide, has been proven to exert neuroprotection in different kinds of neurological diseases; however, its role and the potential molecular mechanisms in secondary brain injury (sbi) after intracerebral hemorrhage (ich) are still unknown.  however, no study has examined whether endogenous ghrelin also contributes to neuroprotection after cerebral ischemia.  results showed that ghrelin attenuated neurobehavioral deficits, brain edema, hematoma volume, and perihematomal cell death post-ich. ||| ",yes
Does low T3 negatively affect prognosis of patients after cardiac surgery?,"those patients with low cardiac output syndrome after surgery had significantly lower t3 concentrations than patients without this complication.  clinical and experimental data have suggested a potential negative impact of low-t3 state on the prognosis of cardiac diseases.  a correlation between low t3 and poor clinical outcomes in the intensive care unit is more established.  to evaluate the prevalence and predictive value of low t3 levels on 30-day and 6-month mortality in non-critically ill patients.  low-t3 syndrome is a strong predictor of death in cardiac patients and might be directly implicated in the poor prognosis of cardiac patients.  low t3 levels are a prevalent condition among non-critically ill patients, and this condition is associated with poor clinical outcomes in this population.  the postoperative period after cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (cpb) is associated with a low t3 syndrome, i.e.  low-t(3) syndrome is a predictor of poor outcome in patients with cardiac dysfunction.  the effect of the baseline free t3 (ft3) concentration and of preoperative low t3 syndrome (ft3 <2.23 pmol/l) on the risk of low cardiac output (co) and death was analyzed in a logistic regression model.  low t3 levels were associated with higher 30-day hospital mortality (15.1% vs 4.1%, p < 0.001) and higher 6-month overall mortality (31.7% vs 13.2%, p < 0.001).  low t3 is related to increased early and late mortality in nste-acs patients.  we studied low t3 level's relation to long-term mortality in non-st-elevation acute coronary syndrome (nste-acs) patients.  in conclusion, low t3 predicts worse hospital outcomes in patients with acute hf and can be useful in the risk stratification of these patients.  the aim of this study is to investigate the prognostic value of total t3 levels for major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (macces) in patients with ami undergone percutaneous coronary intervention (pci).  low triiodothyronine (t3) state is associated with poor prognosis in critical acute and prolonged illness.  although a low triiodothyronine (t3) state is closely associated with heart failure (hf), it is uncertain whether total t3 levels on admission is correlated with the clinical outcomes of acute myocardial infarction (ami).  low total t3 correlated with an increased length of stay in the hospital (median 11 vs 7 days, p <0.001) and increased need for invasive mechanical ventilation (9.8% vs 1.3%, p = 0.045).  in multivariate analysis, low t3 was found to be related to mortality at 1 year (or: 2.6, 95% ci: 1.1-6.5, p = 0.02).  in addition, we examined low t3 level's relation to early and long-term mortality.  our preliminary data suggest that the low t3 state is a predictor of outcome in pulmonary patients with respiratory failure. ||| ",yes
Does mTOR regulate the translation of MAPKAPK2?,"the protein kinase mammalian target of rapamycin (mtor) regulates the phosphorylation and activity of several proteins that have the potential to control translation, including p70s6 kinase and the eif4e binding proteins 4e-bp1 and 4e-bp2.  these results suggest a novel regulatory mechanism for mtor gene expression that integrates the global protein synthesis changes induced by translational inhibitory conditions.  the mammalian target of rapamycin (mtor) is a ser/thr (s/t) protein kinase, which controls mrna translation initiation by modulating phosphorylation of the translational regulators phas-i and p70(s6k).  mammalian target of rapamycin (mtor) is a key kinase downstream of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (pi3k)/akt predominantly involved in translational control in the presence of nutrients and energy.  mammalian target of rapamycin (mtor) is a member of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-related kinase (pikk) family and is a major regulator of translation, cell growth, and autophagy.  these data suggest that under certain stress conditions: (i) translation has a greater requirement for mtor activity and (ii) there is an absolute requirement for the 4e-bps for regulation by mtor.  the kinase mtor (mammalian target of rapamycin) promotes translation as well as cell survival and proliferation under nutrient-rich conditions.  whereas mtor activates translation through ribosomal protein s6 kinase (s6k) and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4e-binding protein (4e-bp), how it facilitates cell proliferation has remained unclear.  moreover, our data reveal that the cap-independent translation of mtor is necessary for its ability to induce cell-cycle progression into s phase.  akt and rheb, a gtp-binding protein, regulate mtor protein kinase activity.  the levels of p-mtor are regulated by the protein kinase b (akt/pkb).  tti1 constitutively interacts with mtor in both mtorc1 and mtorc2.  mtor is a downstream mediator in the pi3k/akt signaling pathway and plays a critical role in cell survival.  mammalian target of rapamycin (mtor) is a serine-threonine kinase member of the cellular phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (pi3k) pathway, which is involved in multiple biologic functions such as transcriptional and translational control.  the mammalian target of rapamycin (mtor) has been shown to link growth factor signaling and posttranscriptional control of translation of proteins that are frequently involved in cell cycle progression.  mechanistic target of rapamycin (mtor) controls global translation of mrna into protein by phosphorylating p70 s6 kinase (s6k) and eif4e-binding protein-1.  the mammalian target of rapamycin (mtor), is a serine/threonine protein kinase and belongs to the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (pi3k)-related kinase (pikk) family.  the mammalian target of rapamycin (mtor) is a key element of the pi3kakt (protein kinase b) signalling pathway, responsible for the regulation of cell growth and proliferation.  the mammalian target of rapamycin (mtor), a member of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase related kinase (pikk) family, plays a central role in the regulation of cell growth.  mtorc2 mainly controls cell survival and migration through phosphorylating glucocorticoid-regulated kinase (sgk), protein kinase b (akt), and protein kinase c (pkc) kinase families. ||| ",yes
Does magnesium sulfate improve outcomes of subarachnoid hemorrhage patients?,"pilot clinical trials using magnesium sulfate in patients with acute aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage have reported trends toward improvement in clinical outcomes.  experimental work suggests a neuroprotective role for magnesium sulfate in aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage.  we studied 22 aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage patients with or without magnesium sulfate infusion for 10-14 days.  a meta-analysis of current data suggests that magnesium sulfate infusion improves the outcome after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage through a reduction in delayed ischemic neurological deficit.  randomized, parallel group, controlled trials of magnesium sulfate in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage were included.  to examine whether the maintenance of elevated magnesium serum concentrations by intravenous administration of magnesium sulfate can reduce the occurrence of cerebral ischemic events after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage.  a systematic review was conducted to determine the evidence for the prophylactic use of magnesium sulfate in aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage.  here we present data to assess the clinical effectiveness of magnesium sulfate in the prevention of cerebral vasospasm in patients who have suffered from aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage.  these data support the hypothesis that magnesium influences hemorrhage severity in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage, potentially through a hemostatic mechanism.  preliminary evidence has suggested that magnesium sulfate infusion reduces delayed ischemic neurological deficit and improves clinical outcome after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage.  current evidence does not support the prophylactic use of magnesium sulfate in aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage.  we aim to investigate the cerebral hemodynamic effects of magnesium sulfate infusion in aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage patients.  magnesium sulfate (mgso4) may be useful in preventing neurological injury after subarachnoid haemorrhage (sah).  these data indicate that high-dose intravenous magnesium can reduce cerebral ischemic events after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage by attenuating vasospasm and increasing the ischemic tolerance during critical hypoperfusion.  we tested the hypothesis that admission serum magnesium levels are associated with extent of hemorrhage in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage.  despite the publication of several randomized controlled studies, there is still much debate on whether magnesium sulfate improves outcome in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage.  a total of 12 patients who had experienced aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage were randomized to magnesium sulfate infusion (n = 6) or placebo infusion (n = 6) for 14 days.  we did a trial to test whether magnesium therapy improves outcome after aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage.  intravenous magnesium sulphate does not improve clinical outcome after aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage, therefore routine administration of magnesium cannot be recommended.  a meta-analysis was conducted to assess the effectiveness and safety of intravenous magnesium therapy in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage (sah). ||| ",no
Does melanoma  occur in people of African origin ?,"our study shows that malignant melanoma occurs in black people in malawi and may be an under-appreciated malignancy.  factors that contribute to melanoma in blacks and rates of occurrence are reviewed and discussed.  observed difference in cutaneous melanoma between people of african descent and caucasians include; a higher incidence and better prognosis in caucasians, a low awareness of melanoma, no definite risk factors, presentation with advanced disease, poor melanoma specific survival in people of african descent.  malignant melanoma is common among the whites of south africa.  this study is concerned with the epidemiology of malignant melanoma, as seen in both urban and rural black africans.  malignant melanoma of the skin in blacks in formidable and sinister tumour.  primary acquired melanosis may lead to the development of melanoma even in blacks.  this review article explores critical features of melanoma in african-americans that distinguish it from disease seen in caucasians, including the clinical presentation, histological patterns, prognostic indicators, and etiology.  earlier studies have shown frequent mutations in the braf and nras genes in cutaneous melanoma, but these alterations have not been examined in the rare category of melanoma from black africans.  although rare, malignant melanoma (mm) is a real and serious risk for african americans.  african americans have a proportionately higher incidence of acral melanoma, both the acral lentiginous melanoma (alm) histologic subtype and subungual melanoma (sm).  results of this study indicate a high incidence rate of melanoma in white south africans, comparable with that in australia, which demands urgent preventive health measures.  although relatively uncommon, malignant melanoma in african-americans and other minority ethnic populations represents an aggressive disease highly associated with invasive lesions and a more advanced stage of disease at diagnosis, and consequently with a decreased survival compared with caucasians.  cutaneous melanoma features in tunisia are closer to those of non-caucasians, even though gender differences that are similar to those observed in caucasians were uncovered.  scant data exists on melanoma in blacks from africa.  the aim of this study was to determine the epidemiological profile, anatomical distribution and histopathological features of melanoma presenting in africans at a tertiary referral hospital in malawi.  there is a world-wide increase in the incidence of cutaneous malignant melanoma among white people.  this study brings to light the anomalous situation that among the eur-african-malay population (those of mixed ancestry), malignant melanoma has probably the lowest incidence in the world.  moreover, melanomas from black africans exhibited mutations in nras exon 1 only (12%), whereas nras exon 2 mutations were predominant in melanomas from caucasians.  epidemiological features and trends of cutaneous melanoma (cm) in north-african populations remain unclear. ||| ",yes
Does metformin interfere thyroxine absorption?,"this study examined the effect of metformin ingestion on lt4 absorption, as assessed by serum total thyroxine (tt4) concentrations.  it has been hypothesized that metformin may suppress serum thyrotropin (tsh) concentrations by enhancing lt4 absorption or by directly affecting the hypothalamic-pituitary axis.  in both study groups, metformin treatment exerted a neutral effect on free and total thyroxine and triiodothyronine.  the impact of metformin on thyrotropin levels is sex-dependent.  metformin was found to reduce elevated thyrotropin levels in subjects with hypothyroidism.  chronic metformin treatment was found to reduce elevated thyrotropin levels.  metformin was found to reduce thyrotrophin levels in subjects with hypothyroidism.  the obtained results indicate that the effect of metformin on hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis activity is partially related to thyroid function.  objective to prospectively evaluate if administration of metformin to obese, diabetic patients with primary hypothyroidism on stable thyroxine replacement doses modifies tsh levels.  a thyrotropin(tsh)-lowering effect of metformin therapy has been recently reported in patients with type 2 diabetes (t2d) and hypothyroidism.  this study aims to study the effect of metformin on thyroid-stimulating hormone (tsh) in hypothyroid and euthyroid individuals, as both these diseases have an increased prevalence and coexistence.  metformin administration influences tsh without change of ft4 in patients with type 2 diabetes and concomitant hypothyroidism.  on the other hand, there is also data supporting that metformin administration inhibits iodine uptake by thyroid cells and thus may limit the effectiveness of radioactive iodine treatment.  to review literature data on the role of metformin use on thyroid function tests and the course of thyroid cancer.  the results obtained suggest that the impact of metformin on hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis activity depends on the oestrogen status of patients.  the objective of this analysis is to evaluate the effect of metformin treatment on serum tsh, free triiodothyronine (ft3), and free thyroxine (ft4) levels and other associated physiological indices.  apart from reducing plasma glucose, homa1-ir and glycated hemoglobin, metformin decreased serum levels of thyrotropin.  metformin induces a reduction in tsh levels both in overt and in subclinical hypothyroidism.  in this longitudinal population-based study, metformin use was associated with an increased incidence of low tsh levels in patients with treated hypothyroidism, but not in euthyroid patients.  in hypothyroid patients, metformin was found to reduce serum levels of tsh. ||| ",no
Does molindone affect body weight?,"our results challenge the common opinion that molindone can be associated with a lack of weight gain compared to other antipsychotics.  a retrospective review was conducted to assess the effect of molindone on weight.  the weight-reducing property of molindone, a recently introduced antipsychotic drug, was tested in 9 hospitalized chronic schizophrenic patients.  the obvious side effect of this drug is weight gain.  mirtazapine, a widely used antidepressant, induces adverse metabolic effects such as an increase in body weight.  moxonidine decreased food intake throughout by 20% in obese rats (p<0.001) and by 8% in lean rats (p<0.001), and reduced weight gain that final body weight was 15% lower in obese (p<0.001) and 7% lower in lean (p<0.01) rats than their untreated controls.  there are limited data concerning its effect on weight or body mass index (bmi).  the antidepressant therapy with mirtazapine was associated with a significant increase in body weight, body fat mass, and leptin concentration.  fluoxetine is an anorexic agent known to reduce food intake and weight gain.  monthly weights and neuroleptic dosages during the first three months of psychiatric hospitalization were compared between matched groups of patients receiving molindone, a combination of molindone and other neuroleptics, or other neuroleptic drugs.  weight gain is a common side effect of psychotropic medications.  fluoxetine persistently suppressed food intake and weight gain during the experimental period.  there was an average weight loss of 7.6 kg after 3 months on molindone; most of the loss occurred during the first month.  in adult rats, naloxonazine and naloxone significantly reduced body weight (7% and 4%, respectively) and food intake (21% and 13%, respectively) over 14 days.  the mean +/- sd body weight increased from 63.6 +/- 13.1 kg to 66.6 +/- 11.9 kg during mirtazapine treatment (p = .027).  these effects in adipogenesis by pimozide may help to explain the weight gain that is frequently observed in patients treated with pimozide.  the antihypertensive agent moxonidine, an imidazoline ii-receptor agonist, also induces hypophagia and lowers body weight in the obese spontaneously hypertensive rat, but the central mediation of this action and the neuronal pathways that moxonidine may interact with are not known.  the aim of this study was to investigate the influence of mirtazapine treatment on body weight, body fat mass, glucose metabolism, lipoprotein profile, and leptin and its soluble receptor in a prospective, controlled study design.  melperone did not result in significant increases in bmi.  these effects were more pronounced in adolescent rats where naloxonazine and naloxone significantly reduced the gain in body-weight (53% and 33%, respectively) and food intake (24% and 15%, respectively) over 14 days. ||| ",yes
Does neuroglobin has neuroprotective properties in the setting of traumatic brain injury?,"neuroglobin has shown rich neuroprotective effects against cerebral hypoxia, and therefore has the potential to impact outcomes after traumatic brain injury (tbi).  the results of this study, showing a lack of effect in mild traumatic brain injury as well as asynchronous time course changes in neuroglobin expression, oxidative/nitrosative stress, and antioxidants in severe traumatic brain injury, do not seem to support the role of neuroglobin as an endogenous neuroprotective antioxidant agent, at least under pathophysiological conditions.  to date, neuroglobin levels have been positively correlated with a beneficial outcome in a plethora of neurotoxic insults, e.g., ischemic and traumatic brain injuries and alzheimer's disease.  in this study, we evaluated the pathophysiological response of the neuroglobin gene and protein expression in the cerebral tissue of rats sustaining traumatic brain injury of differing severity, while simultaneously measuring the oxidant/antioxidant balance.  neuroglobin (ngb) is an oxygen-binding protein that is mainly expressed in nervous tissues where it is considered to be neuroprotective during ischemic brain injury.  various studies seem to indicate that neuroglobin is a neuroprotective agent when overexpressed, acting as a potent inhibitor of oxidative and nitrosative stress.  results indicated that mild traumatic brain injury, although causing a reversible increase in oxidative/nitrosative stress (increase in malondialdehyde and nitrite + nitrate) and an imbalance in antioxidants (decrease in ascorbate and gsh), did not induce any change in neuroglobin.  conversely, severe traumatic brain injury caused an over nine- and a fivefold increase in neuroglobin gene and protein expression, respectively, as well as a remarkable increase in oxidative/nitrosative stress and depletion of antioxidants.  augmenting o2 supply, neuroglobin promotes survival of neurons upon hypoxic injury, potentially limiting brain damage.  neuroglobin was detected in several brain areas, and its expression was increased in the cortical peri-infarct region after stroke.  neuroglobin (ngb), a neuron-specific globin that binds oxygen in vitro, has been proposed to play a key role in neuronal survival following hypoxic and ischemic insults in the brain.  in the second part, we shed light on the mechanisms by which neuroglobin contributes to neuroprotection, being (i) the scavenging and detoxification of reactive oxygen/nitrogen species, (ii) the augmentation of the threshold for apoptosis initiation, (iii) its contribution to an anti-inflammatory milieu, and (iv) tissue regeneration.  we investigated whether neuroglobin, a neuronal protein that protects neurons from hypoxic-ischemic injury, is upregulated in ischemic stroke.  rats were then sacrificed at 6, 12, 24, 48, and 120 h after traumatic brain injury, and the gene and protein expression of neuroglobin and the concentrations of malondialdehyde (as a parameter representative of reactive oxygen species-mediated damage), nitrite + nitrate (indicative of no metabolism), ascorbate, and glutathione (gsh) were determined in the brain tissue.  neuroglobin is considered to be a novel important pharmacological target in combating stroke and neurodegenerative disorders, although the mechanism by which this protection is accomplished remains an enigma.  ischemic stroke increases expression of the neuroprotective protein neuroglobin, suggesting neuroglobin may represent a novel target for stroke therapy.  although cytoprotective effects of neuroglobin on neuronal damage have been reported, the physiological mechanisms of neuroglobin function remain unknown.  neuroglobin (ngb), one of novel members of the globin superfamily, is expressed predominantly in brain neurons, and appears to modulate hypoxic-ischemic insults.  since its discovery, neuroglobin (ngb), a neuron-specific oxygen binding hemoglobin, distinct from the classical myoglobin and blood hemoglobin, has attracted attention as an endogenous neuroprotectant.  neuroglobin is a hypoxia-inducible o(2)-binding protein with neuroprotective effects in cell and animal models of stroke and alzheimer's disease. ||| ",yes
Does nifedipine inhibit L-type calcium channels?,"the dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker nifedipine induces specific pharmacological effects by binding to l-type calcium channels, which results in a reduced calcium influx in vascular smooth muscle cells (vsmcs) and is currently employed in antihypertensive drug.  owing to its high receptor affinity, nilvadipine blocks l-type calcium channels in vascular muscle cells.  there is evidence that nifedipine (nif) - a dihydropyridine (dhp) ca(2+)-channel antagonist mostly known for its l-type-specific action--is capable of blocking low voltage-activated (lva or t-type) ca(2+) channels as well.  nifedipine (0.1 and 1 microm), a dihydropyridine ca2+ channel blocker, did not relax bovine ciliary muscle precontracted with 100 mm kcl.  nimodipine is a clinically used dihydropyridine l-type calcium channel antagonist that effectively inhibits transmembrane ca2+ influx following the depolarization of smooth muscle cells, but the detailed effect on smooth muscle contraction is not fully understood.  this indicates that oral nicardipine occupied approximately 15-20% of l-type ca2+ channels.  nifedipine, a classic l-type dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker (ccb), has been reported to possess multiple cardioprotective properties.  this suggests that an oral dose of nicardipine (sustained-release formulation) in duces a significant occupancy of l-type ca2+ channels in rat frontal cortex and hippocampus for about one day.  these findings indicate that oral treatment with 3 mg/kg of nicardipine (sustained-release formulation) occupies l-type ca2+ channels in rat brain by more than 40% from the 6th to the 24th h after drug administration.  it is unknown whether the widely used l-type ca(2+) channel antagonists diltiazem and nifedipine would block the repolarization k(+) currents, transient outward current (i(to1)) and ultra-rapid delayed rectifier k(+) current (i(kur)), in human atrium.  the occupancy of l-type ca2+ channels by treatment with an oral dose of the dihydropyridine-type ca2+ antagonist nicardipine (sustained-release formulation) was evaluated in membrane preparations of rat frontal cortex and hippocampus using a radioligand binding assay technique, with -nicardipine as a ligand.  unlike classical pharmacological ca2+ channel blockers, cilnidipine's block of ca2+ currents did not reach steady-state levels within 10 min, indicating steady-state half-maximal inhibition of native, multi-subunit l-type channels at < 10 nmol/l.  to address this issue, we studied the effects of cilnidipine on multi-subunit, c-class l-type ca2+ channels in rat aortic a7r5 cells, as well as on ca2+ channel (l-type) alpha1c-b and (t-type) alpha1g subunits in the xenopus oocyte expression system.  these findings provide new insights into the mechanism of action of flunarizine on voltage-dependent ca2+ channels.  we investigated the effect of cilnidipine, a novel dihydropyridine ca2+ channel blocker possessing blocking actions on n-type and l-type voltage-dependent ca2+ channels (vdccs), in comparison with the l-type vdcc blocker nifedipine, on adrenal catecholamine secretion in response to splanchnic nerve stimulation (sns), acetylcholine (ach), the nicotinic receptor stimulant 1,1-dimethyl-4-phenyl-piperazinium (dmpp), and muscarine in anesthetized dogs.  cilnidipine, a dihydropyridine ca(2+) channel antagonist, is known to have inhibitory effects on both l- and n-type ca(2+) currents.  moderate inhibition of the l-type calcium channels by haloperidol might cause shortening of action potential.  we conclude that ca(v)3.2 is the most sensitive to nif, and that quantitative characteristics of drug action on t-type ca(2+) channels depend on cellular system they are expressed in.  a progressive occupancy of ca2+ channels was observed between six and 12 h after nicardipine administration.  flunarizine is a substance known to block voltage-dependent ca2+ channels in smooth muscle and neuronal cells. ||| ",yes
Does nimotuzumab improve survival of glioblastoma patients?,"this article integrates published research findings regarding the role of nimotuzumab in the treatment of high grade glioma in combination with radiotherapy or radiochemotherapy in adult and pediatric populations.  to evaluate the safety and efficacy of nimotuzumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody specific for the epidermal growth factor receptor (egfr), in combination with temozolomide (tmz) and radiation therapy (rt) in the treatment of newly diagnosed glioblastoma (gbm) in chinese patients.  149 glioblastoma patients stratified as with or without residual tumour were randomly assigned to receive either intravenous nimotuzumab 400mg weekly added to standard radiochemotherapy followed by 400mg biweekly after twelve weeks or standard radiochemotherapy.  bevacizumab has been shown to improve progression-free survival and neurologic function, but failed to improve overall survival in newly diagnosed glioblastoma and at first recurrence.  a randomised, open label phase iii trial was conducted to evaluate efficacy of nimotuzumab, a monoclonal antibody against epidermal growth factor receptor (egf-r) added to standard therapy for newly diagnosed glioblastoma.  introduction: despite surgical and chemotherapeutical treatment options, the prognosis for glioblastoma (gbm) remains poor.  to investigate the question of whether salvage therapy with the programmed cell death protein 1 (pd-1)-blocking antibodies nivolumab or pembrolizumab with or without bevacizumab offers clinical or survival benefit in patients with recurrent high-grade gliomas (hggs).  recently completed trials suggest the addition of nitrosourea-based chemotherapy to radiotherapy increases the progression-free but not overall survival of grade ii and iii gliomas.  this study, albeit negative, contains hypothesis generating signals supporting evaluation of correlative, efficacy-predicting tumour parameters for nimotuzumab in the treatment of glioblastoma.  it is hoped that this review may provide further insight into the rational design of new approaches employing nimotuzumab as a useful alternative for the therapeutic management of high grade glioma.  in patients with glioblastoma, antiangiogenic therapy with bevacizumab (bev) has been shown to improve progression-free survival (pfs), but not overall survival (os).  despite treatment with the current standard-of-care therapies, patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme (gbm) exhibit dismal prognoses.  bevacizumab is one of the rare drugs that could improve high-grade glioma outcome after failure of chemoradiotherapy.  we performed a retrospective analysis of clinical factors associated with patient survival using a training cohort of 110 consecutive patients treated with bevacizumab for recurrent high-grade glioma and an independent validation cohort of 109 patients.  glioblastoma multiforme (gbm) has a dismal prognosis even with the best available treatment.  temozolomide has proven benefit in grade ii/iii gliomas progressive following standard therapy and when added to radiation for glioblastoma.  patients with the most common and lethal intracranial neoplasia, glioblastoma multiforme (gbm), have an average survival of one year with combination of surgical resection, radiotherapy and temozolomide.  this was a single-institution retrospective observational study in 31 adult patients who received pembrolizumab (keytruda) or nivolumab (opdivo) with or without concurrent bevacizumab for recurrent high-grade glioma.  based on these results, anti-angiogenic therapy with bevacizumab should also be considered in patients suffering from gliomas with a mainly infiltrative phenotype.  since its approval for use in recurrent glioblastoma (gbm), the survival benefit of bevacizumab (bev) remains to be demonstrated. ||| ",yes
Does oculocutaneous albinism show an autosomal recessive inheritance?,"oculocutaneous albinism is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder.  oculocutaneous albinism (oca) is an autosomal recessive disorder.  oculocutaneous albinism (oca) is an autosomal recessive disorder.  analysis using the pointer program showed that this type of oculocutaneous albinism was inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, with an estimated gene frequency of 0.025 +/- 0.007 in this population.  albinism is inherited as autosomal recessive, with one exception: ocular albinism, which has an x-linked trait.  autosomal recessive oculocutaneous albinism (oca) is phenotypically and genetically heterogenous (associated with seven genes).  oculocutaneous albinism is a group of autosomal recessive disorders featuring hypopigmentation of the hair, skin and eyes.  several types of oculocutaneous albinism are caused by mutation in related genes.  this study expands the mutation spectrum of oculocutaneous albinism.  oculocutaneous albinism (oca) is a heterogeneous group of autosomal recessive disorders resulting from mutations of the tyrosinase (tyr) gene and presents with either complete or partial absence of pigment in the skin, hair and eyes due to a defect in an enzyme involved in the production of melanin.  oculocutaneous albinism (oca) is a set of autosomal recessive disorders characterized by hypopigmented hair, skin and eyes.  oculocutaneous albinism (oca), which is roughly divided into non-syndromic and syndromic oca, is a group of autosomal recessive disorders caused by mutations in genes associated with pigmentation.  oculocutaneous albinism (oca) is an autosomal recessive pigmentation abnormality, characterized by variable hair, skin, and ocular hypopigmentation.  oculocutaneous albinism 1 is associated with the tyrosinase gene.  non-syndromic oculocutaneous albinism (oca) is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous autosomal recessive disorder with mutations identified in several genes: oca1 (tyrosinase, tyr), oca2 (oca2), oca3 (tyrosinase-related protein 1, tyrp1), and oca4 (membrane-associated transporter protein, matp).  oculocutaneous albinism (oca) in man may be caused by mutations within the tyrosinase gene (tyr) resulting in oca1.  the purpose of this study was to evaluate the molecular basis of oculocutaneous albinism in four chinese families.  the segregation of brown (type iv) oculocutaneous albinism was analyzed in 18 nigerian families.  tyrosinase-positive oculocutaneous albinism (ty-pos oca), an autosomal recessive disorder of the melanin biosynthetic pathway, is the most common type of albinism occurring worldwide.  oculocutaneous albinism (oca) is the most frequent presentation of albinism, a heterogeneous rare genetic condition generally associated with variable alterations in pigmentation and with a profound visual impairment. ||| ",yes
Does oncogene-induced DNA replication stress inhibit genomic instability?,"here, we review our current understanding of replication initiation and its regulation, describe mechanisms by which activated oncogenes might interfere with these processes and discuss how replicative stress might contribute to the genomic instability seen in cancers.  oncogene-induced replication stress, for instance as a result of cyclin e1 overexpression, causes genomic instability and has been linked to tumorigenesis.  oncogene-induced dna replication stress activates the dna damage response (ddr), a crucial anticancer barrier.  dna replication stress promotes genome instability in cancer.  here, we identify that oncogene expression, similar to other replication stress-inducing agents, induces single-stranded dna (ssdna) gaps that reduce cell fitness.  activated oncogenes promote replicative stress, inducing a dna damage response (ddr) early in tumorigenesis.  one mechanism by which oncogene expression induces replication stress is to drive cell proliferation with insufficient nucleotide levels.  the mechanisms by which neoplastic cells tolerate oncogene-induced dna replication stress are poorly understood.  we modeled oncogene-induced replication stress using inducible expression of cyclin e1 or cdc25a in non-transformed rpe-1 cells, either in a tp53 wild-type or tp53-mutant background.  chromosomal instability in early cancer stages is caused by replication stress.  chromosomal instability in early cancer stages is caused by stress on dna replication.  despite its potential importance in early cancer development, the precise nature of oncogene-induced replicative stress remains poorly understood.  we propose that nucleolytic processing of unusual replication intermediates mediates oncogene-induced genotoxicity and that limiting such processing to mitosis is a central anti-tumorigenic function of the dna damage checkpoints.  the replication stress response, which serves as an anticancer barrier, is activated not only by dna damage and replication obstacles but also oncogenes, thus obscuring how cancer evolves.  exogenously supplied nucleosides rescued the replication stress and dna damage and dramatically decreased oncogene-induced transformation.  here, we investigated whether replication stress can be modulated by both genetic and non-genetic factors and whether the extent of replication stress affects the probability of neoplastic transformation.  oncogene-induced dna damage elicits genomic instability in epithelial cancer cells, but apoptosis is blocked through inactivation of the tumor suppressor p53.  folate deficiency significantly enhances oncogene-induced replication stress, leading to increased dna damage and tumorigenicity in vitro.  single cell sequencing revealed that replication stress and mitotic defects upon cyclin e1 or cdc25a overexpression resulted in genomic instability.  replication stress, a major cause of genome instability in cycling cells, is mainly prevented by the atr-dependent replication stress response pathway in somatic cells. ||| ",no
Does physical activity influence gut hormones?,"we examined whether changes in gut hormone levels due to a single bout of aerobic exercise differ between obese young males and normal controls, and attempted to determine the involvement of hormonal changes during exercise in the regulation of energy balance (eb) in these obese subjects.  our data suggest that the control of spontaneous physical activity by gut hormones or their neuropeptide targets may represent an important mechanistic component of energy balance regulation.  there is growing interest in the effects of exercise on plasma gut hormone levels and subsequent energy intake (ei) but the effects of mode and exercise intensity on anorectic hormone profiles on subsequent ei remain to be elucidated.  this narrative review explores the effects of exercise and training on the concentrations of gastrointestinal hormones in healthy and obese individuals.  evidence suggests that physical activity (pa) influences the human gut microbiota composition, but its role is unclear because of dietary interference.  the present findings raise the possibility that each gut hormone exhibits its specific blood kinetics in response to two different intensities of exercise stimuli and might play differential roles in regulation of ei after exercise.  in conclusion, physical activity (regardless of specific characteristics) has significant contribution to gut microbiome composition and associated metabolites.  growing evidence shows the contribution of physical activity interventions to the gut microbiome.  structured exercise induced subtle changes to the human gut microbiota.  studies suggest that exercise affects the composition and function of the human gut microbiota, yet this has not been investigated in a randomized controlled trial.  the effect of regular physical activity (pa) on food intake, gastric emptying (ge), gastric accommodation, and gastrointestinal (gi) hormones in adults with obesity remains unclear.  exercise and gut symptomatology have long been connected.  exercise may affect gallbladder motility via neural or hormonal mechanisms.  in conclusion, regular physical exercise may alter the morphology or/and functions of the small intestine, reducing the prejudicial effects of hypothalamic obesity.  the objective of this review was to determine the magnitude of exercise effects on levels of gastrointestinal hormones related to appetite, using systematic review and meta-analysis.  this review's aim was to explore the contribution of physical activity intervention characteristics on human gut microbiome composition, in terms of diversity, specific bacterial groups, and associated gut microbiome metabolites.  the primary aim of this study was to assess if exercise alters the diversity, composition and functional potential of the gut microbiota in free-living humans.  our results illustrate that exercise has a moderate but measurable effect on gut microbial communities in mice.  while both exercise and the gut microbiome have been shown to impact human health independently, the direct effects of moderate exercise on the intestinal microbiota remain unclear.  exercise-induced changes in appetite-regulating hormones may be intensity-dependent, however a clear dose-response relationship has not been established. ||| ",yes
Does prolactinoma increase osteoporosis risk?,"humans with prolactinoma are at risk for osteoporosis.  raised prolactin levels have been linked with osteoporosis.  there is evidence that prolactin (prl) excess plays a role in the etiology of osteoporosis associated with human prolactinoma.  patients with prolactinoma seem to be at high risk for osteopenia.  osteopenia and osteoporosis because of hyperprolactinaemia caused by prolactinoma may be followed by an increased risk of fracture.  in the premenopausal women, patients with prolactinoma or craniopharyngioma are often accompanied with osteopenia or osteoporosis, and disease duration and hypogonadism are the risk factors of bone loss in prolactinoma.  univariate and multivariate regression analysis indicated that the bone loss in prolactinomas was significantly correlated to disease duration and hypogonadism.  prolactin elevation has been proposed as a risk factor for low bone density and potentially osteoporosis in patients on long-term treatment with prolactin-elevating antipsychotics.  hyperprolactinaemia caused by prolactinoma in women influences bone metabolism unfavourably, more by the impact on the activity of bone turnover markers than on bmd.  levels of prolactin, markers of bone metabolism, and risk factors for osteoporosis were measured.  hyperprolactinaemia may be associated with hidden longer-term consequences, such as osteoporosis, bone fractures, pituitary tumours and breast cancer.  an increased prevalence of radiological vertebral fractures was recently observed in women with prolactin (prl)-secreting adenoma, whereas it is unknown whether this observation may reflect a more general increased risk of fractures in this disease and whether the prevalence of fractures in males is affected by gonadal status.  this may have important implications for prolactin monitoring or the periodic assessment of osteoporosis-related outcomes in patients requiring extended treatment.  although its osteopenic effect has long been explained as hyperprolactinemia-induced hypogonadism, identified prolactin (prl) receptors in osteoblasts suggested a possible direct action of prl on bone.  prolactin (prl) has been reported to be associated with increased bone turnover, and increased bone turnover is also a feature of skeletal fluorosis (sf).  therefore, the present data indicate that the osteoporosis of hyperprolactinemia is likely due to prl-induced hypogonadism, rather than a direct effect of prl on calcium homeostatis.  antipsychotic agents can increase circulating serum prolactin levels, potentially leading to osteoporosis and increased risk of bone fracture.  the presence of decreased bone mineral content in hyperprolactinemic patients suggests that prl may have a direct effect on bone and may be another indication for early treatment of prl-secreting pituitary tumors.  however, the presence of prolactin receptor in human osteosarcoma cell line and primary bone cell culture from mouse calvariae supported the hypothesis of a direct prolactin (prl) action on bone cells.  hyperprolactinemia is associated with high prevalence of radiological vertebral fractures in men with prl-secreting adenoma. ||| ",yes
Does prudent diet reduce cardiovascular risk?,"prudent dietary patterns are associated with reduced risk of arterial cardiovascular diseases (cvd).  this paper describes the importance of diet in cardiovascular disease prevention.  epidemiological findings indicate that higher adherence to a healthy diet may lower cardiovascular disease (cvd) risk.  consumption of healthy dietary patterns has been associated with reduced risk of cardiovascular disease and metabolic syndrome.  consuming a heart-healthy diet lowers the individual's risk for cardiovascular disease.  healthy lifestyle choices such as eating a prudent diet, exercising regularly, managing weight, and not smoking may substantially reduce coronary heart disease (chd) risk by improving lipids, blood pressure, and other risk factors.  a successful dietary strategy should reduce coronary heart disease (chd) endpoints, improve correctable risk factors for chd, and provide for an overall healthful lifestyle.  persons following current dietary guidelines have a lower risk of mortality from coronary heart disease.  we conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: what are the effects of dietary advice in generally healthy adults without existing cvd or increased cvd risk factors to improve cardiovascular outcomes (mortality, cardiovascular events, and cardiovascular risk factors)?  we conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: what are the effects of dietary advice in generally healthy adults without existing cvd or increased cvd risk factors to improve cardiovascular outcomes (mortality, cardiovascular events, and cardiovascular risk factors)?  individual change in dietary behaviour has the potential to decrease the burden of chronic disease, particularly cardiovascular disease (cvd).  individual change in dietary behaviour has the potential to decrease the burden of chronic disease, particularly cardiovascular disease (cvd).  the evidence regarding the impact of diet on intermediate risk factors (such as blood pressure and cholesterol levels) and the impact on cardiovascular endpoints are discussed.  evidence that lowering blood cholesterol levels reduces risk of coronary heart disease has prompted widespread recommendations that hyperlipidemic individuals undergo dietary therapy.  compared with participants whose diet quality remained relatively stable in each 4-year period, those with the greatest improvement in diet quality scores had a 7% to 8% lower cvd risk in the subsequent 4-year period (pooled hazard ratio, 0.92  for the alternative healthy eating index; 0.93  for the alternative mediterranean diet score; and 0.93  for the dietary approach to stop hypertension; all p for trend <0.05).  modifiable risk factors, such as diet, are becomingly increasingly important in the management of cardiovascular disease, one of the greatest major causes of death and disease burden.  our findings suggest that a heart healthy dietary pattern is associated with moderately reduced risk of mi, but not related to risk of vte.  adherence to a healthy diet was examined in relation to cvd, coronary heart disease (chd), and stroke incidence (cox regression), and risk markers (linear regression) with adjustment for relevant confounders.  adherence to several diet quality scores, including the alternative healthy eating index, alternative mediterranean diet score, and dietary approach to stop hypertension, has been associated with lower risk of cardiovascular disease (cvd), but little is known about how changes in these scores over time influence subsequent cvd risk.  we analyzed the association between 4-year changes in the 3 diet quality scores (alternative healthy eating index, alternative mediterranean diet score, and dietary approach to stop hypertension) and subsequent cardiovascular disease (cvd) risk among 29 343 men in the health professionals follow-up study and 51 195 women in the nurses' health study (1986-2010). ||| ",yes
Does replication timing affect the rate of somatic mutations?,"recent studies revealed a long suspected replication-timing effect on mutation rate, but the mechanisms that regulate the increase in mutation rate as the genome is replicated remain unclear.  replication timing can affect genomic integrity because late replication is associated with an increased mutation rate.  replication timing is an important determinant of germline mutation patterns, with a higher rate of point mutations in late replicating regions.  a recent flurry of reports correlates replication timing (rt) with mutation rates during both evolution and cancer.  the dna replication timing program is modulated throughout development and is also one of the main factors influencing the distribution of mutation rates across the genome.  genome-wide association of replication timing with genetic variation identified 16 loci at which inherited alleles associate with replication timing.  we observe that most of the detected mutational signatures are significantly correlated with the timing or direction of dna replication.  replication timing is a crucial aspect of genome regulation that is strongly correlated with chromatin structure, gene expression, dna repair, and genome evolution.  specifically, point mutations and copy number losses correlate with late replication, while copy number gains and other rearrangements correlate with early replication.  asynchronous replication of the genome has been associated with different rates of point mutation and copy number variation (cnv) in human populations.  our results show replication timing to be shaped by genetic polymorphism and identify a means by which inherited polymorphism regulates the mutability of nearby sequences.  the realization that replication timing correlates with important features, such as transcription, chromatin structure and genome evolution, and is misregulated in cancer and aging has only deepened the fascination.  at the same time, mutation rates in both vertebrates and invertebrates have been shown to vary with generation time (gt).  genomic dna replicates in a choreographed temporal order that impacts the distribution of mutations along the genome.  we traced the relationship between replication timing and the evolutionary age of duplicated genes.  these results establish a framework in which further mechanistic studies on replication timing, such as the strong effect of heterochromatin, can be pursued.  early replication timing has been positively correlated with several histone modifications that occur at active genes, while repressive histone modifications mark late replicating regions.  we show here that dna replication timing is shaped by genetic polymorphisms that act in cis upon megabase-scale dna segments.  point mutation rates may reflect temporal variation in repair mechanisms.  the replication timing of different dna sequences in the mammalian cell nucleus is a tightly regulated system, which affects important cellular processes such as genes expression, chromatin epigenetic marking, and maintenance of chromosome structure. ||| ",yes
Does resveratrol reduce cardiac remodeling?,"objective: accumulating evidence suggested that resveratrol (res) could protect against adverse cardiac remodeling induced by several cardiovascular diseases.  therefore, we evaluated the effect of resveratrol treatment on the progression of cardiac remodeling after mi.  resveratrol attenuated other features of cardiovascular remodelling such as increases in systolic blood pressure, left ventricular wet weight, left ventricular wall thickness, diastolic stiffness constant, as well as decreased cardiac contractility and prolonged action potential duration characteristic of doca-salt rats.  we propose that the anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects of resveratrol are responsible, at least in part, for its amelioration in cardiovascular remodelling in doca-salt rats.  resveratrol reportedly promotes the improvement of cardiac dysfunction and other cardiovascular diseases.  resveratrol treatment significantly improved cardiac function and alleviated cardiac hypertrophy, oxidative stress, and apoptosis in cih rats.  the present study was performed to investigate whether the resveratrol alleviated cardiac hypertrophy and functional remodelling by regulating autophagy.  resveratrol treatment does not improve cardiac remodeling and global hemodynamic function post-mi but does preserve contractile reserve and attenuate anf and ctgf up-regulation.  we propose that the antioxidant and antiapoptotic effects of resveratrol, together with its previously described anti-inflammatory actions, are responsible, at least in part, for its cardioprotective effects.  resveratrol treatment of mice with established hf lessens the severity of the hf phenotype by lessening cardiac fibrosis, improving molecular and structural remodeling of the heart, and enhancing diastolic function, vascular function, and energy metabolism.  in these doca-salt rats, resveratrol decreased inflammatory cell infiltration, decreased cardiac fibrosis (left ventricular interstitial and perivascular collagen content) and improved cardiac and vascular function.  this study has determined whether treatment with resveratrol (1 mg/kg/day orally) prevented cardiac fibrosis and the decreased cardiovascular function in the doca-salt hypertensive rat as a model of human hypertension.  in conclusion, our study shows that resveratrol can reduce ros in cardiomyocytes by pi3k/akt signaling pathway activation, and effectively inhibit the apoptosis of cardiomyocytes, thus having a direct protective effect on cardiomyocytes under sr.  here we aim to investigate whether resveratrol can reduce the degree of myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (ir) injury and inhibit the development of oxidative stress, and elucidate the molecular mechanism of resveratrol in protecting myocardial cells.  resveratrol (trans-3,5,4'-trihydroxystilbene) (rsv) is a natural polyphenol with protective effects over cardiac tissues and can affect cell survival and differentiation in cardiac stem cells transplantation.  trans-resveratrol (resveratrol) has been shown to have beneficial effects on the cardiovascular system in a number of studies.  despite a lack of improvement in ejection fraction, resveratrol treatment significantly increased median survival of mice with hf, lessened cardiac fibrosis, reduced gene expression of several disease markers for hypertrophy and extracellular matrix remodeling that were upregulated in hf, promoted beneficial remodeling, and improved diastolic function.  in summary, resveratrol, at a nutritionally relevant dose, prevents or attenuates the adverse changes in the cardiovascular system.  these results indicated that resveratrol depressed cardiac muscle contraction and shortened action potential duration probably due to the activation of k(atp) channels in the rat heart.  here, we have demonstrated that resveratrol ameliorates cardiac hypertrophy, electrocardiographic abnormalities and oxidative stress in the fructose-fed diabetic rat heart. ||| ",yes
Does smoking increase risk for glioblastoma?,"the present study provides some support for a positive association between cigarette smoking and risk of glioma.  on this basis, it has been hypothesized that cigarette smoking may be associated with an increased risk of glioma.  compared with nonsmokers, duration of cigarette smoking, number of cigarettes smoked per day and pack-years of smoking were associated with increased glioma risk, although the increases in risk were relatively modest.  however, two recent cohort studies showed increased risks of glioma among smokers.  after adjustment for confounders, smoking increased the risk of glioma deaths by 11% (odds ratio  = 1.11; 95% confidence interval : 1.03-1.21).  for individuals aged ≥ 50 years, smoking was associated with higher risk of glioma death by 25% (or = 1.25; 95% ci: 1.15-1.38); this increased risk for smokers who smoked ≥ 20 cigarettes daily for ≥ 30 years was 53% (or = 1.53; 95% ci: 1.34-1.74).  we prospectively examined the relation between cigarette smoking and glioma risk among men and women in three large u.s. cohort studies: the health professionals follow-up study (hpfs), the nurses' health study i (nhs), and nhs ii.  although cigarette smoking and alcohol drinking increase the risk of several cancers and certain components of cigarette smoke and alcohol can penetrate the blood-brain barrier, it remains unclear whether these exposures influence the risk of glioma.  this study indicates that smoking is associated with glioma deaths in the chinese population.  we investigated the association between cigarette smoking and glioma risk in the national breast screening study, which included 89,835 canadian women aged 40-59 years at recruitment between 1980 and 1985.  smoking increases the risk of numerous cancers; however, an association of smoking with adult gliomas has not been found in a population.  we examined the associations between cigarette smoking, alcohol intake, and risk of glioma in the national institutes of health-aarp diet and health study, a prospective study of 477,095 us men and women ages 50-71 years at baseline.  among men, current, heavier smoking was associated with a reduced risk of glioma compared with never smoking, but this was based on only nine cases.  among ever smokers, women who reported having quit smoking had a 51% increase in risk of glioma compared with never smokers (hr = 1.51, 95% ci = 0.97-2.34), while current smokers did not appear to have an increase in risk.  when the association with former smokers was further examined by years since quitting, women who had quit smoking >10 years before baseline were at a decreased risk of glioma compared with women who had quit within the 10 years prior to baseline (hr = 0.55, 95% ci = 0.29-1.07), indicating that the association between former smokers and glioma may be driven by women, who recently quit smoking.  cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate incidence rate ratios and 95% confidence intervals between smoking and glioma risk adjusting for age, total meat intake, and alcohol and coffee consumption.  these findings provide strong evidence that cigarette smoking is not associated with an appreciably elevated risk of adult glioma.  cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate hazard ratios (hrs) and 95% confidence intervals (cis) for the association between cigarette smoking and risk of glioma.  we quantified the association between smoking and glioma through a meta-analysis of the literature.  our results demonstrate that cigarette smoking significantly increases lung cancer risk in carriers of a germline p53 mutation. ||| ",no
Does splicing occur co-transcriptionally?,"many splicing events occur co-transcriptionally when the pre-mrna is still associated with the transcription machinery.  splicing is a co-transcriptional process, and different experimental approaches show that splicing is coupled to transcription in drosophila, yeast and mammals.  in the last several years, a number of studies have shown that spliceosome assembly and splicing catalysis can occur co-transcriptionally.  surprisingly, we find that splicing occurs cotranscriptionally for the majority of intron-containing genes.  current evidence supports co-transcriptional spliceosomal assembly, but there is little quantitative information on how much splicing is completed during rna synthesis.  in metazoan organisms, pre-mrna splicing is thought to occur during transcription, and it is postulated that these two processes are functionally coupled via still-unknown mechanisms.  does splicing start while rna polymerase ii is still transcribing?  the functional coupling of transcription and splicing has been reported both in vivo and in vitro, but the molecular mechanisms governing these interactions remain largely unknown.  we discuss here the different mechanisms by which transcription regulates alternative splicing.  recent studies indicate that precursor mrna splicing occurs cotranscriptionally and that nucleosome positioning may influence inclusion of internal exon sequences.  is timing important to control the splicing reaction?  altogether, these findings provide evidence that coupling between transcription and alternative splicing is an important layer of gene expression regulation in plants.  mechanistic analyses of nuclear pre-mrna splicing by the spliceosome and group ii intron self-splicing provide insight into both the catalytic strategies of splicing and the evolutionary relationships between the different splicing systems.  these observations represent the first in vivo evidence for differential association of pre-mrna splicing factors with alternatively spliced transcripts.  splicing in s. cerevisiae has been shown to proceed cotranscriptionally, but the nature of the coupling remains a subject of debate.  increasing evidence suggests that pre-mrna splicing can take place cotranscriptionally in vivo.  alternative splicing regulation not only depends on the interaction of splicing factors with splicing enhancers and silencers in the pre-mrna, but also on the coupling between transcription and splicing.  this coupling is possible because splicing is often cotranscriptional and promoter identity and occupation may affect alternative splicing.  although previous studies suggest that transcription elongation can alter co-transcriptional pre-mrna splicing, we do not observe evidence of defective transcription elongation for these genes in the absence of gcn5, while gcn5-dependent histone acetylation is enriched in the promoter regions.  we show that distinct combinations of splicing factors are recruited to sites of alternatively spliced transcripts in intact cells. ||| ",yes
Does strenuous physical activity affect thyroid hormone metabolism?,"thyroid hormones may influence physical activity levels.  maximal aerobic exercise greatly affects the level of circulating thyroid hormones.  exercise training may cause changes in thyroid function.  thyroid hormones are important regulators of energy metabolism and may influence energy processes during physical exercise.  there are controversial results concerning thyroid hormone metabolism during strenuous exercise in adult athletes and only scant data concerning the impact of strenuous exercise on thyroid hormone metabolism in children and adolescents.  the objective was to evaluate whether a physical exercise session alters the thyroid economy and adrenal axis in humans, and the possible role of corticosteroids in thyroid function disturbance.  the effect of different intensity levels of acute aerobic exercise on thyroid hormones was investigated in 60 male well-trained athletes by performing bicycle ergometer at 45% (low intensity), 70% (moderate intensity), and 90% (high intensity).  although some studies demonstrate a transient change in thyroid hormones during intense physical performance, most studies agree that these changes are of minor impact, practically reflecting the relative negative energy balance during strenuous exercise.  in conclusion, although thyroid hormones are only transiently or insignificantly changed during strenuous exercise, adequate caloric intake should be guaranteed in highly performing young athletes in order to counteract the relative negative energy balance and prevent alterations in endocrine-metabolic profile.  we have investigated the effect of acute aerobic exercise on thyroid hormone values.  acute exercise has been reported to increase thyroid hormone levels and decrease arterial stiffness in healthy young subjects.  effects of exercise on circulating thyroid hormone values remain controversial.  to give new insights into the mechanisms underlying the changes in thyroid economy after exercise, we used a rat model to evaluate the impact of blocking corticosterone synthesis during treadmill exercise by metyrapone administration.  interestingly, the lack of corticosterone peak led not only to lower serum t3, but also to decreased serum t4, indicating that corticosterone might be fundamental for the maintenance of serum thyroid hormone levels after high intensity exercise.  thyroid hormone excess is associated with increased energy expenditure.  the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of acute aerobic exercise on arterial stiffness and thyroid hormone levels, and any relationship between these endpoints, in patients with subclinical hypothyroidism.  further changes in absolute levels of serum tsh in subclinical hypothyroidism may result in reduced cavi improvement by acute aerobic exercise.  the changes in serum tsh from baseline to after exercise were higher, in absolute values, in the subclinical hypothyroidism group than in the euthyroid group (subclinical hypothyroidism group vs euthyroid group; δ serum tsh: - 1.3 ± 1.4 vs. - 0.3 ± 0.5, p < 0.001).  this thyroid response may be due to exercise-induced modulation of energy metabolism but also of the adipocytes endocrine function.  thyroid hormones are important metabolic regulators exerting effects in multiple systemic functions including muscular and cardiorespiratory. ||| ",yes
Does surgery for ovarian endometriomas improve fertility?,"in conclusion, ovarian surgery for the treatment of endometriosis reduces the ovarian outcome in ivf/icsi cycles in women >35 years old, and might also decrease pregnancy rates.  does surgical treatment of endometriomas impact on the ovarian reserve as evaluated with antral follicle count (afc)?  controversy exists regarding surgical management of endometriomas in infertile women before in vitro fertilization (ivf) because growing evidence indicates that surgery may impair the ovarian response.  the laparoscopic excision of ovarian endometriomas appears to increase the chances of spontaneous conception, but the value of this treatment in women selected for ivf-icsi cycles is debated.  to evaluate whether laparoscopic excision of endometrioma exerts a qualitative effect on ovarian function.  to investigate the effect of surgical treatment of endometrioma on pregnancy rate and ovarian response to gonadotrophin stimulation in women undergoing ivf.  findings suggest that surgical management of endometriomas before ivf therapy yields similar live birth rates as expectant management.  therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of previous ovarian surgery for endometriosis on the ovarian response in assisted reproduction treatment cycles and its pregnancy outcome.  literature data suggest that ovarian endometriomas might affect the response to ovarian stimulation and oocyte retrieval.  to test the hypothesis that ovarian surgery for endometrioma compromises ovarian function and accelerates ovarian failure.  does the presence of ovarian endometriomas affect ovarian response to ovarian stimulation after adjusting for age and ovarian reserve markers?  collectively the available data in the literature show that surgical management of endometriomas has no significant effect on ivf pregnancy rates and ovarian response to stimulation compared with no treatment.  we aimed to assess the effect of the pre-cycle surgical removal of endometriomas on ivf outcomes in a large number of cycles in patients undergoing ivf/icsi treatment.  this review addresses: the impact of the endometrioma per se and of its surgical treatment on ovarian physiology, on the ovarian reserve, on spontaneous conception and pregnancy outcomes, and on ivf/icsi outcomes.  first-line surgery for ovarian endometriotic cysts appears associated with a better reproductive performance, that is, a mean postoperative pregnancy rate of ∼50%.  to investigate the effects of ovarian endometrioma on the number of oocytes retrieved for in vitro fertilization (ivf).  however, endometrioma surgery may be considered in the subsequent ivf cycles of patients with lower than expected ovarian response.  the objective of the present systematic review and meta-analysis was to compare surgical and expectant management of endometriomas regarding ivf outcomes.  however, it was recently questioned whether the excision of the endometrioma could decrease the function of the operated ovary and if it could affect the subsequent fertility.  pre-cyle removal of endometrioma may have an adverse impact on ovarian reserve, and pregnancy outcomes seem to be similar with or without surgery in patients undergoing ivf treatment. ||| ",yes
Does temsirolimus improve survival of glioblastoma patients?,"the survival of patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma improved from 2000-2003 to 2005-2008, likely due to temozolomide use.  alternative dosing schedules of temozolomide may improve survival in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma (gbm) by increasing the therapeutic index, overcoming common mechanisms of temozolomide resistance, or both.  standard treatment with temozolomide and radiotherapy for patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma has increased the median overall survival and, more importantly, the 2-year survival rate of patients.  radiation therapy oncology group trial 0525 tested whether dose-intensifying temozolomide versus standard chemoradiotherapy improves overall survival (os) or progression-free survival (pfs) in newly diagnosed glioblastoma.  currently, several clinical trials of dose-dense temozolomide regimen or molecular-targeting therapies have been performed to overcome the resistance of glioblastoma.  temozolomide (tmz), given concurrently with radiotherapy (rt) and as adjuvant monotherapy afterwards, has led to improved survival in glioblastoma multiforme (gbm).  however, with aggressive surgical resection, radiation, and the advent of temozolomide, the overall survival of patients with glioblastomas has improved significantly.  temozolomide-based chemotherapy represents an incremental improvement in the treatment of patients with high-grade gliomas.  notwithstanding a survival benefit in a subset of patients with high-grade gliomas, temozolomide (tmz; temodar®, schering-plough pharmaceuticals, nj, usa) is the primarily palliative treatment for the vast majority of patients.  combined temozolomide and radiotherapy (rt) is the standard postoperative therapy for glioblastoma multiforme (gbm).  combined therapy with temozolomide and radiotherapy is a standard treatment and improves the survival for patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma.  a recent randomized study conducted on newly diagnosed glioblastoma (gbm) patients demonstrated that concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide added to standard radiotherapy had a survival advantage compared with radiotherapy alone.  second-line treatment with continuous dose-intense tmz may prolong survival in patients with recurrent glioblastoma.  the aim of this study is to offer survival following reirradiation (re-rt) using intensity-modulated radiation therapy (imrt) with temozolomide in selected patients with recurrent high grade gliomas.  temozolomide is recommended as superior to procarbazine in patients with first relapse of glioblastoma after having received nitrosourea chemotherapy or no prior cytotoxic chemotherapy at the time of initial therapy.  laboratory and clinical data suggest that the anti-angiogenic agent, thalidomide, if combined with cytotoxic agents, may be effective against recurrent glioblastoma multiforme (gbm).  what is the impact of cytotoxic chemotherapy on disease control and survival in the adult patient with progressive glioblastoma?  we performed a retrospective review of 67 patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma treated with rt/tmz between 2003-2007.  we identified patients with histologically confirmed glioblastoma and world health organization grade iii glioma who were previously treated with temozolomide plus radiotherapy and received 10 mg/kg bevacizumab intravenous infusion every 2 weeks until disease progression for recurrent disease.  tumor-treating fields (ttfields) is an emerging treatment modality for glioblastoma (gbm). ||| ",no
Does the 3D structure of  the genome remain stable during cell differentiation?,"the 3d structure of the genome plays a key role in regulatory control of the cell.  three-dimensional (3d) genome structures vary from cell to cell even in an isogenic sample.  the three-dimensional (3d) structure of the genome is important for orchestration of gene expression and cell differentiation.  the eukaryotic genome adopts in the cell nucleus a 3-dimensional configuration that varies with cell types, developmental stages and environmental condition as well as between normal and pathological states.  it is assumed that the genome of a higher eukaryotic organism is organized into a number of distinct three-dimensional (3-d) structures, each characteristic for a given differentiated state.  in this review, we focus on the physical nature of the 3d genome architecture.  however, how the 3d genome organization and its dynamics influence cellular phenotypes remains poorly understood.  the three-dimensional (3d) organization of the genome is intimately related to numerous key biological functions including gene expression and dna replication regulations.  the three-dimensional (3d) genome organization and its role in biological activities have been investigated for over a decade in the field of cell biology.  here, we discuss the current state of studies of 3d genome folding and the relation of this folding to the functional organization of the genome.  these discrete 3-d structures are envisioned to develop in a hierarchical and largely irreversible manner from an omnipotent 3-d structure of the zygotic genome.  the three-dimensional organization of chromatin is expected to play critical roles in regulating genome functions.  the observation in many species that 3d domains correlate strongly with the 1d epigenomic information along the genome suggests a dynamic coupling between chromatin organization and epigenetic regulation.  the 3d organization of the genome facilitates gene regulation, replication, and repair, making it a key feature of genomic function and one that remains to be properly understood.  the regulation of these proteins, their interaction with dna, and their co-occurrence in the genome, may be responsible for the plasticity of 3d chromatin architecture that dictates cell and time-specific blueprints of gene expression.  the mechanisms by which molecular drivers functionally organize the 3d genome, such as topologically associating domains (tads), remain to be explored.  here, we discuss the evolution of 3c-based technologies for mapping 3d genome organization.  by applying these methods to real hi-c data, we highlighted a temporal hierarchy embedded in the 3d genome organization; chromatin interaction boundaries are more rigid than the boundary interior, while functional domains emerge as dynamic fluctuations within a particular time interval.  the dynamic three-dimensional chromatin architecture of genomes and its co-evolutionary connection to its function-the storage, expression, and replication of genetic information-is still one of the central issues in biology.  the genome of pluripotent stem cells adopts a unique three-dimensional architecture featuring weakly condensed heterochromatin and large nucleosome-free regions. ||| ",no
Does the Abelson-related gene (ARG) gene encode for a serine kinase?,"arg and c-abl represent the mammalian members of the abelson family of protein-tyrosine kinases.  the products of the human arg gene and the human abl gene characterize the abelson family of non-receptor tyrosine protein kinases.  arg and c-abl represent the mammalian member of the abelson family of nonreceptor protein tyrosine kinases.  the products of the human arg gene and human, mouse, drosophila, and nematode abl genes characterize the abelson family of nonreceptor tyrosine protein kinase.  the arg gene, expressed as a 12-kb transcript, codes a protein highly related to c-abl in the tyrosine kinase, sh2, and sh3 domains, and both proteins have a myristoylated isoform.  abl2/arg (abl-related gene) belongs to the abl (abelson tyrosine-protein kinase) family of tyrosine kinases.  abl2 (also known as arg (abl related gene)) is closely related to the well-studied abelson kinase cabl.  arg plays important roles in cell morphogenesis, motility, growth and survival, and many of these biological roles overlap with the cellular functions of the abl kinase.  the abl family of mammalian nonreceptor tyrosine kinases consists of c-abl and arg (abl-related gene).  previously, we have shown that in abelson-transformed cells, the abelson kinase regulates the phosphoserine content of ribosomal protein s6.  the abelson (c-abl) proto-oncogene encodes a highly conserved nonreceptor protein tyrosine kinase that plays a role in cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis and cell adhesion.  arg, however, has no known function in cell signaling.  argbp2 associates with and is a substrate of arg and v-abl, and is phosphorylated on tyrosine in v-abl-transformed cells.  we have investigated three models whereby the abelson kinase might regulate s6 phosphorylation via the activation of protein kinase c. first, the abelson kinase could phosphorylate protein kinase c on tyrosine.  the transforming protein of the abelson murine leukaemia virus encodes a protein-tyrosine kinase.  these observations indicate that the c-terminal domain regulates arg biological activity in a manner distinct from c-abl and suggest that this effect may be mediated in part by sh3 domain-binding sites.  a novel arg/abl-binding protein, argbp2, was isolated using a segment of the arg cooh-terminal domain as bait in the yeast two-hybrid system.  the present studies demonstrate that arg associates with the proapoptotic siva-1 protein.  this paper shows that the kinase domain of ark1 autophosphorylates on serine and threonine residues when expressed as a recombinant fusion protein.  argbp2 contains three cooh-terminal src homology 3 domains, a serine/threonine-rich domain, and several potential abl phosphorylation sites. ||| ",no
Does the CTCF protein co-localize with cohesin?,"taken together, our results demonstrate that specific sites on the c terminus of ctcf are essential for cohesin binding and insulator function.  here we show that a segment within the ctcf n terminus interacts with the sa2-scc1 subunits of human cohesin.  ctcf is dispensable for cohesin loading onto dna, but is needed to enrich cohesin at specific binding sites.  cohesin frequently colocalizes with ctcf (ccctc-binding factor), affecting genomic stability, expression and epigenetic homeostasis.  we show here that the interaction of ctcf with the cohesin complex involves direct contacts between the cohesin subunit sa2 and specific regions of the c-terminal tail of ctcf.  in mammalian genomes, cohesin co-localizes with ccctc binding factor (ctcf), a zinc finger protein implicated in multiple gene regulatory events.  the binding of cohesin to euchromatic regions is largely mediated by ctcf or the mediator complex.  most of these interactions involve recruitment of the cohesin complex to chromatin via ctcf.  we demonstrate that this interaction is specifically required for ctcf-anchored loops and contributes to the positioning of cohesin at ctcf binding sites.  recent studies have shown that the protein ctcf, which plays an important role in insulation and in large-scale organization of chromatin within the eukaryotic nucleus, depends for both activities on recruitment of the cohesin complex.  cohesin subunits are mutated in cancer, but ctcf/cohesin-binding sites (cbss) in dna have not been examined for mutations.  the only direct interaction between ctcf and cohesin involves contact with sa2, which is external to the cohesin ring.  functionally, ctcf associates with thousands of genomic sites and interacts with proteins, such as cohesin, or non-coding rnas to facilitate specific transcriptional programming.  cohesin catalyses the folding of the genome into loops that are anchored by ctcf1.  recent studies show that ctcf recruits the cohesin complex to insulator sites and that cohesin is required for insulator activity.  we find that ctcf also interacts with the centromeric protein cenp-e both in vitro and in vivo.  sites of ctcf and cohesinsa-1 co-occupancy were enriched in gene promoters in hspc and erythroid cells compared to single ctcf or cohesin sites.  cohesin is implicated in establishing tissue-specific dna loops that target enhancers to promoters, and also localizes to sites bound by the insulator protein ctcf, which blocks enhancer-promoter communication.  a number of factors have been reported to co-localize with ctcf and regulate ctcf loops, but no comprehensive analysis of binding partners has been performed.  ctcf and cohesinsa-1 are regulatory proteins involved in a number of critical cellular processes including transcription, maintenance of chromatin domain architecture, and insulator function. ||| ",yes
Does the Oncotype DX test work with paraffin embedded tissues?,"the oncotype dx colon cancer assay is a new diagnostic test for determining the likelihood of recurrence in stage ii colon cancer patients after surgical resection using fixed paraffin embedded (fpe) primary colon tumor tissue.  one hundred and twenty samples from august 2006 to november 2010 that underwent oncotype dx testing were analyzed.  the oncotype dx assay is one of the molecular tests that provide predictive and prognostic information to breast cancer patients with estrogen receptor (er)-positive and node-negative disease.  the oncotype dx test is a genomic test currently used in clinical practice to predict the risk of disease recurrence in estrogen receptor (er)-positive, her2-negative breast cancer patients with axillary lymph node-negative or micrometastatic disease.  recent data suggest that immunohistochemistry (er, pr, her2, and ki-67) and histologic subtype may identify patients that will not benefit from oncotype dx testing.  a total of 371 patients underwent oncotype dx testing at our institution from 2012 to 2016.  oncotype dx is a genetic test that has been incorporated into the 2017 ajcc breast cancer staging system for er positive, her2-negative, lymph node-negative patients to predict the risk of recurrence.  the oncotype dx genomic test is a treatment decision-making tool.  oncotype dx® test is beneficial in predicting recurrence free survival in estrogen receptor positive (er+) breast cancer.  oncotype dx (odx) is a multigene assay that is prognostic and predictive in estrogen receptor (er) positive early breast cancer.  oncotype dx (odx) is a widely used commercial assay that estimates the risk of distant recurrence and may predict the benefit of chemotherapy in a subset of breast cancers.  oncotype dx (odx) is a tumor gene-profiling test that aids in adjuvant chemotherapy decision-making.  oncotype dx  is an approved prognostic tool for women with node-negative, hormone receptor-positive, her2-negative breast cancer.  the oncomine dx target test (odxtt) is a next-generation sequencing-based companion diagnostic test which has been recently developed; however, its analysis success rate could be improved, especially for small samples.  since 2014, the oncotype dx test has been funded at the cancer treatment centres in our province for patients with early breast cancer.  like the oncotype dx breast cancer assay, this is a high complexity, multi-analyte, reverse transcription (rt) polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay that measures the expression levels of specific cancer-related genes.  significant findings of the study: we found that a tissue surface area > 1.04 mm2 and tumor cell count >375 cells had a positive effect on the analysis success rate of odxtt in the analysis of biopsy tissue samples.  we question the utility of performing oncotype dx in subtypes of invasive carcinoma that are associated with excellent prognosis.  the oncotype dx test results appeared to successfully guide the adjuvant treatment given to patients in accordance to recurrence score-based recommendations.  we propose that immunohistochemistry for er, pr, and her2 is sufficient for patients with low-grade invasive carcinomas and can be used as a surrogate for oncotype dx. ||| ",yes
Does the TOP2B/TOP2A expression ratio affect the response to AML chemotherapy?,"the emergence of therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia (t-aml) has been associated with dna topoisomerase ii (top2)-targeted drug treatments and chromosomal translocations frequently involving the mll, or all-1, gene.  bcl-2 over-expression is associated with cd34 positivity, poor response to chemotherapy and reduced overall survival in aml patients.  in order to define the clinical relevance of the bcl-2 mrna expression in acute myeloid leukemia (aml) and its correlation to therapy outcome and prognosis, we analyzed 219 aml bone marrow (bm) samples, including 119 patients with de novo aml at presentation, 37 with aml following myelodysplastic syndrome (mds), as well as 42 bm samples of aml in relapse and 21 in complete remission (cr) using rt-pcr.  therefore, the high bcl-2 concentration levels remaining after treatment with anti-leukaemia drugs can be responsible for resistance to chemotherapy by protecting cd34 positive aml cells from induced apoptosis.  do patients with therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia (t-aml) have a poor prognosis independent of other predictive variables such as cytogenetics or molecular determinants?  the role of bcl-2 in determining the response of aml cells to two chemotherapy drugs used in treatment of aml: cytarabine and fludarabine was investigated using human leukaemia cell lines expressing different levels of bcl-2: u937 cd34 negative expressing low levels of bcl-2 and mhh225 cd34 positive expressing high levels of bcl-2.  recent studies have shown that abgg2 protein overexpression in acute myeloid leukemia (aml) may be associated with poor response to therapy and increased relapse risk.  concerning the long-term outcome, the overall (os) and disease-free survival (dfs) was significantly worse in aml patients with high expression levels of bcl-2 mrna.  acute myeloid leukaemia (aml) is a heterogeneous malignant disease in which bcl-2 is expressed simultaneously with several putative drug resistance parameters in aml cells.  expression of the bcl-2 oncoprotein by aml blasts has previously been demonstrated to be heterogenous with high levels of bcl-2 expression being associated with a low complete remission rate and poor survival.  previously, we demonstrated that the level of bcl2 expression is prognostic in acute myelogenous leukemia (aml).  altered expression of members of the bcl-2 family might account for the observed apoptosis resistance to chemotherapy in acute myeloid leukemia (aml).  elmpcr provides a new tool for investigating the role of dna topoisomerases in fundamental genetic processes and translocations associated with cancer treatments involving topoisomerase-targeted drugs.  aml patients with high bcl-2 mrna expression achieved lower cr rates than those with no or low expression.  two distinct mechanisms have been implicated as potential triggers of t-aml translocations: top2-mediated dna cleavage and apoptotic higher-order chromatin fragmentation.  these results suggest that expression levels of proteins that affect the functional status of bcl2 modify the prognostic impact of bcl2 and suggest that the role of apoptosis in different cases of aml varies independently in the different cytogenetic subgroups.  the bcl-2 oncoprotein is suggested to be directly involved in the emergence of drug resistance by disrupting or delaying the apoptotic program and promoting tumor survival.  our results suggest that the poor prognosis previously associated with aml blasts expressing the cd34 antigen may in part be related to high expression of bcl-2.  cytogenetic abnormalities detected at diagnosis are recognized as important in predicting response to chemotherapy in acute myeloid leukemia (aml).  the localization and remarkable clustering of the t-aml breakpoints cannot be explained simply by the dna cleavage patterns but might result from potential interactions between top2 poisoning, apoptotic dna cleavage, and dna repair attempts at specific sites of higher-order chromatin structure in apoptosis-evading cells. ||| ",yes
Does the association of PARP1 and CTCF follow a circadian rhythm?,"here, we report the discovery that poly(c)-binding protein 1 (pcbp1), displaying a circadian expression pattern, was a novel circadian clock regulator.  the circadian transcription factor clock exhibits a circadian oscillation in its phosphorylation levels.  the core-circadian pathway (p = 0.0006) was significantly associated to prostate cancer, for either low (p = 0.002) or high (p = 0.01) grade tumor.  here, we obtained direct evidence that clock phosphorylation may be essential for autonomous circadian oscillation in clock gene expression.  circadian clock genes have the function of producing circadian rhythm.  given that the rna interference of mushroom-body expressed (mub), the poly(rc) binding protein (pcbp) homolog of drosophila, in the clock neurons also led to a circadian phenotype in the locomotor assay, our study deemed pcbp1 a novel clock modifier whose circadian regulatory mechanism is conserved during evolution.  we investigated the expression pattern of circadian clock genes and evaluated their prognostic values in paad.  collectively, our findings first demonstrate that piwil1 negatively regulates circadian rhythms via two pathways, providing molecular connection between dysfunction of circadian rhythms and tumorigenesis.  abnormal expressions and circadian rhythm alterations of per1 are closely related to carcinogenesis.  here we report that piwil1 can suppress circadian rhythms in cancer cells.  this study determined whether the core circadian gene, clock, had a regulatory role in the development of psoriasis.  the circadian clock regulates daily variations in physiologic processes.  accumulating studies indicate that circadian clock genes are pivotal regulators of tumorigenesis and development of various cancers.  these discoveries shed new light on the role of core circadian proteins in various cellular and physiological processes.  clock acts as a regulator in the circadian apparatus controlling the expression of other clock genes, including per1.  circadian rhythms misalignment is associated with hypertension.  the cardiovascular diseases are closely related to circadian rhythm, which is under the control of the biological clock.  although it remains unclear whether this phosphorylation contributes to circadian rhythm generation, it has been suggested to be involved in transcriptional activity, intracellular localization, and degradative turnover of clock.  we aim to investigate the relationship between circadian genes polymorphisms and prostate cancer risk based on data from the epicap study, a population-based case-control study including 1,515 men (732 cases / 783 controls) with genotyped data.  the circadian clock governs our daily cycle of behavior and physiology. ||| ",yes
"Does the concentration of protein HIF-1α increase after the administration of the cytoprotective prodrug""amifostine"" (ethyol) ?","second, we examined some aspects of hif-1 activity regulation in hgf-treated cells with the following findings: (i) the activation of hif-1 dna binding was prevented by proteasome blockade, probably because stabilization of the cytosolic alpha-subunit protein level is not sufficient to generate a functional form: also under these conditions nuclear protein level of hif-1alpha did not increase; (ii) n-acetylcysteine, a free radical scavenger, strongly decreased hif-1 activation suggesting a role of reactive oxygen species in this process; (iii) the thiol reducing agent dithiothreitol was ineffective.  an increased expression of hif-1alpha (mrna and nuclear protein levels) was observed.  ectopic overexpression of p53 also led to an inhibition of hif-1 activity.  these results suggest that hif-1alphaz functions as a dominant-negative isoform of hif-1 by sequestering arnt in the cytosol.  involvement of hif1a and epas1 (also known as hif2a), two hif isoforms expressed in trophoblasts, was shown by treating another group of cells cultured under 2.5% o2 with specific inhibitors of hif1a and epas1 for 16 h. inha mrna expression was assessed by real-time pcr and secreted inhibin a was quantified by elisa.  an increase in the levels of hif-1α in the psoriatic lesions and the serum of psoriatic patients has been reported.  ectopically expressed arnt was consistently able to enhance hif-1alpha phosphorylation in a binding-dependent manner.  acriflavine (acf) binds hif-1α and hif-2α preventing binding to hif-1β and inhibiting transcriptional activity of hif-1 and hif-2.  furthermore, when cells in which hif-1 had been induced by dfo were also treated with flavonoids, the transcriptional activity of hif-1 was strongly impaired without simultaneous reduction in hif-1alpha protein levels.  this increase was in parallel with a decrease in hif-1 activity without changes in hif-1alpha protein level, indicating a regulation of its transcriptional activity.  in addition to regulation of hif-1alpha protein level, hif-1 activity is also enhanced by several pathways involving asparagine hydroxylation and phosphorylation.  initial increase of hif1alpha-2 mrna expression and subsequent return to baseline levels was not different between twelve men and nine women.  however, hif-1α-induced autophagy augments apoptosis and oxidative stress.  in this study, the role of albumin-bound fatty acids in the albumin-induced hif-1 activation was studied.  in vitro, in human prostate (15pc3, pc3, and du145) and glioblastoma (u373) cells, ezn-2968 induced a potent, selective, and durable antagonism of hif-1 mrna and protein expression (ic(50), 1-5 nmol/l) under normoxic and hypoxic conditions associated with inhibition of tumor cell growth.  moreover, electrophoretic mobility assay revealed a specific hif-1 binding activity to the caspase-3 gene promoter.  here we show that an important tumor suppressor protein, p14arf (alternative reading frame product of the ink4a locus) can directly inhibit the transcriptional activity of hif-1 by sequestering its alpha subunit into the nucleolus.  accordingly, the drug therapy directed to control hif-1α levels may effectively manage the disease.  the fa(+)hsa treatment induced hif-1 target gene mrnas such as those of glucose transporter 1 (glut1), glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gapdh), and breast cancer resistance protein (bcrp) in concentration-dependent manners, while fa(-)hsa caused no significant increases in these mrnas.  recently, it has been shown that increases in free dna in the plasma induce expression of hif1alpha. ||| ",yes
Does the hERG gene code for a protein which is part of a sodium channel?,"the voltage-gated 'glial' sodium channel nag belongs to a distinct molecular class within the multi-gene family of mammalian sodium channels.  the sodium channel nav1.6, encoded by the gene scn8a, is one of the major voltage-gated channels in human brain.  immunohistochemistry, western blot, and quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase pcr analysis were used to quantify sodium channel subunit protein and mrna expression in the san.  what is the relationship between sodium channel function, neuronal function and clinical status in channelopathies of the nervous system?  voltage-gated sodium channels comprise an ion-selective α-subunit and one or more associated β-subunits.  the cardiac voltage-gated sodium channel (gene: scn5a, protein: nav1.5) is responsible for the sodium current that initiates the cardiomyocyte action potential.  the expression of β-subunits together with α subunits enhances the na(+) current and modifies the channel activities.  the β3-subunit (encoded by the scn3b gene) is an important physiological regulator of the heart-specific sodium channel, nav1.5.  cardiac sodium channels are transmembrane proteins distributed in atrial and ventricular myocytes and purkinje fibers.  sodium channel 6 (nach6) is the alpha-subunit of a voltage-gated sodium channel expressed in the rat nervous system.  the voltage-gated sodium channel is a transmembrane protein essential for the generation of action potentials in excitable cells.  cardiac sodium channel is composed of a pore-forming α-subunit and one or two accessory β-subunits.  they comprise an α (navα) subunit that forms the channel pore and are coupled to one or more auxiliary β (navβ) subunits that modulate the gating to a variable extent.  the voltage-gated sodium channel  has recently been found in cardiac myocytes.  it has been reported that sodium channels purified from the electric organ of the electric eel, electrophorus electricus, and from chick cardiac muscle consist of a single polypeptide of relative molecular mass (mr) approximately 260,000, whereas those purified from rat brain and from rat and rabbit skeletal muscle contain, in addition to the large polypeptide, one or two smaller polypeptides of mr 33,000-43,000.  a common human epithelial sodium channel (enac) polymorphism, alphat663a, is present in the cytoplasmic c terminus of the alpha-subunit, although it is unclear whether this polymorphism segregates with blood pressure.  voltage-gated sodium channels composed of pore-forming alpha and auxiliary beta subunits are responsible for the rising phase of the action potential in cardiac muscle, but the functional roles of distinct sodium channel subtypes have not been clearly defined.  here we report that the messenger rnas generated by transcription of the cloned cdnas encoding the rat brain sodium channel large polypeptides, when injected into xenopus oocytes, can direct the formation of functional sodium channels.  the neuronal voltage-gated sodium channel na(v)1.1 encoded by the scn1a gene plays an important role in the generation and propagation of action potentials in the central nervous system.  (1) background: voltage-gated sodium channels (navs) are integral membrane proteins that allow the sodium ion flux into the excitable cells and initiate the action potential. ||| ",no
Does the histidine-rich Ca-binding protein (HRC) interact with triadin?,"a direct binding of hrc (histidine-rich ca(2+)-binding protein) to triadin, the main transmembrane protein of the junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum (sr) of skeletal muscle, seems well supported.  because hrc appears to interact directly with triadin, hrc may play a role in the regulation of ca(2+) release during excitation-contraction coupling.  histidine-rich calcium binding protein (hrc) is located in the lumen of sarcoplasmic reticulum (sr) that binds to both triadin (trn) and serca affecting ca(2+) cycling in the sr.  the hrc effects on ryr may be regulated by the ca(2+)-sensitivity of its interaction with triadin.  the present study documents the binding interaction of skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum (sr) transmembrane protein triadin with peripheral histidine-rich, ca(2+)-binding protein (hcp).  here, we characterized the cooh-terminal portion of rabbit hrc, expressed and purified as a fusion protein (hrc(569-852)), with respect to ca(2+)-binding properties, and to the interaction with triadin on blots, as a function of the concentration of ca(2+).  hrc (histidine-rich ca2+ binding protein) has been identified from skeletal and cardiac muscle and shown to bind ca2+ with low affinity and high capacity that is reminiscent of calsequestrin.  suggesting that triadin dually interacts with hcp and with cs, at distinct sites, we have found that triadin-cs interaction in overlays does not require the presence of ca2+.  the histidine-rich ca(2+) binding protein (hrc) is a high capacity ca(2+) binding protein in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (sr).  the histidine-rich calcium binding protein (hrc) is a novel regulator of sarcoplasmic reticulum (sr) ca(2+)-uptake, storage and release.  triadin is a protein first identified as a member of the muscle calcium release complex, involved in calcium release for muscle contraction.  we demonstrate that hrc can be isolated as a complex with triadin, following equilibrium sucrose-density centrifugation in the presence of mm ca(2+).  we observed that hrcn1 binds ca(2+) in a cooperative manner and the ca(2+) binding caused an increase in the α-helix content of hrcn1.  we show a specific binding interaction between digoxigenin-hcp and triadin, using ligand blot techniques.  the putative role(s) of triadin(s) will be discussed here.  the binding between intact triadin or expressed triadin peptides and the ryanodine receptor has been investigated using membrane overlay and affinity chromatography.  colocalization of hcp and triadin at junctional triads is supported by the overlapping staining pattern using monoclonal antibodies to triadin.  our results identify the polyglutamic stretch near the cooh terminus, as the ca(2+)-binding site responsible, both for the acceleration in mobility of hrc on sds-page in the presence of millimolar concentrations of ca(2+), and for the enhancement by high ca(2+) of the interaction between hrc and triadin cytoplasmic segment.  in fact, in vitro generated evidence suggests that hrc directly interacts with sr ca(2+)-atpase2, supporting a dual role of hrc in ca(2+)-homeostasis: regulation of both sr ca(2+)-uptake and ca(2+)-release.  these observations indicate two types of binding between triadin and the ryanodine receptor: (1) a low-affinity ionic interaction of large portions of triadin; (2) a specific high-affinity binding of a short relatively hydrophobic segment. ||| ",yes
Does the histone chaperone ASF1 interact with histones H1/H2?,"interactions with both h3 and h4 were required for asf1 histone chaperone function in vivo and in vitro.  here we report the structure of a histone/histone chaperone interaction.  asf1 is a highly conserved histone h3/h4 chaperone that synergizes in vitro with two other histone chaperones, chromatin assembly factor 1 (caf-1) and histone repression a factor (hira), in dna synthesis-coupled and dna synthesis-independent nucleosome assembly.  asf1 is a histone chaperone that favors histone h3/h4 assembly and disassembly.  histone chaperones are involved in a variety of chromatin transactions.  the histone chaperone asf1 assists in chromatin assembly and remodeling during replication, transcription activation, and gene silencing.  by a proteomics survey, we identified the interaction networks of histone chaperones asf1, caf1, hira, and nap1.  the histone h3/h4 chaperone asf1p is highly conserved and is involved in dna replication, dna repair, and transcription.  snasp and asf1 are conserved histone chaperones that interact with histones h3 and h4 and are found in a multi-chaperoning complex in vivo previously we identified a short peptide motif within h3 that binds to the tpr domain of snasp with nanomolar affinity.  the protein anti-silencing function 1 (asf1) chaperones histones h3/h4 for assembly into nucleosomes every cell cycle as well as during dna transcription and repair.  the geometry of the interaction indicates that asf1 binds to histones h3/h4 in a manner that likely blocks sterically the h3/h3 interface of the nucleosomal four-helix bundle.  investigations on chromatin assembly in vitro implicate chromatin assembly factor 1 (caf1) as a chaperone for histones h3/h4 and nucleosome assembly protein 1 (nap1) as a chaperone for histones h2a/h2b.  asf1 is known to directly bind histone h3, however, high-resolution structural information about the geometry of this interaction was previously unknown.  anti-silencing function 1 (asf1) is an evolutionarily conserved histone h3-h4 chaperone involved in the assembly/disassembly of nucleosome and histone modification.  the hira histone chaperone complex, composed of hira, ubinuclein-1 (ubn1) and cabin1, cooperates with the histone chaperone asf1a to mediate h3.3-specific binding and chromatin deposition.  here, we identify mutants of histones h3.1 and h3.3 that are unable to interact with human asf1a and asf1b isoforms but that are still competent to bind caf-1 and hira, respectively.  histone chaperones are proteins that interact with histones to regulate the thermodynamic process of nucleosome assembly.  the ability of histone chaperone anti-silencing factor 1 (asf1) to direct acetylation of lysine 56 of histone h3 (h3k56ac) represents an important regulatory step in genome replication and dna repair.  the histone h3/h4 chaperone asf1 (anti-silencing function 1) is required for the establishment and maintenance of proper chromatin structure, as well as for genome stability in eukaryotes.  chromatin assembly factor 1 (caf-1) is a histone h3-h4 chaperone that deposits newly synthesized histone (h3-h4)2 tetramers during replication-coupled nucleosome assembly. ||| ",no
Does the human lncRNA LINC-PINT promote tumorigenesis?,"lncrna linc00511 (linc00511) has been confirmed to act as a tumor promoter in several tumors.  linc00511 is a newly identified lncrna that is up-regulated in many types of human cancers and may serve as an oncogenic lncrna.  recent studies have indicated the crucial regulator roles of a long non-coding rna (lncrna) linc00673 in cancer pathogenesis and development.  these findings indicated that linc-pint functions as a tumour-suppressor that exerts important regulatory roles in nsclc progression by sponging mir-208a-3p/pdcd4.  the lncrna linc00339 was reported to regulate the development of lung cancer or breast cancer.  lncrna linc00511 (linc00511) has been proved to serve as an oncogene in several tumors.  long noncoding rna (lncrna) long intergenic nonprotein-coding rna, p53-induced transcript (linc-pint) has shown anti-invasive activity in lung and colon cancer cells.  the long noncoding rna (lncrna) linc00520 is an important modulator of the oncogenicity of multiple human cancers.  lncrna linc01510 (linc01510) was a newly identified tumor-related lncrna whose dysregulation and potential function have been reported in several tumors.  recently, accumulating data have supported that long non-coding rnas (lncrnas) may contribute to tumorigenesis.  in conclusion, linc00511 acts as oncogenic lncrna in cervical cancer, and may be a novel biomarker and potential therapeutic target for cervical cancer patients.  lncrna linc01561 (linc01561) is a newly identified tumor-related lncrna and its dysregulation has been demonstrated in several tumors.  increasing researches have revealed a critical role of long noncoding rnas (lncrnas) in tumor progression.  long noncoding rnas (lncrnas) have been shown to have critical regulatory roles in tumorigenesis.  mounting evidence indicates that the long non-coding rna (lncrna) linc00460 plays an oncogenic role in tumor progression; however, the role of linc00460 in cervical cancer (cc) remains unknown.  long noncoding rna (lncrna) linc00673 has been proven to play critical roles in cancer biology, while its role in other diseases is unknown.  linc00520 functioned as an oncogenic lncrna in ptc, and it facilitated ptc progression by regulating the mir-577/sphk2 axis, suggesting that the linc00520/mir-577/sphk2 axis is an effective target in anticancer management.  long noncoding rna (lncrna) plays a critical role in tumorigenesis.  long non-coding rna linc00173 (linc00173) has been shown to facilitate the progression of a number of malignancies.  how lncrna regulates laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (lscc) progression remains poorly understood. ||| ",no
Does the majority of the mitochondrial genomes abide to the second parity rule (PR2)?,"mammalian mitochondrial dna (mtdna) is replicated by the heterotrimeric pol γ comprised of a single catalytic subunit, encoded by polg, and a homodimeric accessory subunit encoded by the polg2 gene.  the established strand-displacement model for mammalian mitochondrial dna (mtdna) replication has recently been questioned in light of new data using two-dimensional (2d) agarose gel electrophoresis.  polymerase (dna directed), gamma 2, accessory subunit, also known as polg2, is involved in mitochondrial replication.  polg2(+/-) mice are haplosufficient and develop normally with no discernable difference in mitochondrial function through 2 years of age.  human mitochondrial dna (mtdna) polymerase γ (pol γ) is the sole enzyme required to replicate and maintain the integrity of the mitochondrial genome.  our data indicate that polg2 function is critical to mammalian embryogenesis and mtdna replication, and that a single copy of polg2 is sufficient to sustain life.  rpm2p influences the level of mrnas that encode components of the mitochondrial import apparatus and essential mitochondrial chaperones.  after polg2 knockdown, the mitochondrial dna copy number was significantly (p < 0.05) lower than that in the control group.  although two main hypotheses of mitochondrial origin have been proposed, i.e., the autogenous and the endosymbiotic, only the second is being seriously considered currently.  it provides critical insights into complex ii function with implications for understanding complex ii's role in mitochondrial diseases across eukaryotes.  human mitochondrial dna is replicated by the two-subunit dna polymerase gamma (polgamma).  new mitochondria contain their own genome with a modified genetic code that is highly conserved among mammals.  since 1970, the dna polymerase gamma (polg) has been known to be the dna polymerase responsible for replication and repair of mitochondrial dna, and until recently it was generally accepted that this was the only polymerase present in mitochondria.  this paper summarizes recent advances in understanding the links between the cell's ability to maintain integrity of its mitochondrial genome and mitochondrial genetic diseases.  deletions within 5' or 3' regions of the mrp rna gene produced transcripts that remain competent for mitochondrial targeting.  the mechanism of replication of mammalian mitochondrial dna (mtdna) has recently been a topic of controversy.  the mechanism of mitochondrial dna replication is a subject of intense debate.  pb2 associates with mitochondria and inhibits the function of the mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein mavs, implicating pb2 in the regulation of innate immune responses.  we found that pb2 is imported into the mitochondrial matrix and showed that amino acid residue 9 is a determinant of mitochondrial import.  the rpm2 gene of saccharomyces cerevisiae codes for a protein subunit of mitochondrial rnase p and has another unknown essential function. ||| ",no
Does the protein mTOR regulate autophagy?,"mtorc1 regulates protein synthesis positively and autophagy negatively.  one of the key regulators of autophagy is the mammalian target of rapamycin (mtor), a conserved serine/threonine kinase which suppresses the initiation of the autophagic process when nutrients, growth factors, and energy are available.  mtor signaling is a central regulator of autophagy by modulating multiple aspects of the autophagy process, such as initiation, process, and termination through controlling the activity of the unc51-like kinase 1 (ulk1) complex and vacuolar protein sorting 34 (vps34) complex, and the intracellular distribution of tfeb/tfe3 and proto-lysosome tubule reformation.  an increasing amount of evidence indicates that mtor and autophagy are critical for the pathogenesis of pd.  although mammalian target of rapamycin (mtor) is known as the key regulator of autophagy induction, the mechanism by which mtor regulates autophagy has remained elusive.  in this review, we will summarize recent advances regarding the roles of mtor and autophagy in pd pathogenesis and treatment.  both mtor and autophagy are suggested to be involved in the viral infection.  mtor (mammalian target of rapamycin) signalling and macroautophagy (henceforth autophagy) regulate numerous pathological and physiological processes, including cellular responses to altered nutrient levels.  targeting mtor for therapeutic interventions in cancer through autophagy pathway is challenging due to the dual roles of autophagy in tumor progression.  the mammalian target of rapamycin (mtor), which is the foremost negative controller of autophagy, plays a key role in many endogenous processes.  mammalian target of rapamycin (mtor) (a serine/threonine protein kinase) is a major repressor of autophagy, a cell survival mechanism.  inhibition of mtor, e.g., by small molecules such as rapamycin, results in activation of autophagy.  however, the mechanisms regulating mtor and autophagy remain incompletely understood.  this study provides a direct evidence of the role of mtor and its downstream modulation of autophagy in articular cartilage homeostasis.  upregulation of mtor expression co-relates with increased chondrocyte apoptosis and reduced expression of key autophagy genes during oa.  the mammalian target of rapamycin (mtorc1) has been shown to regulate autophagy at different steps.  it has been colocalized to mitochondria and the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mtor), a suppressor of autophagy.  rapamycin is a selective inhibitor of mtor, and induces autophagy in various systems.  the mammalian target of rapamycin (mtor) is a key regulator of cell growth, autophagy, translation, and survival.  these findings demonstrate that the ulk-atg13-fip200 complexes are direct targets of mtor and important regulators of autophagy in response to mtor signaling. ||| ",yes
Does the word ovine refers to goats?,"the goat is an important farm animal.  the domestic goat (capra hircus), an important livestock species, belongs to a clade of ruminantia, bovidae, together with cattle, buffalo and sheep.  the ovary is the most important reproductive organ for goats.  in the usa, goats are primarily infected with bovine strains of paratuberculosis and sheep are primarily infected with ovine strains.  reproduction is an important process of goat farming.  however, in contrast to cattle, there is a lack of reference information on this topic in goats.  during the spring of 2 years, goat kids grazed on a cattle pasture acquired o. ostertagi infections which included adult worms, but a larger number of early l4.  active omasal motility was recorded in 20 goats with 0.3 to 2.0 contractions per minute.  goats offer benefits compared to cattle because of size and tractability and compared to sheep with regard to specific features of their anatomy.  the findings of this study provide reference ranges for the interpretation of the location and size of the omasum in goats with suspected omasal abnormalities.  the aim of this research reflection is to describe the basic rumen function of goats and its modification in response to environmental factors, as well as to discuss similarities and differences when compared to other ruminants.  this is the first reportedly molecular detection of m. ovis infection in goats from south america.  the present study was designed to investigate the possibility that the goat oviduct produces specific substance(s) similar to the oviductal glycoprotein (bogp) of the bovine oviduct.  in conclusion, m. ovis is highly prevalent in goats from northeastern brazil, mainly in dairy animals.  however, in the developed world (eg, the european union and much of north america), the value of goats relates to its select ability to produce high yields of milk and the increased returns associated with the dairy products, particularly artisanal cheeses.  goats also differ from other ruminants by their enhanced ability to feed-sort, but as with cows they can suffer from acidosis.  the commonly used description of the goat as the ""cow of the poorest"" underlines its importance for small farmers.  in so doing we shall reveal the adaptive capacity of goats to harsh environments.  in relation to host-specific parasites, such as eimeria spp., goats cannot be considered as a source for sheep, but competition for food and spaces between both small ungulates can suppose a reduced grazing area to sheep, provoking high environmental contamination and stress that facilitate their infection.  goat contact was a risk factor for sheep to be infected by protostrongylids, dictyocaulus filaria, gastrointestinal nematodes and eimeria spp. ||| ",no
Does thyroid hormone affect cardiac remodeling ?,"thyroid hormones have a significant impact on cardiac function and structure.  thyroid hormone exerts broad effects on the adult heart, but little is known regarding the role of thyroid hormone in the regulation of cardiac growth early in development and in response to pathophysiological conditions.  thyroid hormone plays an important role on myocardial development and function.  the purpose of this paper is to study the effect of hypothyroidism and thyroid replacement therapy on cardiac alterations.  thyroid hormones influence cardiac performance directly and indirectly via changes in peripheral circulation.  however, the influence of thyroid hormones on cardiac remodeling has not been thoroughly investigated at the molecular and cellular levels.  recent research has revealed novel actions of thyroid hormone (th) on the heart which may be of important physiological and therapeutic relevance.  thyroid hormone acts on the heart and peripheral vasculature in multiple ways.  thyroid hormones (ths) play a pivotal role in cardiac homeostasis.  excessive production of thyroid hormone results in an increased cardiac output as well as increased cardiac work efficiency, but reduced cardiac reserve.  heart dysfunctions have been shown to be associated with altered concentrations of thyroid hormones.  triiodothyronine (t3) has many effects on the heart, and marked changes in cardiac function and structure occur in patients with (subclinical) thyroid disease.  thyroid hormone has important cardiovascular effects, and abnormalities of its production cause cardiovascular morbidity.  thyroid hormone acts through genomic and non-genomic mechanisms to regulate cardiac function.  the role of both excessive and insufficient thyroid hormone production in the pathogenesis of clinical cardiac diseases can be deduced from thyroid hormone-induced molecular changes.  changes in the th-thyroid hormone receptor axis are also evident in patients with heart failure and associated with impaired cardiac function and increased mortality.  changes in thyroid status are associated with profound alterations in biochemical and physiological functioning of cardiac muscle, although its impact on cardiac energy metabolism is still debated.  we have demonstrated a strong positive association between thyroid hormone levels within the euthyroid range and heart rate, and more subtle effects on cardiac function and structure.  we investigated whether between-subject variation in thyroid hormone levels within the euthyroid range is also associated with heart rate and echocardiographic heart function and structure.  these findings suggest that in the late-gestation fetal heart, thyroid hormone has important cellular growth functions in both physiological and pathophysiological states. ||| ",yes

Does thyroid hormone regulate calcium transient in the myocardium?,"we conclude that (1) thyroid hormone increases neither the o2-consumption rate nor the level of i of resting cardiomyocytes and (2) the effects of the beta-receptor-agonist isoproterenol on ca2+ transients of electrically stimulated myocytes, are inversely related to the documented changes in beta-receptor density in heart tissue occurring with alterations in the thyroid state.  mechanisms underlying thyroid hormone-induced changes in myocardial contractile state were investigated by studying the effects of triiodothyronine (t3) on ca2+ fluxes across the sarcolemmal membrane and ca2+ handling by the sarcoplasmic reticulum, using spontaneously contracting monolayers of cultured chick embryo ventricular cells.  our results provide the first evidence that changes in cardiac contractility associated with altered thyroid state not only involve effects on ca2+, but may also involve changes in the response of the myofilaments to cai2+mediated by altered phi and nai+.  thyroid hormone (th) receptors are present in the myocardium and vascular tissue, and minor alterations in th concentration can affect cardiovascular (cv) physiology.  the cardiac transient outward current i(to) is regulated by thyroid hormone (t3).  these results indicate that the status of sarcolemmal ca(2+)-transport processes is regulated by thyroid hormones and the modification of ca(2+)-fluxes across the sarcolemmal membrane may play a crucial role in the development of thyroid state-dependent contractile changes in the heart.  thyroid-related hormones regulate the efficiency and expression of sarco-endoplasmic reticulum calcium atpases in cardiac and skeletal muscle.  in order to examine the regulatory role of thyroid hormone on sarcolemmal ca(2+)-channels, na(+)-ca2+ exchange and ca(2+)-pump as well as heart function, the effects of hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism on rat heart performance and sarcolemmal ca(2+)-handling were studied.  what is the consequence of hyperthyroidism for mitochondrial metabolism and ca(2+) handling of the postischaemic stunned heart?  it has been previously shown that modification of thyroid hormone levels have a profound impact on cardiac function, predominantly through a direct regulation of the sarcoplasmic reticulum protein levels.  the purpose of this study was to determine whether the cardiac contractile abnormalities induced by hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism are caused by changes in intracellular ca2+ handling or by alterations in the distribution of isoenzymes of ventricular myosin.  it is tempting to speculate that thyroid hormones also alter calcium concentration and thus influence the process of excitation-contraction coupling in the skeletal muscle.  we have tested the hypothesis that thyroid state may influence both the flow of cellular ca2+ and the myofilament response to ca2+ by effects on intracellular ph (phi) and na+ (nai+).  thyroid hormone has been shown to modulate the gene expression of cardiac potassium channels, however, it is not known if gene expression is different between the atrium and the ventricle.  these findings indicate that (1) thyroid hormones induce similar changes in the cardiac sr ca2+-atpase levels in either the presence or absence of phospholamban, (2) the thyroxine-induced increases in sr ca2+-atpase levels are not associated with any further stimulation of the hyperdynamic cardiac function in phospholamban-deficient mice, and (3) the decreased contractile parameters in hypothyroid phospholamban-deficient hearts associated with decreases in sr ca2+-atpase levels and myosin heavy chain isoform switches are at least as high as those of the stimulated hyperthyroid wild-type hearts.  hyperthyroidism is a cardiac risk factor, but thyroid therapy is used on myocardial stunning.  alterations in intracellular ca2+ handling alone may account for the contractile changes induced by hypothyroidism.  the effect of thyroid hormone (l-tri-iodothyronine; t3) on the cytosolic free ca2+ concentration (i) in l6 myotubes was studied at rest and during activation to explore the possible mediating role of i in the t3-induced net synthesis of fast-type sarcoplasmic reticulum (sr) ca(2+)-atpase.  we therefore investigated the effects of t3 on intracellular calcium transients and contractile performance in isolated ventricular rat myocytes.  studies with isolated-perfused hearts showed that while hypothyroidism did not modulate the inotropic response to extracellular ca2+ and ca2+ channel blocker verapamil, hyperthyroidism increased sensitivity to ca2+ and decreased sensitivity to verapamil in comparison to euthyroid hearts. ||| ",yes
Does thyroid hormone signaling affect microRNAs expression in the heart?,"the heart is an important target of thyroid hormone actions.  thyroid hormone (th) signalling is critical for heart function.  thyroid hormone regulates cardiac metabolism through multiple mechanisms.  thyroid hormones influence cardiac performance directly and indirectly via changes in peripheral circulation.  thirty-nine micrornas were differentially expressed in ht (fold change ≥2, p < 0.05) and mir-142-5p, mir-142-3p, and mir-146a were only high expression in ht thyroid gland (p < 0.001).  recent research has revealed novel actions of thyroid hormone (th) on the heart which may be of important physiological and therapeutic relevance.  thyroid hormone acts on the heart and peripheral vasculature in multiple ways.  similarities between the changes in cardiac gene expression in pathological hypertrophy leading to heart failure and hypothyroidism prompted scientists to suggest a role for thyroid hormone status in the development of metabolic and functional alterations in this disease.  changes in the th-thyroid hormone receptor axis are also evident in patients with heart failure and associated with impaired cardiac function and increased mortality.  we used an oligonucleotide microarray to identify novel cardiac genes regulated by t(3) and two thyroid hormone analogs, 3,5-diidodothyropropionic acid (ditpa) and cgs 23425 -oxamic acid].  heart function and its susceptibility to arrhythmias are modulated by thyroid hormones (ths) but the responsiveness of hypertensive individuals to thyroid dysfunction is elusive.  the heart expresses thyroid hormone receptors (thrs); thrα1 and thrβ1.  these findings suggest that in the late-gestation fetal heart, thyroid hormone has important cellular growth functions in both physiological and pathophysiological states.  thyroid hormone exerts broad effects on the adult heart, but little is known regarding the role of thyroid hormone in the regulation of cardiac growth early in development and in response to pathophysiological conditions.  this review will explore these newly identified modes of thyroid action on metabolism in heart.  thyroid hormone has been shown to modulate the gene expression of cardiac potassium channels, however, it is not known if gene expression is different between the atrium and the ventricle.  cardiac function and rna expression were studied after hypo-or hyperthyroidism inductions.  recent studies have established metabolic pathways in heart that rapidly respond to thyroid hormone.  thrβ has important role in the regulation of specific mrna and mirna in t3-induced cardiac hypertrophic growth and in the alteration of heart functions.  this study examined whether thyroid hormone modulates signaling via the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (camp) pathway by regulating cardiac adenylyl cyclase (ac) isoform expression. ||| ",yes
Does triiodothyronine (T3) has cardiac angiogenic effects?,"the direct cardiac effect occurs through triiodothyronine (t3)-mediated synthesis of specific proteins.  recent studies have suggested that acute administration of 3, 5, 3' triiodo-l-thyronine (t3) may increase ventricular performance; however, the direct cellular effects of acute t3 administration are not understood.  3,3',5-triiodo-l-thyronine (t3), a biologically active form of thyroid hormone, increases cardiac contractility.  3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (t(3)), the active form of th, induces the activation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase via pi3k/akt non-genomic signaling.  administration of 3,5,3'-triiodo-l-thyronine (t3) has recently been suggested to acutely improve left ventricular performance.  thus, we investigated the effects of triiodothyronine (t3) on reperfusion injury in a langendorff-perfused rat heart model of 30 min zero-flow ischaemia and 60 min of (r) with or without t3 (40 microg/l) at r, t3-r60, n = 11 and cnt-r60, n = 10, respectively.  t3 causes arterial relaxation and reduction of systemic vascular resistance, resulting in an increase in cardiac output.  t3 gave rise to a dose-dependent increase in cardiac performance within a certain dose range.  more recent studies have suggested that t3 may increase cardiac performance acutely, independent of protein neosynthesis.  3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (t3) is essential for the growth and the regulation of metabolic functions, moreover, the growth-stimulatory effect of t3 has largely been demonstrated and the pathways via which t3 promotes cell growth have been recently investigated.  the aim of this study was to determine whether 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (t3) can promote the proliferation of epicardial progenitor cells (epcs) and to investigate the potential underlying mechanism.  triiodothyronine regulates cardiac contractility; however, the mechanisms by which it produces its acute contractile effects remains unknown.  we evaluated its effect vs triiodothyronine (t3), on glucose-induced insulin secretion in ins-1e cells, a rat insulinoma line, and on human islets.  while triiodothyronine (t3) is usually considered to be the active form of thyroid hormone, one form of diiodothyronine (3,5-t2) exerts t3-like effects on energy consumption and lipid metabolism.  t3 reduced calcium response of vascular smooth muscle cells to ang ii by 26%.  we compared the acute effects of thyroid hormones (triiodothyronine  and thyroxine ) and of isoproterenol on the contractility of isolated rat hearts.  thus, acute t3 administration may provide a novel modality to improve left ventricular contractile function independent of the beta-adrenergic receptor system.  3,3',5-triiodo-l-thyronine (t3) improves hepatic lipid accumulation by increasing lipid catabolism but it also increases lipogenesis, which at first glance appears contradictory.  further studies are needed to identify the mechanisms underlying the acute contractile effects of t3 and to determine whether t3 will prove useful for increasing ventricular function in patients.  thus, t3 acutely stimulates cardiac contraction by mechanisms that differ from those of the more commonly used beta-adrenergic receptor agonists and phosphodiesterase inhibitors. ||| ",yes
Does triiodothyronine play a regulatory role in insulin secretion from pancreas?,"we evaluated its effect vs triiodothyronine (t3), on glucose-induced insulin secretion in ins-1e cells, a rat insulinoma line, and on human islets.  oral triiodothyronine is known to induce hypertension in laboratory rats, while triiodothyronine also increases the expression of genes encoding for enzymes involved in the synthesis and secretion of insulin by pancreatic beta cells.  the aim of our present study was to analyze how glucose and insulin affect trh secretion by the pancreatic islets.  triiodothyronine induced hyperthyroidism caused significantly elevated basal and stimulated glucose and insulin levels in rats.  l-triiodothyronine (l-t3) treatment as well as propylthiouracil (ptu) treatment decreased the immediate insulin secretory response of the pancreas slightly.  our hypothesis of free serum triiodothyronine as an intermediate factor in the insulin resistance syndrome is refuted by these data, but we identified free serum triiodothyronine concentrations as a new determinant of blood pressure, insulin production, and fasting insulin in healthy euthyroid subjects.  inhibition of glucose-induced insulin secretion from the pancreas is therefore a specific effect of thyroid hormones.  free serum triiodothyronine concentrations correlated, independent of age and gender, positively with systolic and diastolic blood pressure, insulin production and fasting insulin.  the objective of the present study was to assess the direct effect of 3,3',5-triiodothyronine (t3) on glucose transport and on the translocation of insulin-regulatable glucose transporter (glut4) in insulin-stimulated rat adipocytes.  the correlations of free serum triiodothyronine with blood pressure, insulin production and fasting insulin were independent of the waist:hip ratio and insulin sensitivity.  overall obesity is associated with elevated serum triiodothyronine concentrations and insulin resistance.  thyrotropin-releasing hormone (trh), originally isolated as a hypothalamic hormone, has been reported to be present and released from the pancreatic beta cells, affecting pancreatic functions.  thyrotropin-releasing hormone (trh), originally identified as a hypothalamic hormone, is expressed in the pancreas.  when changes in body weight, rectal temperature, plasma glucose, plasma cholesterol, and plasma butanol-extractable iodine (bei) in these rats were compared with the insulin secretory responses, it was evident that experimental hyperthyroidism results in decreased insulin release, whereas experimental hypothyroidism induces increased insulin secretion from the pancreas.  we investigated the hypothesis that central obesity and insulin resistance are linked with an increased blood pressure and insulin production through elevated free serum triiodothyronine concentrations.  hyperthyroidism, which was induced by administration of tri-iodothyronine (t3) to rats for 2, 5 or 10 days, increased fasting plasma concentrations of glucose, insulin and free fatty acids.  the influence of thyroid function on the kinetics of glucose-induced insulin secretion from the isolated perfused rat pancreas has been studied.  our present data showing that glucose stimulates and insulin inhibits pancreatic trh release are compatible with the possibility that this substance may play a role in glucoregulation.  this is the first description indicating the presence of functional trh receptor subtype 1 in the pancreatic beta cells, and our observations suggested the regulation of pancreatic function by trh through autocrine or paracrine mechanisms.  in conclusion, t2 and t3 have a direct regulatory role in insulin secretion, depending on their concentrations and the glucose level itself. ||| ",yes
Does triiodothyronine stimulate red blood cell sodium potassium pump?,"triiodothyronine pretreatment enhanced beta-adrenergic responses in both the control and the stunned myocytes.  tsh (seems to) affects the human erythrocytes na(+)/k(+)-atpase in vitro, however receptors on erythrocytes have not yet been described.  to investigate whether triiodothyronine pretreatment enhanced beta-adrenergic responses in stunned myocardium and whether this acute effect of triiodothyronine was mediated through the cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (amp) system.  to assess the possible role of the na+ pump in mediating physiological responses to thyroid hormone in the rat myocardium, we examined the effects of l-3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (t3) on the activities of the closely associated enzymes, na+-k+-dependent adenosine triphosphatase (na-k-atpase) and k+-dependent p-nitrophenyl phosphatase (k-dep-pnppase).  the possibility that augmentation of cardiac na+-k+-dependent adenosine triphosphatase (na-k-atpase) by l-3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (t3) was mediated by early changes in intracellular ion concentrations (1, 1) was explored by time-course analysis after a single injection of t3 in thyroid-ablated (131i) rats.  injection of t3 of the hypothyroid rat, however, significantly increased the vmax's for atp, na+, and k+ of ventricular microsomal na-k-atpase.  the purpose of this study was to determine whether triiodothyronine (t3) regulates the level of the messenger rna (mrna) coding for na,k-atpase alpha- and beta-subunits in the heart.  in conclusion the tsh action on na(+)/k(+)-atpase of human erythrocytes can be explained by the presence of tshr.  triiodothyronine (5 minutes) alone significantly increased the percent shortening in the control (from 3.75 +/- 0.36 to 4.34 +/- 0.45) and in the stunned myocytes (from 2.91 +/- 0.2 to 3.85 +/- 0.26).  after triiodothyronine pretreatment, isoproterenol caused a small increase in the cyclic amp level in the control but not in the stunned myocytes.  triiodothyronine (10 nmol/l) and/or isoproterenol (0.1 nmol/l) was added to the myocytes.  hypothyroid rats administered triiodothyronine (10 migrogram b.i.d.)  triiodothyronine pretreatment did not cause any change in cyclic amp levels in the control (2.50 +/- 0.29) or in the stunned myocytes (2.60 +/- 0.40).  however, this acute positive inotropic effect of triiodothyronine might not be mediated through the cyclic amp system.  thyroid hormone 3,3',5-triiodothyronine (t3) is an important regulator of na(+)-k(+)-adenosinetriphosphatase (na(+)-k(+)-atpase) activity in a variety of mammalian target tissues.  3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (t3) has a stimulatory effect on cellular growth via thyroid hormone receptors (trs) in several cell lines.  treatment of euthyroid rats with 3,5,3'-triiodo-1-thyronine increased na-k-atpase activity, sodium-dependent oxygen consumption (qo2), and para-aminohippurate (pah) accumulation by kidney slices without changing glomerular filtration rate or net sodium reabsorption by the intact kidney.  synthesis and activity of the enzymatic equivalent of the sodium pump, na,k-atpase, are regulated by thyroid hormone in responsive tissues.  after triiodothyronine pretreatment for 5 minutes, isoproterenol caused greater increases in the percent shortening in both the control (37%) and the stunned myocytes (62%) than either agent alone.  administration of t3 to hypothyroid rats had no effect on the transition temperature or the activation energy of ventricular microsomal na-k-atpase, as analyzed by an arrhenius plot. ||| ",no
Does ventriculoperitoneal shunt improve normal pressure hydrocephalus?,"a ventriculoperitoneal shunt (vps) is the most common treatment for hydrocephalus.  ventriculoperitoneal (vp) shunting is the gold standard treatment for hydrocephalus despite its high rate of complications, including catheter obstruction and infection.  ventriculoperitoneal shunt (vps) is the most common treatment for idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus, a subtype of hydrocephalus characterized by gait disturbance, dementia, and urinary incontinence.  placement of a ventriculoperitoneal (vp) shunt is the treatment of choice for communicating hydrocephalus; however, the extent to which vp shunting is able to relieve symptoms in patients who had previously been treated with cerebrospinal fluid diverting therapy at an outside institution remains unclear.  evaluate long-term changes in cognition after ventriculoperitoneal shunt insertion in patients with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus.  although studies have indicated that treatment of normal pressure hydrocephalus with ventriculoperitoneal shunt improves gait, effects of treatment on cognition have been inconsistent.  this was a prospective, longitudinal study of performance on neuropsychological tests before and 6 to 12 months after insertion of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt in 10 patients with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus who showed improvement in at least 1 clinical symptom with temporary lumbar drainage.  treatment of hydrocephalus is accomplished primarily through a ventricular-peritoneal shunt (vps).  ventriculoperitoneal (vp) shunt insertion is the most common cerebrospinal fluid (csf) diversionary procedure used for the treatment of chronic hydrocephalus.  a retrospective review of patients with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus treated with vp shunts at a single institution between 1993 and 2013 was conducted.  patients with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus who show clinical improvement (in any symptom) after lumbar drainage are likely to show significant long-term improvement in memory after ventriculoperitoneal shunt.  objective idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (inph) is treated with cerebrospinal fluid shunting, and implantation of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt (vps) is the current standard treatment.  the most prevalent treatment for managing hydrocephalus is to implant a ventriculoperitoneal shunt, which diverts excess csf out of the brain.  the current regular treatment for hydrocephalus is cerebrospinal fluid shunting, which is frequently related to failure and complications.  ventriculoperitoneal (vp) shunt placement often yields significant clinical improvements, sometimes without apparent reduction of ventricular size.  this study aims to describe the application of retrograde ventricle-sinus shunt (rvss) in patients with hydrocephalus after surgical treatment of myelomeningocele.  full-mouth rehabilitation of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt-treated hydrocephalic pediatric patient: a case report.  rvss shunt is viable; it is an alternative option for the treatment of hydrocephalus.  although most patients with hydrocephalus are treated effectively with ventriculoperitoneal shunts, a small group fails to respond to diversion procedures.  the symptoms of nph may be relieved by surgically implanting a ventriculoperitoneal shunt to drain excess cerebrospinal fluid. ||| ",yes
Does verubecestat activate BACE?,"after adjustment for other risk factors, vbe was not predictive of recurrent stroke (hazard ratio , 1.3; 95% confidence interval , .85-1.9) or major hemorrhage (hr, 1.5; ci, .94-2.6), but was of death (hr, 1.7; ci, 1.1-2.7).  the clinical implications of vertebrobasilar ectasia (vbe) in patients with cerebral small-artery disease are not well defined.  vbe was defined a priori as basilar artery greater than 4.5 mm and/or vertebral artery greater than 4.0 mm.  subjects were classified as vbe-negative or vbe-positive, who were further classified based on the presence of vad with magnetic resonance angiography.  we investigated whether vbe is associated with recurrent stroke, major hemorrhage, and death in a large cohort of patients with recent lacunar stroke.  there was a significant difference in the risk of posterior circulation ischemic stroke between the vbe-positive group and the vbe-negative group (p = 0.002).  virginiae butanolides (vbs) a-e are butyrolactone autoregulators that control virginiamycin production in streptomyces virginiae.  virginiae butanolides (vbs), which are among the butyrolactone autoregulators of streptomyces species, act as a primary signal in streptomyces virginiae to trigger virginiamycin biosynthesis and possess a specific binding protein, bara.  virginiae butanolide (vb) is a gamma-butyrolactone autoregulator that triggers production of the streptogramin antibiotic virginiamycin in streptomyces virginiae.  patient characteristics and risks of stroke recurrence and mortality during follow-up (median, 3.5 years) were compared between patients with and without vbe.  virginiae butanolide (vb) is a member of the gamma-butyrolactone autoregulators and triggers the production of streptogramin antibiotics virginiamycin m1 and s in streptomyces virginiae.  background and purpose: although vertebrobasilar ectasia (vbe) is diagnosed with increasing frequency, it is not clear whether this is because of altered hemodynamics caused by the effects of matrix metalloproteinases (mmps) and/or vertebral artery dominance (vad).  virginiae butanolides (vbs) are autoregulators of streptomyces virginiae, which induce virginiamycin biosynthesis.  virginiae butanolide c (vb-c) is an autoregulator which triggers virginiamycin production in streptomyces virginiae.  baseline systolic blood pressure was inversely associated with vbe.  bara of streptomyces virginiae is a specific receptor protein for virginiae butanolide (vb), one of the gamma-butyrolactone autoregulators of the streptomyces species, and acts as a transcriptional regulator controlling both virginiamycin production and vb biosynthesis.  that is, although vbs are needed to induce virginiamycin m and s synthesis, the amount of vb-c added should be such that as small an amount as possible of vbs is synthesized to achieve the maximum production of virginiamycins m and s. however, the vb-c addition earlier than 8 h from the start of culture showed no clear relationship between the amounts of vbs and virginiamycins m and s produced.  a bars2-disruptant (strain ic152), created by means of homologous recombination, showed no differences in growth in liquid medium or morphology on solid medium compared to a wild-type strain, suggesting that bars2 does not play any role in primary metabolism or morphological differentiation of s. virginiae.  northern blot analysis indicated that the bicistronic transcript of barb-vars appeared 1 to 2 h before the onset of virginiamycin m1 and s production, at which time vb was produced, while exogenously added virginiamycin s apparently induced the monocistronic vars transcript.  addition of chemically synthesized virginiae butanolide-c (vb-c), which is one of the vbs, can also control the induction time and the amount of virginiamycin production. ||| ",no
"Does wheat belongs to the genus Avena, yes or no?","), one of the four cultivated species of the genus avena, could be considered as another alternative crop.  phylogenomic analyses, based on the complete plastome sequences and the lsc intermolecular recombination sequences, support the monophyly of avena with two clades in the genus.  seven wheat cultivars and one wild subspecies triticum aestivum ssp.  investigation on the mechanisms how h. avenae perceives wheat roots is limited.  aegilops caudata l. is an annual wild relative of wheat distributed over the northeastern mediterranean basin.  heterodera avenae, as an obligate endoparasite, causes severe yield loss in wheat (triticum aestivum).  variabilis chromosome carrying stripe rust resistance in the background of wheat lines developed from crosses of the stripe rust susceptible bread wheat cultivar yiyuan 2 with a resistant ae.  oat (avena sativa l.) is a recognized health-food, and the contributions of its different candidate a-genome progenitor species remain inconclusive.  here, we report chloroplast genome sequences of eleven avena species, to examine the plastome evolutionary dynamics and analyze phylogenetic relationships between oat and its congeneric wild related species.  our study enhances the recognition to the orientation mechanism of h. avenae towards wheat roots.  in the present study, quantitative trait locus (qtl) analysis for aba responsiveness at the seedling stage was performed using recombinant inbred lines derived from a cross between common wheat cultivars showing different aba responsiveness.  aegilops variabilis (uusvsv), an important sources for wheat improvement, originated from chromosome doubling of a natural hybrid between ae.  diversification of avena plastomes is explained by the presence of highly diverse genes and intergenic regions, lsc intermolecular recombination, and the co-occurrence of tandem repeat and indels or single nucleotide polymorphisms.  allohexaploid wild oat, avena fatua l. (poaceae; 2n = 6x = 42), is one of the world's worst weeds, yet unlike some of the other avena hexaploids, its genomic structure has been relatively little researched.  however, the relationship between gene expression and responsiveness to aba at the seedling stage has not been well studied in wheat.  wheat (triticum aestivum l.) is an important crop and requires long day and short night to flower.  aegilops tauschii, the wild progenitor of wheat d-genome and a valuable germplasm for wheat improvement, has a wide natural distribution from eastern turkey to china.  morpho-physiological adaptation and the adaptation to drought of these different ploidy wheat species is largely unknown.  oat (avena sativa l.), a hexaploid crop with unknown genome, has valuable nutritional, medicinal and pharmaceutical uses.  winter wheat (triticum aestivum l.) is used as fresh green winter forage worldwide, and its ability to regenerate after mowing determines whether it can be used for forage production; however, the molecular mechanism of regeneration is poorly understood. ||| ",no
Does ziconotide bind to N-type calcium channels?,"ziconotide is a novel peptide that blocks the entry of calcium into neuronal n-type voltage-sensitive calcium channels, preventing the conduction of nerve signals.  ziconotide, an intrathecal analgesic for the management of chronic intractable pain, binds with high affinity to n-type calcium channels in neuronal tissue and obstructs neurotransmission.  ziconotide's therapeutic benefit derives from its potent and selective blockade of neuronal-type voltage-sensitive calcium channels.  ziconotide is a selective peptide antagonist of the n-type calcium channel currently in clinical trials for analgesia.  ziconotide is a powerful analgesic drug that has a unique mechanism of action involving potent and selective block of n-type calcium channels, which control neurotransmission at many synapses.  ziconotide is an n-type calcium channel antagonist to treat chronic pain that is delivered intrathecally.  ziconotide, a synthetic peptide analogue of the ω-conotoxin mviia that blocks selectively n-type voltage-sensitive calcium channels, has been used in intrathecal administration for 30 years.  while antiepileptic activities of other types of calcium channel blockers (t- or l-type) are well established, there is no information regarding the effect of ziconotide as an n-type calcium channel antagonist in pentylenetetrazol-induced seizures or its anxiolytic and sedative activities.  ziconotide, formerly known also as snx- 111, represents a new class of agents, the n-type calcium channel blockers.  ziconotide, the synthetic form of cone snail peptide pi-conotoxin mviia, is a neurone-specific n-type calcium channel blocker with an analgesic and neuroprotective effect.  ziconotide (formerly snx-111) selectively blocks n-type voltage-sensitive calcium channels and may be effective in patients with pain that is refractory to opioid therapy or those with intolerable opioid-related adverse effects.  ziconotide (prialt(®)) is a synthetic conopeptide analgesic that acts by selectively antagonizing n-type voltage-gated calcium channels.  ziconotide (snx-111), a selective blocker of neuronal n-type voltage-sensitive calcium channels, is antinociceptive when it is administered intrathecally.  the selective n-type calcium channel blocker ziconotide ameliorates severe chronic pain but has a narrow therapeutic window and requires intrathecal administration.  ziconotide (ω-conotoxin mviia peptide) is a novel analgesic agent acting on voltage-gated calcium channels and is administered intrathecally for neuropathic pain.  a selective n-type calcium channel inhibitor, ziconotide (prialt), is a neuroactive peptide recently marketed as a novel nonopioid treatment for severe chronic pain.  ziconotide, a state-independent peptide inhibitor of ca(v)2.2 channels, is efficacious in treating refractory pain but exhibits a narrow therapeutic window and must be administered intrathecally.  ziconotide is a synthetic peptide equivalent of an w-conotoxin, obtained from the marine snail conus magus, which acts by blocking n-type calcium channels in the spinal cord, reducing the perception of pain.  the present investigation was designed to assess the safety and analgesic efficacy of ziconotide, a new n-type calcium channel blocker, when administered intrathecally to patients with acute postoperative pain.  n-type calcium channels represent a promising target for the treatment of neuropathic pain. ||| ",yes
"Down's syndrome occurs when an individual has an extra copy or part of a copy of chromosome 21, yes or no?","an extra copy of chromosome 21, a small chromosome or a specific segment of it, is the cause of the disorder known as down's syndrome (ds).  down syndrome (ds) is caused in most cases by the presence of an extra chromosome 21.  down syndrome (ds) is the most common human chromosomal abnormality caused by an extra copy of chromosome 21.  down syndrome (ds), commonly caused by an extra copy of chromosome 21 (chr21), occurs in approximately one out of 700 live births.  down syndrome, the most frequent genetic disorder, is characterized by an extra copy of all or part of chromosome 21.  down syndrome is caused by an extra copy of human chromosome 21 and the resultant dosage-related overexpression of genes contained within it.  chromosome 21, the smallest human chromosome, has been the subject of intense study because it is the chromosome which, when present in an extra copy, leads to down syndrome.  down syndrome (ds) is the most common form of intellectual disability associated with central nervous system abnormalities and results from an extra complete or partial copy of human chromosome 21.  down syndrome (ds) is the most common human chromosomal abnormality caused by an extra copy of chromosome 21 and characterized by somatic anomalies and mental retardation.  the presence of an extra copy of human chromosome 21 (trisomy 21), especially region 21q22.2, causes many phenotypes in down syndrome, including mental retardation.  an extra copy of chromosome 21 causes down syndrome, the most frequent genetic cause of significant mental retardation, which affects up to 1 in 700 live births.  down syndrome (ds) is the most common human chromosomal abnormality caused by an extra copy of chromosome 21 and characterized clinically by somatic anomalies, mental retardation and precocious dementia.  down syndrome (ds) is the most common known aneuploidy, caused by an extra copy of all or part of chromosome 21.  in a previous case of a newborn infant with typical down syndrome, chromosome analysis indicated the presence of an unusual and complex translocation of chromosome 21.  down syndrome is rarely due to a de novo duplication of chromosome 21 .  trisomy 21 or down syndrome is the most common type of autosomal chromosome abnormality, with an incidence of one out of 700 live births.  the clinical, cytogenetic, and molecular studies of an individual are presented here for the purpose of further characterizing what regions of chromosome 21q are essential for expression of the typical down syndrome phenotype.  trisomy 21 (down's syndrome, ds) is the most frequent chromosomal aberration.  although an extra chromosome 21 is the genetic cause for ds, specific phenotypic features may result from the duplication of smaller regions of the chromosome and more studies need to define genotypic and phenotypic correlations.  we report on a 26 year old male with partial trisomy 21 presenting mild clinical symptoms relative to ds including borderline intellectual disability. ||| ",yes
"Has ""RNA interference"" been awarded Nobel prize?","since the first unequivocal description of rna interference (rnai) in 1998, it has remained one of the hottest topics under investigation, culminating in the award of a nobel prize to its discoverers in 2006.  the discovery of rna interference (rnai) earned the 2006 nobel prize in physiology or medicine for its biological significance and potential for developing novel therapeutics.  the nobel prize in medicine and physiology was awarded to the rna interference (rnai) field in 2006 because of the huge therapeutic potential this technique harbours.  rna interference (rnai) is a natural process of posttranscriptional gene regulation that has raised a lot of attention culminating with the nobel prize in medicine in 2006.  in 2006, the discovery of rnai was awarded the nobel prize in medicine and its success has accumulated since.  the new antimicrobials received nobel prizes until 1960; however no treatment study was awarded the prize until the discovery of artemisinin and ivermectin, for which the nobel prize was awarded in 2015.  retrospective analysis of the nobel awards since 1901.  rna interference (rnai) is a natural process through which double-stranded rna molecules can silence the gene carrying the same code as the particular rna of interest.  although the scientists who proved the hypothesis (fridjof nansen, wilhelm his, and august forel) were never awarded by the nobel committee, their studies gave rise to one of the most fundamental questions in 20th century neuroscience: how is information carried from one neuron to another or to an effector cell?  nobel prizes are prestigious world awards attributed for intellectual achievements.  the aim of this paper is to deliver a perspective on future nobel prizes by reviewing the features of nobel prizes awarded in the infectious diseases-related (idr) field over the last 115 years.  in the modern era of multidisciplinary, multiple-team endeavors, are the nobel prizes outdated?  the nobel prize is the world's foremost honor for scientific advances in medicine and other areas.  since its inception in 1901, many renowned scientists have received this award.  no other prize in science matches the iconic stature of the nobels.  here we review the effect of the nobel prize and acknowledge that it has had many beneficial effects on science.  the nobel prize is arguably the best known and most prestigious award in science.  founded by alfred nobel, the prizes have been awarded annually since 1901.  the purpose of this paper was to determine if quantitative rankings of highly cited research authors confirm nobel prize awards.  this review does not include 21st century laureates, although the prize has already been given to neuroscientists twice this century; arvid carlsson, paul greengard, and eric kandel received the award in 2000 for their discoveries related to signal transduction, and richard axel and linda buck received the award in 2004 for their work in the field of odorant receptors and the organization of the olfactory system. ||| ",yes
Has ATF4 transcription factor been linked to cancer and neoplastic transformation?,"it is well known that activating transcription factor 4 (atf4) expression is closely associated with progression of many cancers.  it has been reported that activating transcription factor 4 (atf4) increases the processes of tumor growth, metastasis and drug resistance.  here, we report that atf4 promotes oncogene-induced neoplastic transformation by suppressing the expression of cellular senescence-associated genes.  overexpression of atf4 in a549 cells significantly promoted cancer cell growth and invasion (p < 0.05).  elevated levels of atf4 were sufficient to suppress expression of these proteins and drive oncogenic transformation.  activating transcription factor 4 (atf4), an endoplasmic reticulum stress-inducible transcription factor, plays important roles in cancer progression and resistance to therapy.  in this study, we investigated the function of atf4 in non-small cell lung cancer and its molecular regulation.  activating transcription factor 4 (atf4) is a member of the camp response element binding (creb) protein family and has been reported to participate in cancer progression; however, its molecular mechanism is not fully understood.  activating transcription factor 2 (atf2), a member of the activator protein 1 (ap-1) transcription factor family, has been shown to be involved in the pathobiology of numerous cancers.  activating transcription factor 2 (atf2), a member of the activator protein 1 (ap-1) transcription factor family, has been shown to be involved in the pathobiology of numerous cancers.  it has been reported that the transcription factor activating enhancer-binding protein 4 (tfap4) is upregulated and associated with an aggressive phenotype in several cancers.  our findings define a central function for atf4 in promoting oncogenic transformation by suppressing a central pathway of cellular senescence.  we detected cytoplasmic and nuclear atf4 expression in lung cancer a549, h1299, and lk2 cells, and the total expression of atf4 was higher than that in hbe cells (p < 0.05).  many cancers overexpress atf4, a stress-induced transcription factor that promotes cell survival under hypoxic conditions and other stresses of the tumor microenvironment, but the potential contributions of atf4 to oncogenesis itself have been little explored.  t cell factor-4 (tcf-4) plays an important role in development and carcinogenesis.  activating transcription factor 2 (atf2) is a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, which has been shown to participate in the pathobiology of numerous cancers.  transcription factor activating enhancer binding protein 4 (tfap4) is an important regulator in the genesis and progression of human cancers.  recently, the role of tcf-4 has been described in colon cancer and other cancers.  increasing evidence suggests that tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 4 (traf4) is an oncogene which is frequently overexpressed in many human carcinomas.  tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 4 (traf4) is a gene whose expression is altered in cancers. ||| ",yes

Has Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency an X-linked inheritance?,"glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (g6pd) deficiency is an x-chromosome-linked hereditary disorder.  glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (g6pd) deficiency is one of the most common x-linked enzymopathies caused by g6pd gene variant.  glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency is an x-linked recessive hereditary disease characterised by abnormally low levels of g6pd.  glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (g6pd) deficiency is caused by one or more mutations in the g6pd gene on chromosome x.  glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (g(6)pd) deficiency is the most common x-linked defect of enzyme pathways in human.  glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (g6pd) deficiency is an x-linked incompletely dominant enzyme deficiency that results from g6pd gene mutations.  glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (g6pd, ec 1.1.1.49) deficiency is caused by one or more mutations in the g6pd gene on chromosome x.  deficiency of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (g6pd) is an x-linked hereditary genetic defect that is the most common polymorphism and enzymopathy in humans.  glucose-6-phosphate dehyrdgoenase (g6pd) deficiency is a common x-linked genetic trait, with an associated enzyme phenotype, whereby males are either g6pd deficient or normal, but females exhibit a broader range of g6pd deficiencies, ranging from severe deficiency to normal.  glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (d-g6pd) is an x-linked recessive disorder resulted from deleterious variants in the housekeeping gene glucose-6-phosphate 1-dehydrogenase (g6pd), causing impaired response to oxidizing agents.  glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (g6pd) gene is located at the x-chromosome at xq28 and the disease is recessively inherited predominantly in males.  g6pd deficiency is x-linked and thus subject to random x-chromosome inactivation in women giving them mosaic expression of g6pd activities in their individual cells.  glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase is a highly polymorphic enzyme encoded by a human x-linked gene (xq2.8).  the glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (g-6-pd) gene is located on the x-chromosome.  glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (g6pd) deficiency is the most common enzyme disorder in the world.  glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (g6pd) deficiency is the most common human enzyme defect.  multivariate logistic regression indicated that heterozygotes with hypermethylation of specific cpg sites in the g6pd promoter and preferential x-inactivation of the wild-type allele were at risk of enzyme deficiency.  overall prevalence for the x-linked g6pd a- mutation was; 79.59% wild type, 12.65% heterozygous and 7.76% homozygous or hemizygous.  molecular identification of the most prevalent mutations in g6pd gene was carried out in 71 males and females with g6pd deficiency.  g6pd deficiency is one of the most common mutations in humans and is known to cause health problems for hundreds of millions worldwide. ||| ",yes
Has IVIG been tested in clinical trials for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease?,"intravenous immunoglobulin (ivig) is currently in clinical study for alzheimer's disease (ad).  intravenous immunoglobulin (ivig) therapy has shown promise in the treatment of alzheimer's disease (ad).  intravenous immunoglobulin (ivig) has been proposed as a potential therapeutic for alzheimer's disease (ad) and its efficacy is currently being tested in mild-to-moderate ad.  intravenous immunoglobulin (ivig) treatment of alzheimer's disease (ad) has been encouraging.  intravenous immunoglobulin (ivig) has shown limited promise so far in human clinical studies on alzheimer's disease (ad), yet overwhelmingly positive preclinical work in animals and human brain cultures support the notion that the therapy remains potentially efficacious.  the human polyclonal igg antibody preparation known as intravenous immunoglobulin (ivig) has been under study as a potential treatment for alzheimer's disease (ad) since 2002.  preclinical and clinical studies have shown that ivig has anti-amyloid and immune modulatory properties relevant to treating neurodegenerative disorders.  intravenous immunoglobulin (ivig) preparations are being investigated as a potential agent for treatment or prevention of alzheimer's disease (ad).  intravenous immunoglobulin (ivig) has been proposed as a potential agent for alzheimer's disease (ad) immunotherapy because it contains antibodies against beta-amyloid (abeta).  intravenous immunoglobulin (ivig) products are being investigated as possible therapeutic agents for mild cognitive impairment and alzheimer's disease (ad).  intravenous immunoglobulin (ivig) has been a candidate as a potential anti-amyloid immunotherapy for alzheimer disease (ad) because it contains anti-amyloid β (aβ) antibodies.  recent phase ii and iii studies with intravenous immunoglobulin (ivig) in patients with alzheimer's disease (ad) did not find evidence for the slowing of ad progression compared to placebo-treated patients, in contrast to encouraging results in pilot studies.  to assess the efficacy and safety of intravenous immunoglobulin (ivig) for patients with alzheimer's disease (ad).  pilot studies suggest that ivig may stabilize cognitive functioning in patients with mild-to-moderate alzheimer's disease.  in early stage ad clinical trials, ivig was found to reduce cognitive decline and increase brain glucose metabolism.  the therapeutic effects of intravenous immunoglobulin (ivig) products were recently studied in alzheimer's disease (ad) patients.  the effects of intravenous immunoglobulin (ivig) products were recently examined in patients with alzheimer's disease (ad).  the effects of intravenous immunoglobulin (ivig) products are being evaluated in alzheimer's disease (ad) patients.  these observations led to clinical studies investigating the potential role of ivig as a therapeutic agent in ad.  intravenous immunoglobulin (ivig) contains anti-amyloid-β antibodies as well as antibodies providing immunomodulatory effects that may modify chronic inflammation in alzheimer's disease. ||| ",yes
Has Revlimid been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration?,"since its approval in 1997 by the fda (united states food and drug administration), rituximab has been used for certain b-cell lymphomas and treatment-resistant rheumatoid arthritis.  this report summarizes the u.s. food and drug administration (fda)'s approval of temsirolimus (torisel), on may 30, 2007, for the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma (rcc).  vilazodone was recently approved by the us food and drug administration (fda) for the treatment of major depressive disorder (mdd).  after public hearings in july 2010, and june 2011, the fda revoked this approved indication in november 2011, on the basis of additional evidence regarding its risk/benefit profile.  preliminary results were presented at the mountain states conference for residents and preceptors in may 2019 in salt lake city, ut, and at an encore presentation october 2019 at the american college of clinical pharmacy annual meeting in new york, ny.  rituximab is a top-selling biologic that was first approved by the fda in 1997 for a non-hodgkin lymphoma orphan indication.  when venlafaxine was introduced in 1994, it was the first of the newer generation antidepressants to be classified as a serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (snri).  we investigate why, despite internal negative opinions and an advisory committee's non-approval recommendation, the fda approved relenza in the late 1990s.  everolimus was recently approved by the food and drug administration for use in liver transplantation.  by law, the commissioner of the food and drug administration (fda) is responsible for determining whether a new drug is safe and efficacious before it is approved for marketing in the u.s. and for monitoring its use after approval.  an extended release (xr) formulation of venlafaxine, introduced in 1997, subsequently received regulatory approval for treatment of three anxiety disorders: generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder and panic disorder.  in february 2008, the us food and drug administration (fda) granted accelerated approval for bevacizumab for metastatic breast cancer.  the purpose of this review is to summarize the fda's approach to its review of the clinical pharmacology and the clinical efficacy and safety data for this new drug application, important issues in its decision-making, and its conclusions.  it has since been approved for additional orphan indications, with rheumatoid arthritis as the only fda-approved, nonorphan indication.  a major activity occupying the u.s. food and drug administration for several years has been a rewrite of the fda's ind and nda regulations which govern the clinical testing of investigational new drugs and the process for subsequent market approval for those drug entities.  the us food and drug administration (fda) is open to accepting real-world evidence (rwe) to support its assessment of medical products.  we conducted a systematic review of publicly available fda approval documents from january 2019 to june 2021.  the food and drug administration (fda) has determined the regulatory review period for therma choice5 uterine ballon therapy system and is publishing this notice of that determination as required by law.  multivariable logistic regression modeling was performed to assess factors associated with receiving rituximab for an fda-approved indication.  on october 6, 2006, the u.s. food and drug administration granted regular approval to vorinostat (zolinza(r); merck & co., inc., whitehouse station, nj), a histone deacetylase inhibitor, for the treatment of cutaneous manifestations of cutaneous t-cell lymphoma (ctcl) in patients with progressive, persistent, or recurrent disease on or following two systemic therapies. ||| ",yes
Has depression been shown to be a predictor of frailty?,"this study examines whether physical frailty predicts a higher incidence of depression, as well as a less favorable course of depression.  depressive symptoms are associated with frailty.  although frailty is a well-established risk factor for adverse health outcomes in later life, little is known about the role of physical frailty on the development of incident major depressive disorder (mdd).  in this paper, we aimed to investigate whether frailty and pre-frailty are associated with an increased risk of depression in a prospective cohort of community-dwelling older people.  therefore, we examined whether frailty and frailty-related biomarkers predict mortality among depressed older patients.  in late-life depression, frailty identifies older patients at increased risk of adverse negative health outcomes.  the purpose of this study was to determine whether frailty is an important and independent predictor of incident major depressive disorder (mdd) in elderly people without probable depression at baseline.  in our study of 378 older patients aged ≥ 60 years with a depressive disorder (dsm-iv criteria), we examined whether frailty predicts time-to-death during a 6-year follow-up using cox proportional hazard regression analyses adjusted for confounders.  frailty and pre-frailty are two common conditions in the older people, but whether these conditions could predict depression is still limited to a few longitudinal studies.  physical frailty predicted the onset of depressed mood with a hazard rate of 1.26 (95% confidence interval 1.09-1.45, p = .002).  because physical frailty predicts both the onset and course of late-life depressed mood, physical frailty should receive more attention in mental health care planning for older persons as well as its interference with treatment.  depressive symptoms were strongly associated with frailty, and there was a gradient effect across the entire range of the ces-d scale.  frailty and depressive symptoms are common issues facing older adults and may be associated.  to determine if: (i) depressive symptoms are associated with frailty; (ii) there is a gradient in this effect across the range of depressive symptoms; and (iii) the association between depressive symptoms and frailty is specific to particular types of depressive symptoms (positive affect, negative affect, somatic complaints, and interpersonal relations).  similar to frailty, late-life depression is also associated with increased mortality rates.  the present study supports a significant role of physical frailty as a predictor of incident mdd in older adults.  clinicians should consider assessing frail older adults for the presence of depression.  among older community dwellers, frailty and pre-frailty did not predict the onset of depression during 2 years of follow-up, when accounting for potential confounders, whilst slow gait speed considered alone may predict depression in the older people.  in a logistic regression analysis, adjusted for 18 potential baseline confounders, pre-frailty (odds ratio (or) = 0.89; 95% confidence interval (ci), 0.54-1.46; p = 0.64) and frailty (or = 1.22; 95% ci, 0.90-1.64; p = 0.21) did not predict the onset of depression at follow-up.  late-life depression and physical frailty are supposed to be reciprocally associated, however, longitudinal studies are lacking. ||| ",yes
Has field-programmable gate array (FPGA) technology been used to solve sequence alignment problems?,"this architecture exploits the reconfigurability of fpgas to allow the development of fast yet flexible alignment designs.  however, the recent progress of programmable hardware such as field programmable gate arrays (fpgas) provides a cost effective solution to this challenge.  in this paper, we present a runtime reconfigurable architecture for accelerating short read alignment using fpgas.  a design of systolic array-based field programmable gate array (fpga) parallel architecture for basic local alignment search tool (blast) algorithm is proposed.  with general-purpose computing systems struggling to address this challenge, specialized processors such as the field-programmable gate array (fpga) are receiving growing interest.  field-programmable gate arrays are widely considered as accelerators for compute-intensive applications.  a number of useful approaches to this problem have previously been developed, but often they are limited to only a subset of multiple-alignment applications and cannot easily deal with the complex structural organization seen in an increasing number of sequences.  application to rna and protein sequence alignment is also discussed.  fpgas contain millions of programmable logic gates to design massively parallel accelerators.  field-programmable gate arrays (fpgas) can potentially be configured as beamforming platforms for ultrasound imaging, but a long design time and skilled expertise in hardware programming are typically required.  the article shows that the backtracking procedure of the sequence alignment algorithms may be designed to fit in with the gpu architecture.  many recent advances in biology and medicine have resulted from dna sequence alignment algorithms and technology.  several case studies demonstrate the effectiveness of using these computing models in developing fpga applications for molecular modeling.  in many cases, the computation cores and data types are suited to field-programmable gate arrays.  protein sequence alignment is the task of identifying evolutionarily or structurally related positions in a collection of amino acid sequences.  programmable hardware, in particular field programmable gate arrays (fpgas), promises a significant increase in computational performance for simulations in geophysical fluid dynamics compared with cpus of similar power consumption.  here we present the msa-pad application, a dna multiple sequence alignment framework that uses pfam protein domain information to align dna sequences encoding either single or multiple protein domains.  we apply this architecture to develop an alignment design which supports exact and approximate alignment with up to two mismatches.  in this article we propose a fast optimal global sequence alignment algorithm, fogsaa, which aligns a pair of nucleotide/protein sequences faster than any optimal global alignment method including the widely used needleman-wunsch (nw) algorithm.  pairwise sequence alignment methods are widely used in biological research. ||| ",yes
Has intepirdine been evaluated in clinical trials?

Has overexpression of sirtuins been reported to increase lifespan in budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae)?,"overexpression of sirtuins (nad(+)-dependent protein deacetylases) has been reported to increase lifespan in budding yeast (saccharomyces cerevisiae), caenorhabditis elegans and drosophila melanogaster.  members of the sirtuin family including the founding protein sir2 in saccharomyces cerevisiae have been linked to lifespan extension in simple organisms.  sirtuin activating compounds (stacs) can promote the survival of human cells and extend the replicative lifespan of yeast.  our findings do not rule out a role for sirtuins in determination of metazoan lifespan, but they do cast doubt on the robustness of the previously reported effects of sirtuins on lifespan in c. elegans and drosophila.  here we re-examined the reported effects of sirtuin overexpression on ageing and found that standardization of genetic background and the use of appropriate controls abolished the apparent effects in both c. elegans and drosophila.  calorie restriction extends life span in organisms as diverse as yeast and mammals through incompletely understood mechanisms.the role of nad+-dependent deacetylases known as sirtuins in this process, particularly in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae, is controversial.  in the budding yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae, calorie restriction extends lifespan by increasing the activity of sir2 (ref.  these studies have demonstrated that genetic and pharmacologic manipulation of sirtuin activity have beneficial effects in a surprisingly broad spectrum of aging-associated conditions suggesting that the sir2-family of enzymes presents an attractive target for the development of pharmacological agents.  here we show that resveratrol and other stacs activate sirtuins from caenorhabditis elegans and drosophila melanogaster, and extend the lifespan of these animals without reducing fecundity.  here, we present an overview on the molecular mechanisms by which these interventions mediate lifespan extension in yeast.  in yeast, resveratrol mimics calorie restriction by stimulating sir2, increasing dna stability and extending lifespan by 70%.  the budding yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae has served as a premier model organism for identifying genetic and molecular factors that modulate cellular aging and is a powerful system in which to evaluate candidate longevity interventions.  while the initial model favored pharmacological activators of sirtuins as calorie restriction mimetics, it now appears that either activation or inhibition of sirtuins may be desirable for ameliorating disease depending on the pathological condition and the target tissue.  background: saccharomyces cerevisiae is a model organism with conserved aging pathways.  we measured chronological life span of wild-type and sir2δ strains over a higher glucose range than typically used for studying yeast calorie restriction.  included in this family are sir-2.1, a caenorhabditis elegans enzyme that regulates lifespan, and sirt1, a human deacetylase that promotes cell survival by negatively regulating the p53 tumour suppressor.  in the budding yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae this effect requires sir2 (ref.  like metazoans, yeast lifespan is extended by caloric restriction and treatment with pharmacological agents which extend lifespan.  the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae is successfully used as a model organism to find genes responsible for lifespan control of higher organisms.  in c. elegans, outcrossing of a line with high-level sir-2.1 overexpression abrogated the longevity increase, but did not abrogate sir-2.1 overexpression. ||| ",yes
Has protein citrullination been implicated in rheumatoid arthritis?,"the importance of citrullination in rheumatoid arthritis (ra) has been reported, but the degree to which individual citrullinated proteins affect the onset and progression of ra is still unclear.  anti-citrullinated protein antibodies have been detected with high specificity in serum of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (ra), and citrullination of proteins may play a key role in the pathogenesis of ra.  in the inflamed rheumatoid joint there is increased protein citrullination.  protein citrullination is a posttranslational modification that has attracted increased attention, especially for its involvement in rheumatoid arthritis (ra).  protein citrullination is present in the rheumatoid synovium, presumably contributing to the perpetuation of chronic inflammation, in the presence of specific autoimmunity.  the presence of autoantibodies and autoreactive t cells to citrullinated proteins and citrullinating enzymes in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (ra), together with the accumulation of citrullinated proteins in rheumatoid joints, provides substantial evidence that dysregulated citrullination is a hallmark feature of ra.  several proteins are citrullinated in rheumatoid arthritis, including collagen type ii, fibrinogen, and fibronectin.  anti-citrullinated protein antibodies have a diagnostic role in rheumatoid arthritis (ra); however, little is known about their origins and contribution to pathogenesis.  autoantibodies against citrullinated proteins are diagnostic for rheumatoid arthritis.  we explored the expression of citrullinated proteins in joints and sera of experimental arthritis, and we further investigated their specific expression correlated with the disease activity in patients with ra.  anticitrullinated protein antibodies (acpa) and citrullinated proteins play key roles in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (ra).  citrullination, the post-translational conversion of arginines to citrullines, may contribute to rheumatoid arthritis development given the generation of anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (acpas).  anti-citrullinated protein antibodies are pathologic in rheumatoid arthritis, but the role of the citrullinated proteins themselves is much less clear.  autoantibodies to citrullinated protein antigens are specific markers of rheumatoid arthritis (ra).  however, the molecular mechanisms driving protein citrullination in patients with rheumatoid arthritis remain poorly understood.  protein citrullination catalyzed by peptidyl arginine deiminase (pads) is involved in autoimmune disease pathogenesis, especially in rheumatoid arthritis.  to address the ongoing debate concerning the specificity of synovial citrullinated proteins for rheumatoid arthritis (ra) and to analyze their pathophysiologic relevance to the induction or perpetuation of the ra-specific anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (acpas).  dysregulated citrullination is a key element that drives the production and maintenance of antibodies to citrullinated proteins, a hallmark in rheumatoid arthritis (ra).  citrullinated proteins were detected specifically in arthritic joints and sera from pgia relative to controls.  this work suggests an important role for the interaction of synovial fibroblasts with citrullinated matrix in the pathophysiology of rheumatoid arthritis. ||| ",yes
Has proteomics been used in the study of Pick's disease?,"what is to be understood by the term pick's disease?  to examine a possible role of apoe in pick's disease, an immunohistochemical analysis was performed utilizing a novel site-directed antibody that is specific for an amino-terminal fragment of apoe.  based on these preliminary results, we suggest that some cases of pick disease may be complicated by or involve in inflammatory process.  to evaluate the possibility of inflammatory processes occurring in pick disease pathophysiology.  after a short summary of arnold pick's biography, the history of how pick's disease (pid) was reported is presented, from its clinical symptoms to its molecular characterization.  in the present study, we analyzed the regional and laminar distribution of pick bodies in a series of 16 pick's disease cases.  frontotemporal lobe atrophy is a hallmark of pick's disease (pid), however, the underlying pathobiology of the neuronal losses is unknown.  pick disease is a progressive form of dementia characterized by personality changes, speech disturbances, inattentiveness, and occasionally extrapyramidal phenomena.  pick disease should be considered in the differential diagnosis of dementia in young adults.  the fine structure of a cortical frontal biopsy of pick's disease is described.  pick's disease (pid) is a unique subtype of frontotemporal lobar degeneration characterized pathologically by aggregates of 3-repeat tau.  we report on a patient presenting pick's disease similar to the one reported by pick in 1892, with ubiquitin-positive and tau-negative inclusions.  although several variants have been recognized, the pathological profile of pick disease includes focal frontotemporal atrophy, neuronal loss, astrocytosis, pick bodies, and pick cells.  these results suggest that the presence of neurofibrillary tangles in pick's disease may be more frequent than previously reported, and that pick's disease and alzheimer's disease may coexist in certain cases.  in addition, a few pick's disease cases also had cortical senile plaques.  this study was a retrospective analysis of patients with pick's disease evaluated at mayo clinic, rochester or jacksonville (1995-2018), and identified through an existing database.  pick's disease, a form of progressive senile dementia, is distinguished by the presence of neuronal inclusions known as pick's bodies.  the presence of truncated apoe within pick bodies suggests a broader role of apoe beyond ad and raises the question as to whether this protein contributes to pathogenesis associated with pick's disease.  pick's disease is characterized morphologically by severe atrophy of the frontal and temporal lobes and the presence in the cerebral cortex of degenerative neuronal lesions referred to as pick bodies.  many reports have described loss of neurons in the substantia nigra in pick's disease (pid). ||| ",yes
Has proteomics been used in the study of the dry eye syndrome?,"we sought to examine and compare the tear film proteome of type 2 diabetic patients with or without dry eye syndrome and normal subjects using two-dimensional nano-liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (ms)-based proteomics.  therefore, this study endeavoured to investigate in-depth the tear proteome of des patients employing the mass spectrometry (ms)-based proteomic strategies.  thus, it may become a very useful tool in the search for potential biomarkers for diagnosis and new therapeutics in ocular diseases such as dry eye.  dry eye syndrome in diabetic patients is associated with aberrant expression of tear proteins, and the findings could lead to identification of novel pathways for therapeutic targeting and new diagnostic markers.  discriminant analysis demonstrated highly significant changes in the protein profiles in patients with dry eye (p < 0.001).  protein and peptides in tears play an important role in ocular surface diseases.  in previous studies, changes have been demonstrated in the electrophoretic protein profiles of patients with dry eye.  twenty-one patients with dry eye (10 nsde and 11 psde) and 20 healthy volunteers were studied.  the identification of biomarkers revealed an increase of inflammatory markers in patients with dry eye and a decrease of some proteins that may have protective functions.  the purpose of this work was to determine the usefulness of surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (seldi-tof-ms) proteinchip array (ciphergen biosystems, inc., fremont, ca) technology for the automated analysis of proteins and peptides in tear fluid.  history of dry eye symptoms was taken and the symptoms were graded.  dry eye syndrome (des) is a common eye disease caused by tear deficiency or excessive tear evaporation.  tmt-based proteomics and wgcna are used to identify the differentially expressed proteins in tear proteome of type 2 diabetes with de.  discovery proteomics strategy was employed to identify large number of significantly differentially expressed tear proteins in drylip vs. ctrl, dryaq vs. ctrl and dryaqlip vs. ctrl with 22, 58 and 67 proteins, respectively.  dry eye syndrome (des) is a complex, multifactorial, immune-associated disorder of the tear and ocular surface.  there is no gold standard/standard test for diagnosing dry eye.  to understand the pathophysiology of dry eye disease (ded), it is necessary to characterize proteins in the ocular surface fluids, including tear fluid (tf) and lacrimal fluid (lf).  so, prt can be considered equally good in detecting dry eye.  dry eye syndrome is a collection of common disorders of multifactorial etiology.  dry eye is one of the most important features of this syndrome, and a recent study reported reduced deoxyribonuclease i (dnase i) activity in the tear of patients with dry eye. ||| ",yes
Has rituximab been considered as a treatment for chronic fatigues syndrome? (November 2017),"rituximab is considered as a potential therapeutic option in relapsing-remitting (rrms) and progressive forms (pms) of multiple sclerosis (ms).  data from this registry indicate that rituximab is a commonly employed, well-tolerated therapy with potential beneficial effects in standard of care-refractory autoimmune diseases, and support the results from other open-label, uncontrolled studies.  systemic inflammatory response syndrome associated with cytokine release syndrome (crs) is a very rare entity associated with the use of rituximab and carries a very high morbidity and case fatality rate.  rituximab (rtx), an anti-cd20 monoclonal antibody, has been demonstrated to be a useful maintenance therapy for neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (nmosd).  objective: rituximab is used as an off-label treatment for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (rrms); however, the comparative efficacy and safety of rituximab versus currently licensed disease-modifying drugs (dmds) for rrms is unknown.  evidence from a number of open-label, uncontrolled studies has suggested that rituximab may benefit patients with autoimmune diseases who are refractory to standard-of-care.  treatment with rituximab seems to be safe and effective for some patients with relapsing-remitting ms who have failed to respond to first- and second-line therapies and may also be a useful option for patients with concomitant autoimmune disorders.  the objective of this study was to evaluate the safety and clinical outcomes of rituximab in several standard-of-care-refractory autoimmune diseases (within rheumatology, nephrology, dermatology and neurology) other than rheumatoid arthritis or non-hodgkin's lymphoma in a real-life clinical setting.  rituximab is a monoclonal antibody directed at cd20 positive b-lymphocytes and a potential therapeutic option in the treatment of multiple sclerosis.  to assess the effectiveness of rituximab (rtx) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (ra) in routine clinical practice, and to identify predictors of 6-month response to rtx in patients for whom at least 1 anti-tumor necrosis factor-α (anti-tnf) therapy has failed.  rituximab is a biologic agent that is usually well tolerated.  this study indicates that rituximab has long-term effects on inflammatory disease activity and that disease reactivation is rare in ms patients who discontinued treatment for any reason.  it was found that anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies may be a useful predictive biomarker for response to rituximab in patients with tnfα blocker treatment failure.  in our clinic population, rituximab was well tolerated and safe with recurrent administration.  the anti-cd20 monoclonal antibody rituximab has been used to treat patients with chronic immune thrombocytopenic purpura.  our aims were to assess the level of reported fatigue in ra patients who had achieved remission or low disease activity after 6 months of treatment with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (dmards), and to explore associations between fatigue and demographics, disease activity, and other patient-reported outcomes in this patient group.  rituximab is safe and effective for treating relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (rrms) according to phase ii and observational studies.  the objective of this study was to evaluate the effects on inflammatory disease activity after discontinuation or dose reduction of rituximab in patients with rrms or clinically isolated syndrome (cis).  despite the increased use of rituximab therapy in neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (nmosd), the overall efficacy and safety of long-term rituximab treatment in a large group of patients is uncertain.  rituximab led to an effective suppression of inflammatory activity, and at least in this specific case it represented a valid switching approach after fingolimod discontinuation. ||| ",yes
Has ruxolitinib received FDA approval?,"ruxolitinib has been approved for the treatment of myelofibrosis (mf) by the us food and drug administration (fda) in 2011 and by the european medicines agency (ema) in 2012, followed by the approval for the treatment of hydroxyurea (hu)-resistant or -intolerant polycythemia vera (pv) in 2014.  ruxolitinib is an oral selective janus-associated kinase 1 (jak1) and jak2 inhibitor that was initially approved by the fda in 2014 for treatment of myelofibrosis.  ruxolitinib (inc424), a potent and selective oral janus kinase 1 and 2 inhibitor, was recently approved by the us food and drug administration for the treatment of intermediate or high-risk myelofibrosis.  considerable clinical experience regarding the long-term efficacy and safety of ruxolitinib has been gathered since the drug was approved in the usa for patients with intermediate or high-risk myelofibrosis (mf) in november 2011.  ruxolitinib, a jak1/jak2 inhibitor, is currently the only pharmacological agent approved for the treatment of myelofibrosis.  the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (pk) of ruxolitinib have been extensively evaluated in healthy subjects and patients.  ruxolitinib is an oral janus-activated kinase 1 (jak1)/jak2 inhibitor approved for the treatment of patients with myelofibrosis based on the results of two randomized clinical trials.  the janus kinase inhibitor ruxolitinib is approved for the treatment of myelofibrosis (mf) and improved overall survival (os) versus control therapy in the phase 3 comfort trials.  ruxolitinib (incb018424) is a jak1 and jak2 inhibitor recently evaluated for the treatment of myelofibrosis (mf) in early- and advanced-phase clinical trials.  ruxolitinib was well-tolerated with one dlt per cohort of six patients at dose levels (dls) 2-5.  orally administered ruxolitinib was well tolerated in healthy japanese volunteers.  the national institute for health and care excellence (nice) invited the manufacturer of ruxolitinib (novartis) to submit clinical and cost-effectiveness evidence for ruxolitinib within its licensed indication (the treatment of disease-related splenomegaly or symptoms in adult patients with myelofibrosis), according to the institute's single technology appraisal process.  while the exact mechanism for action in gvhd is not yet fully understood, prospective studies are ongoing and some patients are receiving ruxolitinib in the setting of steroid refractory gvhd.  ruxolitinib, an orally bioavailable jak1/jak2 inhibitor, may treat cancers with crlf2 and/or jak pathway mutations.  the present study is the first to investigate the pk and tolerability of ruxolitinib in the japanese population.  ruxolitinib is a janus kinase (jak) (jak1/jak2) inhibitor that has demonstrated superiority over placebo and best available therapy (bat) in the controlled myelofibrosis study with oral jak inhibitor treatment (comfort) studies.  these findings suggest ruxolitinib might be a possible therapeutic candidate for sepsis therapy.  subsequent evaluation of ruxolitinib in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy in children, adolescents, and young adults with jak-mutant leukemias is planned.  since recently, ruxolitinib is also under investigation for the treatment of graft-versus-host disease (gvhd) after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (hsct).  ruxolitinib is an inhibitor of janus kinases (jak) 1/2. ||| ",yes
Has silicon been used in treatment of  incontinence ?,"in addition, silicones have been used extensively in medical practice as a lubricant in tubing and syringes, and as implantable devices.  silicones have wide use in medical practice, including lubricants in tubing and syringes, and as implantable devices.  silicones are commonly used for lubrication of syringes, encapsulation of medical devices, and fabrication of surgical implants.  silicone materials have been used in medical applications for at least 30 years.  the liquid form of silicone, called dimethicone (dimethylpolysiloxane), has been used extensively in some countries during the past 4 decades for soft tissue augmentation.  a silicone widely used in medical practice is polydimethylsiloxane.  rarely, men use physiologic salt solution or liquid silicone injected into the subcutaneous tissue of the scrotum, the penis, the upper genital or the inguinal region.  female stress urinary incontinence (sui) is often treated surgically.  a 24-year-old man who had vur (grade ii) and renal insufficiency was treated by endoscopic injection of silicone.  for over five decades, liquid injectable silicone has been used for soft-tissue augmentation.  this case describes the first case of ses of a male patient who presented to a community emergency department complaining of dyspnea after an episode of self-administered injectable silicone into his penis and scrotum and who developed ses-induced respiratory failure.  silicone has been used in a variety of forms as a replacement for soft tissue for more than three decades in the united states.  silicone has been considered biologically inert; thus it has been employed in many medical devices and nowadays is commonly used in plastic surgery for mammary prosthesis.  those men, who call themselves ""siliconers"", want to get a larger penis and scrotum, also visible when wearing clothes.  silicone has been commonly used for both major and minor plastic and reconstructive surgery for decades.  silicone has been utilized as an implant in reconstructive surgery.  silicone embolism syndrome (ses) is a well known complication after injection of silicone gel as well as liquid silicone.  even though silicone is considered to be an inert material, there are side effects that have been reported, such as silicone lymphadenopathy.  millions of people have been exposed to silicones because of the widespread use in consumer products such as cosmetics and toiletries, food products, household products and paints.  millions of people have been exposed to silicones which are present in consumer goods such as cosmetics and toiletries, processed foods and household products. ||| ",yes
Has single guide RNA been used on human cells?,"these data expand the use of single-stranded rna to cell nuclei.  rnai using single-strand rna would provide new options for therapeutic development and for investigating critical questions of mechanism.  here we report findings supporting an alternative strategy in which an endogenous human rna polymerase (rnap) is harnessed to make rna hairpin-containing small rna from synthetic single-stranded dna oligonucleotides.  synthetic rna formulations and viral vectors are the two main approaches for delivering small therapeutic rna to human cells.  using chemically modified single-strands, we test the hypothesis that single-stranded rnas can engage the rnai pathway and silence gene transcription.  an external guide sequence (egs) is a rna sequence which can interact with a target mrna to form a tertiary structure like a pre-trna and recruit intracellular ribonuclease p (rnase p), a trna processing enzyme, to degrade target mrna.  external guide sequences (egss) are rna molecules that can bind to a target mrna and direct ribonuclease p (rnase p), a trna processing enzyme, for specific cleavage of the target mrna.  this finding enables the design of highly effective single-oligo compounds for any mrna target.  we designed an alternative shrna molecule with a relatively short base-paired stem that bypasses dicer and instead is processed by the argonaute 2 (ago2) protein into a single guide rna strand that effectively induces rnai.  the introduction of 21-23 nucleotide rna duplexes, termed small interfering rnas (sirnas), into mammalian cells can specifically degrade homologous mrnas.  rna is considered a highly promising candidate for several applications such as gene knock-down, gene repair and gene therapy, where double-stranded rna and rna with catalytic activity are key players.  hyperstable u1snrna might be a novel approach to express effective antisense rna in target cells.  using an in vitro selection procedure, we have previously generated egs variants that efficiently direct human rnase p to cleave a target mrna in vitro.  here we describe a novel class of rnai molecules composed of a single 25-28-nucleotide (nt) oligo.  in this study, we utilised u1 small nuclear rna (snrna) that binds physiologically to the 5' splice site (5'ss) of pre-mrna, to develop a novel vector system that permits imposed binding of antisense rna to its target.  previously, an in vitro selection procedure has been used by us to engineer new egss that are more robust in inducing human rnase p to cleave their targeted mrnas.  nucleic acid-based gene interfering approaches, such as those mediated by rna interference and rnase p-associated external guide sequence (egs), have emerged as promising antiviral strategies.  furthermore, these results demonstrate the potential for engineered egs rnas to be developed and used as anti-hsv therapeutics.  rna interference (rnai) has been established as an important tool for functional genomics studies and has great promise as a therapeutic intervention for human diseases.  ribonuclease p (rnase p) complexed with external guide sequence (egs) represents a novel nucleic acid-based gene interference approach to modulate gene expression. ||| ",yes
Has small pox been eradicated from the world?,"despite the successful eradication of smallpox by the who-led vaccination programme, pox virus infections remain a considerable health threat.  currently, smallpox, caused by the variola virus belonging to the poxvirus family, has been completely eradicated according to the who.  following successful vaccination campaigns through the 19th and 20th centuries, smallpox was declared eradicated by the world health organization in 1980.  as yet, the only human infectious disease eradicated from our planet is smallpox, caused by variola virus a member of the poxvirus family.  although various attempts have been made to eradicate infectious diseases, only smallpox has been eradicated to date.  to date, the only infectious disease that has been eradicated is smallpox.  smallpox eradication was a rare event.  however, smallpox has not totally disappeared from people's minds because of its potential use as a biological weapon.  smallpox was the first human disease to be eradicated, through a concerted vaccination campaign led by the world health organization.  with more than 2 years having elapsed since the last case of paralytic poliomyelitis occurred in the western hemisphere, significant progress has been made towards the global eradication of wild polioviruses.  eradication is the permanent reduction to zero of the worldwide incidence of infection caused by a specific agent as a result of deliberate efforts; intervention measures are no longer needed.  the global poliomyelitis eradication initiative has been a tremendous success, with current evidence suggesting that wild poliovirus will cease to circulate anywhere in the world soon after the year 2000.  prior to the world health organization's announcement of total eradication in 1977  naturally occurring smallpox was eradicated as a result of successful vaccination campaigns during the 1960s and 1970s.  the concept of disease eradication emerged as recently as the mid-20th century.  the eradication of smallpox was announced by the who in 1980.  in 1980, the world health organization eradication program discontinued vaccination for smallpox and declared that the disease had been eliminated.  in the last century, smallpox was declared eradicated from the human community; however, the mechanisms responsible for the emergence of new dangerous pathogens have yet to be unraveled.  the successful eradication of smallpox resulted in the concept of the extinction of the causative agent in man as well as in the environment, leading to the cessation of all control measures including vaccination.  since its eradication, routine vaccination against smallpox has ceased, leaving the world population susceptible to disease caused by orthopoxviruses. ||| ",yes
Has the fungus Ashbya gossypii got many nuclei that share cytoplasm?,"in the multinucleate filamentous fungus ashbya gossypii, nuclei divide asynchronously in a common cytoplasm.  nuclei in the filamentous, multinucleated fungus ashbya gossypii divide asynchronously.  we use a dynactin mutant strain of the multinucleate fungus ashbya gossypii with highly clustered nuclei to assess the relative contributions of nucleus and cytoplasm to nuclear autonomy.  we analyzed a unique asynchronous nuclear division cycle in a multinucleated filamentous fungus, ashbya gossypii.  ashbya gossypii is a riboflavin-overproducing filamentous fungus that is closely related to unicellular yeasts such as saccharomyces cerevisiae.  in the hyphae of the plant pathogenic fungus ashbya gossypii, nuclei move back and forth, occasionally bypassing each other, preventing the formation of nuclear clusters.  the filamentous fungus ashbya gossypii grows into a multicellular mycelium that is distinct from the unicellular morphology of its closely related yeast species.  ashbya gossypii is a filamentous ascomycete belonging to the yeast family of saccharomycetaceae.  to evaluate if the cell cycle state of nuclei in a. gossypii can influence the adjacent cytoplasm, we tested whether local mitochondrial morphology and membrane potential in a. gossypii are associated with the division state of a nearby nucleus.  the riboflavin producer ashbya gossypii is a filamentous hemiascomycete, closely related to the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae, that has been used as a model organism to study fungal developmental biology.  ashbya gossypii has a budding yeast-like genome but grows exclusively as multinucleated hyphae.  nuclear pedigree analysis and observation of gfp-labeled spindle pole bodies demonstrated that neighboring nuclei in a. gossypii cells are in different cell cycle stages despite close physical proximity.  a. gossypii is a homothallic fungus which may possess a and α mating types.  previous studies with ashbya gossypii revealed extensive bidirectional movements and bypassings of nuclei, an autonomous cytoplasmic microtubule (cmt) cytoskeleton emanating from each nucleus, and pulling of nuclei by sliding of cmts along the cortex.  in the filamentous ascomycete ashbya gossypii, like in other filamentous fungi onset of growth in dormant spores occurs as an isotropic growth phase generating spherical germ cells.  in contrast to budding yeast where positioning of nuclei at the bud neck is a major function of cytoplasmic microtubules (cmts), a. gossypii nuclei are constantly in motion and positioning is not an issue.  the filamentous fungus ashbya gossypii is a cotton pathogen transmitted by insects.  during filamentous fungus development, multinucleated hyphae employ a system for long-range nuclear migration to maintain an equal nuclear density.  in the multinucleate filamentous fungus ashbya gossypii, the rna-binding protein whi3 regulates the cell cycle and cell polarity through forming macromolecular structures that behave like condensates.  truncated neutral n-glycan structures similar to those found in other filamentous fungi (man4-7glcnac2) were detected, suggesting the possible existence of trimming activity in a. gossypii. ||| ",yes

Has the protein GFP been used in transgenesis for live protein imaging?,"while gfp and various types of engineered fluorescent proteins (fps) have been actively used for live cell imaging for many years, the size and the limited windows of fluorescent spectra of gfp and its variants set limits on possible applications.  during the last decade live cell imaging using fluorochromes like green fluorescent protein (gfp) directly attached to the protein of interest has become increasingly popular.  green fluorescence protein (gfp) has become a widely used reporter in many areas of life science.  the recent emergence of an autofluorescent protein, the green fluorescent protein (gfp), has opened the door for the convenient use of intact living cells and organisms as experimental systems in fields ranging from cell biology to biomedicine.  the green fluorescent protein (gfp) is currently being used for diverse cellular biology approaches, mainly as a protein tag or to monitor gene expression.  since the cloning and the eterologous expression of the green fluorescence protein (gfp), a number of applications have been reported where protein location within the cell or gene expression is revealed by fluorescent imaging of living cells.  since its discovery, green fluorescence protein (gfp) has been used as a reporter in a broad range of applications, including the determination of gene expresion in diverse organisms, and subcellular protein localization.  the green fluorescent protein (gfp) has revolutionized cell biology.  we present an overview of some of the major applications of gfp, namely its use in protein tagging and in monitoring gene expression as well as its potential in a variety of biological screens.  green fluorescent protein (gfp) has played an important role in biochemistry and cell biology as a reporter gene.  now, new gfp technologies allow far more than simple observations of fusion protein localization.  when fused to peptides or proteins as a reporter, gfp enables localization and quantitation of gene products in otherwise unmanipulated live cells or organisms.  owing to its autofluorescence properties, green fluorescent protein (gfp) has aroused increasing interest as a marker system for many research applications.  the green fluorescent protein (gfp) has been widely used in cell biology as a marker of gene expression, label of cellular structures, fusion tag or as a crucial constituent of genetically encoded biosensors.  green fluorescent protein (gfp) and other fluorescent proteins are essential tools for biological research.  green fluorescent protein (gfp) was the first example of fluorescent reporters genetically introduced to protein of interest (poi).  the visualization of a protein of interest is most commonly achieved by genetically fusing it to green fluorescent protein (gfp) or one of it variants.  the availability of green fluorescent protein (gfp) as a tracer for observing proteins in living cells has revolutionized cell biology and spurred an intensive search for gfp variants with novel characteristics, additional autofluorescent proteins and alternative techniques of protein labelling.  in this study we investigated the suitability of the ""enhanced"" gfp (egfp), a mutant version of gfp optimized for flow cytometry and microscopy detection, as a reporter gene for retroviral transduction protocols.  green fluorescent protein (gfp) has been used as a marker of gene expression and a single cell marker in living organisms in cell biology studies. ||| ",yes
Has the protein SETMAR (Metnase) a transposase domain?,"metnase has a nuclease domain that shares homology with the transposase family.  metnase, also known as setmar, is a set and transposase fusion protein with an undefined role in mammalian dna repair.  metnase (setmar) is a set and transposase fusion protein that promotes in vivo end joining activity and mediates genomic integration of foreign dna.  metnase (also known as setmar) is a chimeric set-transposase protein that plays essential role(s) in non-homologous end joining (nhej) repair and replication fork restart.  metnase (also known as setmar) is a set and transposase fusion protein in humans and plays a positive role in double-strand break (dsb) repair.  metnase is a fusion gene comprising a set histone methyl transferase domain and a transposase domain derived from the mariner transposase.  metnase (setmar) is a set-transposase fusion protein that promotes nonhomologous end joining (nhej) repair in humans.  one of these ""domesticated"", transposase-derived factors is setmar/metnase which is a naturally occurring fusion protein that consists of a histone-lysine methyltransferase domain and an hsmar1 transposase.  although the human genome is littered with sequences derived from the hsmar1 transposon, the only intact hsmar1 transposase gene exists within a chimeric set-transposase fusion protein referred to as metnase or setmar.  although the metnase transposase domain has been largely conserved, its catalytic motif (ddn) differs from the ddd motif of related transposases, which may be important for its role as a dna repair factor and its enzymatic activities.  metnase (or setmar) arose from a chimeric fusion of the hsmar1 transposase downstream of a protein methylase in anthropoid primates.  recent studies showed that metnase retained most of the transposase activities, including 5'-terminal inverted repeat (tir)-specific binding and assembly of a paired end complex, and cleavage of the 5'-end of the tir element.  although both set and the transposase domains were necessary for its function in dsb repair, it is not clear what specific role metnase plays in the nhej.  the metnase fusion gene consists of a set histone methyltransferase domain and a transposase domain from mariner transposase.  the metnase transposase has been remarkably conserved through evolution; however, there is a clustering of substitutions located in alpha helices 4 and 5 within the putative dna-binding site, consistent with loss of transposition specific dna cleavage activity and acquisition of dna repair specific cleavage activity.  together, our results suggest that the metnase set domain has a positive role in restart of replication fork and the 5' end of ss-overhang cleavage, providing a new insight into the functional interaction of the set and the transposase domains.  here, we present two crystal structures of the transposase catalytic domain of metnase revealing a dimeric enzyme with unusual active site plasticity that may be involved in modulating metal binding.  although the transposase domain is essential for metnase function in dna repair, it is not clear how a protein with sequence-specific dna binding activity plays a role in dna repair.  together, our results suggest that metnase's dna cleavage activity, unlike those of other eukaryotic transposases, is not coupled to its sequence-specific dna binding.  setmar is a fusion between a set-domain methyltransferase gene and a mariner-family transposase gene, which is specific to anthropoid primates. ||| ",yes
Has the protein TIEG1 been associated with apoptosis?,"although the newly identified protein tumor necrosis factor α-induced protein 8-like 1 (tnfaip8l1), also known as tipe1, has been reported to be able to induce apoptosis in human hepatocellular carcinoma cells, the involvement of tipe1 in apoptosis remains to be elucidated.  these findings suggest that tl1 may act as an autocrine factor to induce apoptosis in endothelial cells via activation of multiple signaling pathways, including stress protein kinases as well as certain caspases.  although some studies have suggested that tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (trail) might be involved in atherosclerosis, its potential role in endothelial dysfunction and apoptosis has not been investigated.  the present study was undertaken to explore whether tl1 induces apoptosis in endothelial cells and, if so, to explore its mechanism of action.  tipe1 (tumor necrosis factor-α-induced protein 8-like 1 or tnfaip8l1) is a newly identified member of the tipe (tnfaip8) family, which play roles in regulating cell death.  these results indicated that tipe1 could promote the apoptosis of raw264.7 cells by upregulating the pro-apoptotic members of the bcl-2 family of proteins, and that the mapks signaling pathway was not involved in the pro-apoptotic effect of tipe1.  tipe1 (tumor necrosis factor-α-induced protein 8-like 1 or tnfaip8l1) belongs to the tipe (tnfaip8) family, which act as a regulator of cell death.  consequently, these data provide the first evidence that targeted silencing of tigar induces apoptotic and autophagic cell death in hepg2 cells, and our data raise hope for the future successful application of tigar sirna in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc).  surprisingly, tfeb promotes rather than inhibits apoptosis in response to 15d-pgj2.  tipe1 (tumor necrosis factor-α-induced protein 8-like 1) contributes to cell death in diverse cancers.  here we investigated the role of pctaire1 in apoptosis, especially in the extrinsic cell death pathway.  the cell apoptosis rate was detected by flow cytometry.  our findings revealed that tipe1 induced apoptosis in hcc cells by negatively regulating rac1 pathway, and loss of tipe1 might be a new prognostic indicator for hcc patients.  tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (trail) serves as an extracellular signal triggering apoptosis in tumor cells.  tipe2, also known as tnfaip8l2, a member of the tumor necrosis factor-alpha-induced protein-8 (tnfaip8) family, is known as an inhibitor in inflammation and cancer, and its overexpression induces cell death.  so far, the function of apoptosis mediated by tia-1 has been extensively studied in higher animals, and apoptosis happens to be related to biological immune defense.  we examined the role of tipe2 with respect to adjuvant arthritis (aa)-associated pathogenesis by analyzing the tipe2 regulation of death receptor (dr5)-mediated apoptosis in vitro.  this work not only evidences how tfeb is activated by 15d-pgj2, but also unveils a previously unexplored role of ros-dependent activation of tfeb in modulating cell apoptosis in response to 15d-pgj2.  it may be involved in the induction of apoptosis in target cells during lymphocyte attack.  taken together, our results suggest that oxidative stress mediates trail-induced apoptosis in hela cells. ||| ",yes
Has the proteome of mice hippocampus been analysed?,"molecules that govern the formation, integrity, and function of the hippocampus remain an important area of investigation.  a proteomic approach based on two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-de) coupled with mass spectrometry  has been chosen to address this question by determining strain-dependent levels of metabolic proteins in hippocampal tissue of four inbred and one outbred mouse strain.  here, we accurately quantitatively studied the hippocampal microstructure changes in alzheimer's disease model mice and analyzed the relationship between the hippocampal microstructure changes and learning and memory.  strain-specific variation of metabolic protein levels in the hippocampus among various commonly used mouse strains, however, has not been investigated yet.  electrophysiological recordings of synaptic responses were made using hippocampal slices prepared from mice whose behaviour had been analysed.  here, we analyzed the temporal changes of the mouse hippocampal synaptic membrane proteome 1 and 4 h after contextual fear learning, comparing two groups; (1) a fear memory forming ""delayed-shock"" group and (2) a fear memory-deficient ""immediate-shock"" group.  the mouse brain has been subjected to intensive scrutiny in this regard; however, a multitude of studies has examined synaptic plasticity in the hippocampal slice preparation, whereas very few have addressed synaptic plasticity in the freely behaving mouse.  although this mouse shows abnormalities in cognitive function that implicate hippocampus as well as marked deficits in hippocampal long-term potentiation, the structure of the hippocampus has been little studied.  furthermore, data presented herein emphasize the significance of the genetic background for the analysis of metabolic pathways in the hippocampus in wild-type mice as well as in gene-targeting experiments.  we have investigated synaptic function in the hippocampus in mice of different ages carrying a null mutation in the prp gene.  the hippocampus has long been implicated in memory formation.  although accumulating evidence suggests involvement of the hippocampus in other brain functions including locomotor regulation and emotional processes, cellular and synaptic bases underlying these functions remain largely unknown.  thus, automated and efficient hippocampal-sensitive cognitive tests for the mouse are important for developing therapeutic targets for these diseases, and understanding brain-behaviour relationships.  here we show that absence of the proneuropeptide processing enzyme, carboxypeptidase e (cpe) in cpe knock-out (ko) mice had a profound effect on memory, synaptic physiology, and the cytoarchitecture of the hippocampus in these animals.  strain-specific protein levels of metabolic proteins in the mouse hippocampus may provide some insight into the molecular underpinnings and genetic determination of strain-dependent neuronal function.  we used a 9,000 gene microarray to examine differences in hippocampal gene expression between two f1 hybrid mouse strains that perform well on the morris water maze and two inbred strains that perform poorly.  the importance of the hippocampus to learning and memory has attracted significant attention to how the structure responds to damage.  the hippocampus is implicated in many of the cognitive impairments observed in conditions such as alzheimer's disease (ad) and schizophrenia (scz).  the role of the hippocampus in non-spatial memory has been issue of some controversy.  lesion and pharmacological intervention studies have suggested that in both human patients and animals the hippocampus plays a crucial role in the rapid acquisition and storage of information from a novel one-time experience. ||| ",yes
Has vitamin D has been shown to reduce incidence of falls in older people in clinical trials?,"a number of studies have hypothesized that vitamin d is a potential factor in the prevention of falls in the elderly; however, the effect of vitamin d is still inconsistent and not quantitative.  meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials (rcts) have shown a decreased risk of falls in elderly treated with vitamin d supplements, which may be due to an improved neuromuscular function in vitamin d-replete subjects.  through a 15-year literature overview, and after a brief reminder on mechanism of falls in older adults, we reported evidences for a vitamin d action on postural adaptations - i.e., muscles and central nervous system - which may explain the decreased fall and bone fracture rates and we underlined the reasons for differences and controversies between published data.  vitamin d combined with calcium reduces the risk of falls.  vitamin d affects bone and muscle health and likely reduces the risk of falls in the elderly.  the aim of this systematic review is to summarize the existing evidence on vitamin d use and the risk of falls.  we review the potential of vitamin d for the prevention of falls and fractures.  vitamin d use was associated with statistically significant reduction in the risk of falls (odds ratio for suffering at least one fall, 0.86; 95% confidence interval, 0.77-0.96).  eligible studies were randomized controlled trials in which the intervention was vitamin d and the incidence of falls was reported.  we conducted this meta-analysis to assess the effect of vitamin d on falls among elderly individuals.  to determine the effectiveness of targeted exercise training and vitamin d supplementation in reducing falls and injurious falls among older women.  there is increasing evidence that a supplementation of vitamin d and/or of calcium may reduce the fall and fracture rates.  vitamin d supplementation reduces the incidence of fractures in older adults.  there is evidence that disability severity and fall rates may be reduced by adequate vitamin d replacement.  we sought to determine whether monthly high-dose vitamin d supplementation reduces risk and incidence of falls.  because low levels of vitamin d have been associated with increased fall rates, many trials have been performed with vitamin d; two meta-analyses showed either a small effect or no effect of vitamin d on falls.  vitamin d supplementation should thus be integrated into primary and secondary fall prevention strategies in older adults.  this suggests that vitamin d supplementation improves neuromuscular or neuroprotective function, which may in part explain the mechanism whereby vitamin d reduces falls and fractures.  randomized controlled trials have shown that a combination of vitamin d and calcium can prevent fragility fractures in the elderly.  this randomized controlled trial will investigate the effects of an oral vitamin d loading dose with maintenance oral vitamin d and calcium on lower extremity function (gait velocity), correction of hypovitaminosis d, falls, and fractures among older people after hip fracture surgery. ||| ",yes
Has whole exome sequencing been performed in Alzheimer patients?,"in this study, we performed the whole-exome sequencing of han chinese patients with familial and/or early-onset alzheimer's disease, followed by independent validation, imaging analysis and function characterization.  we assessed the results of genome sequencing for early-onset dementia.  here, we perform deep whole-exome sequencing (average read depth 584×) in 111 postmortem hippocampal formation and matched blood samples from 52 patients with ad and 11 individuals not affected by ad.  in summary, genome sequencing for early-onset dementia frequently identified multiple established or possible contributory alleles.  the detailed characteristics of neuronal cell populations in alzheimer's disease (ad) using single-cell rna sequencing have not been fully elucidated.  to explore the characterization of neuronal cell populations in ad, this study utilized the publicly available single-nucleus rna-sequencing datasets in the transgenic model of 5x familial alzheimer's disease (5xfad) and wild-type mice to reveal an ad-associated excitatory neuron population (c3:ex.neuron).  here, we performed cross-study large-scale transcriptomic analyses of postmortem prefrontal cortex derived from alzheimer's disease patients to reveal the role of aberrant gene expression in this disease.  this new sequencing technology is useful for detecting genetic variations in familial ad.  we developed an integrated database named scread (single-cell rna-seq database for alzheimer's disease), which is as far as we know the first database dedicated to the management of all the existing scrna-seq and snrna-seq data sets from the human postmortem brain tissue with ad and mouse models with ad pathology.  alzheimer's disease (ad) is affected by apolipoprotein e (apoe); however, its effects assessed by means of cognitive tests and by neuroimaging have not been sufficiently studied.  we validated our single-nucleus rna sequencing findings in an expanded cohort of ad cases, demonstrating that apoe and trem2 risk variants are associated with a significant reduction in cd163-positive amyloid-responsive microglia.  we identified that one of the most prominent changes in prefrontal cortex of alzheimer's disease humans was the downregulation of genes in excitatory and inhibitory neurons that are associated with synaptic functions, particularly the snare-binding complex, which is essential for vesicle docking and neurotransmitter release.  the single-cell rna-sequencing (scrna-seq) and single-nucleus rna-sequencing (snrna-seq) techniques are extremely useful for dissecting the function/dysfunction of highly heterogeneous cells in the brain at the single-cell level, and the corresponding data analyses can significantly improve our understanding of why particular cells are vulnerable in ad.  this study has revealed potential molecular targets for therapeutic intervention of cognitive decline associated with alzheimer's disease.  alzheimer's disease is the most common neurodegenerative disease, and has a high level of genetic heritability and population heterogeneity.  using single-nucleus rna sequencing of postmortem human brain with varied apoe and trem2 genotypes and neuropathology, we identified distinct microglia subpopulations, including a subpopulation of cd163-positive amyloid-responsive microglia (arm) that are depleted in cases with apoe and trem2 risk variants.  alzheimer's disease (ad) is one of the most common neurodegenerative disorders.  alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder associated with memory loss and impaired executive function.  here we adopted an unbiased lipidomics and metabolomics approach to surveying frozen frontal cortex samples from clinically characterized ad patients (n = 21) and age-matched controls (n = 19), revealing marked molecular differences between them.  alzheimer's disease (ad) is the most common, and, arguably, one of the most-well studied, neurodegenerative conditions. ||| ",yes
Have 5q35 microdeletions been implicated in Sotos syndrome development?,"patients with sotos syndrome show 5q35 deletions involving nsd1 or its point mutations.  haploinsufficiency of the human 5q35 region spanning the nsd1 gene results in a rare genomic disorder known as sotos syndrome (sotos), with patients displaying a variety of clinical features, including pre- and postnatal overgrowth, intellectual disability, and urinary/renal abnormalities.  we identified the common 5q35 deletion in a patient with atypical sotos syndrome manifesting extremely severe developmental delay, joint hypermobility, and skin hyperextensibility, which are recognized as marfanoid hypermobility syndrome.  haploinsufficiency of the nuclear receptor set domain-containing protein 1 (nsd1) gene located on 5q35 has been implicated as the cause of sotos syndrome.  loss-of-function mutations of nsd1 and 5q35 microdeletions encompassing nsd1 are a major cause of sotos syndrome (sos), which is characterized by overgrowth, macrocephaly, characteristic facies, and variable intellectual disability (id).  sotos syndrome is a well-known overgrowth syndrome caused by haploinsufficiency of nsd1 gene located at 5q35.  cytogenetic studies were performed to confirm 5q35 microdeletion, and nsd1 sequencing analysis was performed to identify intragenic mutations.  sotos syndrome, which is characterized by overgrowth, macrocephaly, distinctive facial features, and developmental delay, arises from mutations and deletions of the nsd1 gene at 5q35.3.  sotos syndrome is an overgrowth syndrome characterized by macrocephaly, advanced bone age, characteristic facial features, and learning disabilities, caused by mutations or deletions of the nsd1 gene, located at 5q35.  eight cases of 5q35 deletions and one patient with an intragenic nsd1 mutation with transient hi have been reported.  our findings suggest that sotos syndrome is a rare cause of autism spectrum disorders and that screening for nsd1 mutations and deletions in patients with autism and macrocephaly is not warranted in the absence of other features of sotos syndrome.  prior genomic studies have suggested that haploinsufficiency of multiple 5q31.2 genes may contribute to mds pathogenesis.  we investigated detailed craniofacial, dental, and oral findings in five patients with deletion type, and three patients with mutation type sotos syndrome.  specifically, the interstitial deletion of chromosome 5q33.3q35.1, an extremely rare chromosomal aberration, is characterized by mental retardation, developmental delay, and facial dysmorphism.  chromosomal microarray analysis using the comparative genomic hybridization array method revealed a 16-mb-long deletion of 5q33.  these patients with persistent hi and sotos syndrome caused by nsd1 mutations, further dispel the hypothesis that hi is due to the deletion of other genes in the deleted 5q35 region.  severe mental retardation has been described in most patients who present 5q deletions.  constitutional interstitial deletions of the long arm of chromosome 5 (5q) are quite rare, and the corresponding phenotype is not yet clearly delineated.  sotos syndrome has been described in a number of patients with autism spectrum disorders, suggesting that nsd1 could be involved in other cases of autism and macrocephaly.  here, we report a case of a de novo deletion of 5q33.3q35.1, 46,xy,del(5)(q33.3q35.1) in an 11-year-old boy with mental retardation; to the best of our knowledge this is the first case in korea to be reported. ||| ",yes
Have C12orf65 mutations been associated with axonal neuropathy and optic atrophy?,"our study broadens the phenotypic spectrum of c12orf65 defects and highlights the triad of optic atrophy, axonal neuropathy and spastic paraparesis as its key clinical features.  c12orf65 participates in the process of mitochondrial translation and has been shown to be associated with a spectrum of phenotypes, including early onset optic atrophy, progressive encephalomyopathy, peripheral neuropathy, and spastic paraparesis.we used whole-genome homozygosity mapping as well as exome sequencing and targeted gene sequencing to identify novel c12orf65 disease-causing mutations in seven affected individuals originating from two consanguineous families.  additional neurological features have recently been described in seven families transmitting pathogenic mutations in opa1, the most common cause of autosomal dominant optic atrophy.  optic atrophy type 1, caused by mutations in the opa1 gene is believed to be the most common hereditary optic neuropathy, and most patients inherit a mutation from an affected parent.  defective mitochondrial function attributed to optic atrophy 1 (opa1) mutations causes primarily optic atrophy and, less commonly, neurodegenerative syndromes.  optic nerve atrophy represents the most common form of hereditary optic neuropathies leading to vision impairment.  to review the molecular genetic basis of primary inherited optic neuropathies.  few cases harboring compound heterozygous opa1 mutations have been described manifesting complex neurodegenerative disorders in addition to optic atrophy.  inherited optic neuropathies are a genetically diverse group of disorders that present with reduced visual acuity and the clinical appearance of optic atrophy.  in four family members affected with childhood-onset optic atrophy accompanied by slowly progressive peripheral neuropathy and spastic paraparesis, we identified a homozygous frame shift mutation c.413_417 delaacaa, which predicts a truncated protein lacking the c-terminal portion.  mild optic neuropathy has been associated with spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (sca1), but macular dysfunction has been reported in only 2 cases.  hereditary optic neuropathies comprise a group of clinically and genetically heterogeneous disorders.  in this review, the natural history of the common inherited optic neuropathies, the presumed pathogenesis of several of these disorders, and the literature to date regarding potential therapies are summarized.  heterozygous mutations in opa1 are a common cause of autosomal dominant optic atrophy, sometimes associated with extra-ocular manifestations.  in this large multi-centre study of 104 patients from 45 independent families, including 60 new cases, we show that extra-ocular neurological complications are common in opa1 disease, and affect up to 20% of all mutational carriers.  in the second family, we studied three affected individuals who presented with early onset optic atrophy, peripheral neuropathy, and spastic gait in addition to moderate intellectual disability.  mutations in nuclear or mitochondrial dna may cause disorders of neuro-ophthalmic significance.  a gene for recessive optic atrophy (opa3) has also been identified.  the recently described bosch-boonstra-schaaf optic atrophy (bbsoa) syndrome denotes an autosomal dominant genetic form of neuropathy caused by mutations or deletions in the nr2f1 gene.  the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the hereditary optic neuropathies involve mitochondrial dysfunction owing to mutations in mitochondrial or nuclear dna that encodes proteins essential to mitochondrial function. ||| ",yes
Have Quantitative Trait Loci affecting splicing (splicing QTLs) been linked to disease?,"genetic variants regulating rna splicing and transcript usage have been implicated in both common and rare diseases.  some of these snps may contribute to disease by regulating gene splicing.  specifically, we hypothesize that single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) in splicing regulatory elements can be characterized in silico to identify variants affecting splicing, and that these variants may contribute to the etiology of complex diseases as well as the inter-individual variability in the ratios of alternative transcripts.  many sqtl-associated genes (40%) undergo alternative splicing.  dna variants that affect alternative splicing and the relative quantities of different gene transcripts have been shown to be risk alleles for some mendelian diseases.  here, we investigate whether snps that are associated with alternative splicing (splice qtl or sqtl) can identify novel functions for existing gwas variants or suggest new associated variants in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd).  we investigated splicing quantitative trait loci (sqtls) in 1,209 samples from 13 human brain regions, using rna sequencing (rna-seq) and genotype data from the genotype-tissue expression (gtex) project.  the overarching goal of this study is to discover and characterize the role that variants affecting alternative splicing may play in the genetic etiology of complex traits, which include a significant number of the common human diseases.  substantial progress has been made in the identification of sequence elements that control mrna splicing and the genetic variants in these elements that alter mrna splicing (referred to as splicing quantitative trait loci - sqtls).  an understanding of the genetic variation underlying transcript splicing is essential to dissect the molecular mechanisms of common disease.  integrating the binding motifs and expression patterns of rna binding proteins with exon splicing profiles, we uncovered likely causal variants underlying brain region-specific sqtls.  evidence linking causative snps to individual splicing differences between individuals is emerging and this may lead to a better understanding of susceptibilities related to rare drug-induced toxicities.  this report highlights a genomics platform developed to measure splicing changes that occur in response to drug exposures, and therefore is applicable for the study of drug-induced toxicity.  in particular, we demonstrated that snps in a known copd gwas locus on chromosome 5q32 influence alternative splicing in the gene fbxo38.  genome-wide rna splicing (with gene expression) can be used to discover variations that drive specific diseases and / or change the susceptibility in individuals to drug responses including tissue specific toxicities.  we carried out a transcriptome-wide analysis of the effects of a mutation in a ubiquitous splicing factor that causes retinitis pigmentosa (rp) on mrna splicing, using exon microarrays.  genetic variation of alternative splicing is a prevalent source of transcriptomic and proteomic diversity in human populations.  the available evidence from splicing quantitative trait locus (sqtl) studies has been limited to small samples.  we leverage high-throughput expression profiling to 1) experimentally validate our in silico predictions of skipped exons and 2) characterize the molecular role of intronic genetic variations in alternative splicing events in the context of complex human traits and diseases.  overall, these data indicate that analysis of alternative splicing can provide novel insights into disease mechanisms. ||| ",yes
Have germline variants been associated to colorectal cancer?,"genome-wide association studies (gwas) have identified several loci harboring variants that affected the risk of colorectal cancer; however, the specific mechanisms by which germline variation influenced the tumorigenesis of colorectal cancer (crc) remains unrevealed.  inactivation of e-cadherin is common in colorectal cancer, and truncating germline mutations have been reported to confer susceptibility to colorectal as well as diffuse gastric cancer.  variability in molecular findings was present for colorectal cancers arising from acquired methylation, as well as those cancers suggestive of a germ line origin.  to determine if the at-risk single-nucleotide polymorphism (snp) alleles for colorectal cancer (crc) could contribute to clinical situations suggestive of an increased genetic risk for crc, we performed a prospective national case-control study based on highly selected patients (crc in two first-degree relatives, one before 61 years of age; or crc diagnosed before 51 years of age; or multiple primary crcs, the first before 61 years of age; exclusion of lynch syndrome and polyposes) and controls without personal or familial history of crc.  the genetics of sporadic and non-syndromic familial colorectal cancer (crc) is not well defined.  not only the tumor genome, but also the germline sequence must be analysed to depict the overall genetic profile, providing potential therapeutic strategies for personalized medicine.  common but weakly penetrant mutations of certain genes may confer an increased susceptibility to colorectal cancer and account for a proportion of 'sporadic' cases.  family history of colorectal cancer is a risk factor for sporadic colorectal cancer, but it is not known which step of the adenoma-carcinoma pathway it influences.  this case control study investigated the relation between family history of cancer and colorectal adenomas and cancers.  the molecular basis for most non-hnpcc familial colorectal cancer cases is unknown, but there is increasing evidence that common genetic variants may play a role.  our results suggest that several colorectal cancer susceptibility snps might also be related to survival by influencing disease progression.  multiple single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) have been associated with colorectal cancer (crc) risk.  a colorectal cancer may develop through a particular molecular genetic pathway, raising the question of whether the particular molecular changes are random, or are unique to the particular segment of colon.  patients with a colorectal cancer (n = 171) had more frequently a family history of cancer, both colorectal (15.8%; p < 0.01) and other cancers (35.7%; p < 0.001) than general population controls (n = 309; fhcrc: 8.1%; fhoc: 21.7%).  epidemiological studies indicate a genetic contribution to colorectal cancer (crc) and colorectal adenoma (cra) risk, but specific genetic variants remain unknown.  colorectal cancer (crc) is a common complex disease caused by the combination of genetic variants and environmental factors.  sporadic colorectal cancer is influenced by numerous single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps), each with minor effects on the cancer risk.  genome-wide association studies (gwas) have identified multiple single-nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) associated with colorectal cancer risk.  several genome wide association studies of colorectal cancer (crc) have identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) on chromosome 15q13.3 associated with crc risk.  to evaluate the potential influence of colorectal cancer susceptibility snps on disease prognosis, we investigated whether gwas-identified colorectal cancer risk snps and polygenic risk scores (prss) might be associated with survival among colorectal cancer patients. ||| ",yes
Have gnotobiotic animal models been used for the study of bowel disease?,"animal models of colitis are widely used to study the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel diseases (ibd) and irritable bowel syndrome (ibs).  the purpose of this review is to summarize the various types of animal models available for use in inflammatory bowel disease research and to illustrate how these models have contributed to a better understanding of the etiopathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease, particularly focusing on papers published during calendar year 1999.  recently, a number of animal models for different aspects of inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) have been developed.  animal models recapitulating features of chronic colitis, such as ulcerative colitis, crohn's disease, or hiv infection, are critical to study disease pathogenesis and test novel therapeutics.  animal model systems have been used extensively to study both experimental and naturally occurring ulcerative colitis syndromes.  animal models are useful for studying disease, but there is a shortage of suitable models of ulcerative colitis.  until recently there existed no appropriate immunological animal models for human inflammatory bowel diseases (ibd).  the availability of new animal models that closely resemble the human disease is expected to allow further characterization of the initiating event(s) in inflammatory bowel disease and lead to a possible cure for this devastating disease.  although there have been numerous attempts to produce inflammatory ulcerative colonic disease in laboratory animals resembling those human disease forms, none has been entirely successful.  animal models are required for research regarding the pathogenesis and efficacy of anti-inflammatory agents in inflammatory bowel disease (ibd).  animal models of experimentally induced inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) are useful for understanding more about the mechanistic basis of disease, identifying new targets for therapeutic intervention, and testing novel therapeutic agents.  using an optimized protocol, dss treatment induces reproducibly typhlocolitis in mongolian gerbils, rendering them as a useful model for ibd.  the h. pylori animal models which have been used in pathogenesis and vaccine studies include the gnotobiotic pig, non-human primates, cats, dogs, and several species of rodents including mice, rats, gerbils and guinea pigs.  the spontaneous colitis models developed in the cotton-top tamarin monkey and the c3h/hejbir mouse mimic more features of human ibd.  murine models of intestinal inflammation have been widely used in biomedical research.  many animal models of ibd can be used to evaluate new anti-inflammatory drugs.  there are many types of colitis models in animals that researchers use to elucidate the mechanism of action of human inflammatory bowel disease (ibd).  rodent models have been developed to study the pathogenesis of diseases caused by helicobacter pylori, as well as by other gastric and intestinal helicobacter spp., but some murine enteric helicobacter spp.  ulcerative colitis and crohn's disease are complex, problematic diseases of unknown etiology in man, and appropriate experimental models would be useful in elucidating their pathogenesis and treatment.  today a number of models, mostly in the mouse and rat, have proved useful in the study of several aspects of ibd, including the histopathology and the disease-inductive and -protective cell types, subsets and cytokines, for example cd4+ t cells, ifn gamma, il-12, il-2, il-10 and tgf beta. ||| ",yes
Have hESC been tested for the treatment of age-related macular degeneration?,"clinical trials using hesc-rpe to treat diseases such as age-related macular degeneration (amd) are currently underway.  several clinical studies have been conducted into the practicality and safety of regenerative therapy using hesc/ipsc-retinal pigment epithelium (rpe) as a treatment for the diseases including age-related macular degeneration.  these results support the use of allogeneic hesc- and ipsc-retina in future clinical application.  these results suggest that hescs could serve as a potentially safe and inexhaustible source of rpe for the efficacious treatment of a range of retinal degenerative diseases.  two important early potential hesc applications are the use of retinal pigment epithelium (rpe) for the treatment of age-related macular degeneration and stargardt disease, an untreatable form of macular dystrophy that leads to early-onset blindness.  a potential application of human embryonic stem cells (hescs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (ipscs) is the generation of retinal pigmented epithelium (rpe) to treat age-related macular degeneration (amd), a common but incurable retinal disease.  esc- and ipsc-derived retinal transplantation is a promising therapeutic approach for disease with end-stage retinal degeneration, such as retinitis pigmentosa and age-related macular degeneration.  human embryonic stem cell-derived retinal pigment epithelial (hesc-rpe) cells could serve as a replacement therapy in advanced stages of age-related macular degeneration.  here we show long-term functional rescue using hesc-derived rpe in both the rcs rat and elov14 mouse, which are animal models of retinal degeneration and stargardt, respectively.  human embryonic stem cells (hescs) are a promising source of retinal pigment epithelium (rpe) cells: cells that can be used for the treatment of common and incurable forms of blindness, such as age-related macular degeneration.  transplantation of human embryonic stem cell (hesc)-derived retinal pigment epithelial (rpe) cells offers the potential for benefit in macular degeneration.  regenerative medicine approaches based on mesenchymal stem cells (mscs) are being investigated to treat several aging-associated diseases, including age-related macular degeneration (amd).  various stem cell types have been tested for their potential application in treating photoreceptor degenerative diseases, such as retinitis pigmentosa (rp) and age-related macular degeneration (amd).  pluripotent stem cell-derived retinal pigment epithelial (rpe) cells are currently being tested for cell replacement in late-stage age-related macular degeneration (amd).  cell replacement is a promising therapy for degenerative diseases like age-related macular degeneration (amd).  assessments of safety and efficacy are crucial before human esc (hesc) therapies can move into the clinic.  stem cells, with their capacity to regenerate and replace diseased tissues, have recently been proposed as having great potential in the treatment of age-related macular degeneration (amd).  here, we characterize the immunological properties of hesc- and ipsc-retina and present their three major advantages: (1) hesc- and ipsc-retina expressed low levels of human leukocyte antigen (hla) class i and little hla class ii in vitro, (2) hesc- and ipsc-retina greatly suppressed immune activation of lymphocytes in co-culture, and (3) hesc- and ipsc-retina suppressed activated immune cells partially via transforming growth factor β signaling.  previous trials have reported improved visual acuity (va), but lacked detailed analysis of retinal structure and function in the treated area.  human embryonic stem cell-derived retinal pigment epithelial cells (hesc-rpe) provide an unlimited cell source for retinal cell replacement therapies. ||| ",yes
Have microRNAs been implicated in pharmacogenomics?,"recent studies suggested that drugs can target micrornas (mirnas) and alter their expression levels.  we propose that mirnas play a central role as a novel regulatory layer affecting drug metabolism and drug targets, and thus should be taken into consideration when conducting pharmacogenomic studies.  epigenetic regulation of gene expression by microrna (mirna) impacts a broad range of cellular processes, but knowledge of its regulation of drug-metabolizing enzymes (dmes) is more limited.  mirnas play a significant role in pharmacogenomics by down-regulating genes that are important for drug function.  we discuss how mirnas, by regulating the expression of pharmacogenomic-related genes, can play a pivotal role in drug efficacy and toxicity and have potential clinical implications for personalized medicine.  micrornas (mirnas) are short noncoding rnas that negatively regulate expression of the majority of animal genes, including many genes involved in drug efficacy.  the incorporation of mirnas into pharmacogenomic research could provide improved insight into drug responses.  recent studies indicate that micrornas (mirnas) play critical roles in human diseases.  experimental evidence for the role of mirnas in regulating pharmacology-related genes and drug responses is increasing.  micro rnas act as a regulatory layer for pharmacogenomics-related gene ex-pression.  recent evidence indicates that mirna variations can affect drug resistance, efficacy, and metabolism, opening new avenues of pharmacogenomics research.  combining chimeric-eclip with passport-seq successfully identified functional mirsnps in pharmacogenes that may affect transcript levels through altered mirna binding.  our method predicts drug-mirna and mirna-disease associations, as intermediate results.  to clarify the regulatory potential of mirnas in pharmacogenomics, we have examined the potential regulation by mirnas of pk and pd genes.  genetic variants affecting mirna binding (mirsnps) have been associated with altered drug response, but previously used methods to identify mirna binding sites and functional mirsnps in pharmacogenes are indirect and limited by low throughput.  here we call for the evaluation of mirnas as an additional regulatory layer affecting pharmacogenomics.  a major discovery is the ability of mirnas to determine the efficacy of drugs, which has given rise to the field of 'mirna pharmacogenomics' through 'pharmaco-mirs'.  here, we developed a mirna-based inference method mirddcr to comprehensively predict drug-disease causal relationships.  to illustrate the potential of mirnas for affecting drug response we performed in silico evaluation of mirna binding regions in genes known to affect drug response.  in our study, the integrated similarities of drugs, mirnas, and diseases were utilized as side information. ||| ",yes
Have mutations in the GARS gene been identified to cause Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease Type 2D (CMT2D)?,"charcot-marie-tooth disease type 2d (cmt2d) is a dominantly inherited peripheral neuropathy caused by missense mutations in the glycyl-trna synthetase gene (gars).  charcot-marie-tooth type 2d neuropathy (cmt2d) is caused by dominant mutations in glycyl trna synthetase (gars).  charcot-marie-tooth disease type 2 (cmt2) is an autosomal dominant axonal neuropathy caused by mutations in various genes.  charcot-marie-tooth disease type 2d, a hereditary axonal neuropathy, is caused by mutations in glycyl-trna synthetase (gars).  charcot-marie-tooth disease type 2 (cmt2) is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous inherited neuropathy.  introduction: charcot-marie-tooth disease type 2a (cmt2a) is a group of clinically and genetically heterogeneous disorders, which is mostly caused by mutations of the mitofusin2 (mfn2) gene.  charcot-marie-tooth disease type 2d (cmt2d) is an autosomal-dominant axonal peripheral neuropathy characterized by impaired motor and sensory function in the distal extremities.  charcot-marie-tooth (cmt) disease type 2 is a genetically heterogeneous group of inherited neuropathies characterized by motor and sensory deficits as a result of peripheral axonal degeneration.  charcot-marie-tooth neuropathy type 2 (cmt2) is a common inherited axonal neuropathy.  glycyl-trna synthetase (gars) gene mutations have been reported to be associated with charcot-marie-tooth disease 2d and distal hereditary motor neuropathy type v (dhmn-v).  mutations in the mfn2 gene have been reported as the primary cause of charcot-marie-tooth disease type 2a.  over 40 mutations in the gdap1 gene have been shown to segregate with charcot-marie-tooth disease (cmt).  mutations in the ganglioside-induced differentiation-associated protein 1 gene (gdap1) cause charcot-marie-tooth type 2 (cmt2), a severe autosomal recessive form of neuropathy associated with axonal phenotypes.  we confirmed a significant role of mutations in mfn2 in the pathogenesis of charcot-marie-tooth disease type 2.  the mechanism by which dominantly inherited mutations in the housekeeping gene gars, which encodes glycyl-trna synthetase (glyrs), mediate selective peripheral nerve toxicity resulting in charcot-marie-tooth disease type 2d (cmt2d) is still largely unresolved.  mutations in the glycyl-trna synthetase (gars) gene cause cmt2d.  charcot-marie-tooth disease type 2d (cmt2d) is a peripheral nerve disorder caused by dominant, toxic, gain-of-function mutations in the widely expressed, housekeeping gene, gars the mechanisms underlying selective nerve pathology in cmt2d remain unresolved, as does the cause of the mild-to-moderate sensory involvement that distinguishes cmt2d from the allelic disorder distal spinal muscular atrophy type v. to elucidate the mechanism responsible for the underlying afferent nerve pathology, we examined the sensory nervous system of cmt2d mice.  charcot-marie-tooth disease type 2d (cmt2d) and distal spinal muscular atrophy type v (dsma-v) are axonal peripheral neuropathies inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion.  charcot-marie-tooth disease (cmt) refers to a genetically heterogeneous group of disorders which cause a peripheral motor and sensory neuropathy.  our results demonstrate that impaired function is a common characteristic of cmt-associated gars mutations. ||| ",yes
Have mutations in the Polycomb group been found in human diseases?,"the polycomb group proteins have recently captured the attention of cancer biologists.  later, a group of diverse genes collectively called polycomb group (pcg) genes were identified based on common mutant phenotypes.  polycomb group genes (pcgs) are epigenetic effectors implicated in most cancer hallmarks.  polycomb group (pcg) proteins are conserved epigenetic regulators that are linked to cancer in humans.  although the abnormal expression of polycomb-group (pcg) proteins is closely associated with carcinogenesis and the clinicopathological features of hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc), the genetic mutation profile of pcg genes has not been well established.  more than 80 years ago, the first polycomb-related phenotype was identified in drosophila melanogaster.  the polycomb gene was discovered 60 years ago as a mutation inducing a particular homeotic phenotype.  mutations and deletions of polycomb repressive complex (prc) components are increasingly recognized to affect tumor biology in a range of cancers.  polycomb group (pcg) proteins, which are conserved from invertebrates to mammals, are associated with epigenetic regulation of many cell fates.  overexpression of polycomb group proteins is associated with poor prognoses in some types of cancers but with favorable prognoses in others.  subsequent work showed that polycomb is a general repressor of homeotic genes.  naturally occurring variations of polycomb repressive complex 1 (prc1) comprise a core assembly of polycomb group proteins and additional factors that include, surprisingly, autism susceptibility candidate 2 (auts2).  polycomb group proteins are epigenetic factors that silence gene expression; they are dysregulated in cancer cells and contribute to carcinogenesis by unclear mechanisms.  polycomb group proteins form multicomponent complexes that are important for establishing lineage-specific patterns of gene expression.  other genes with similar function were identified and named polycomb group (pcg) genes, while trithorax group (trxg) genes were shown to counteract pcg-mediated repression of homeotic genes.  mutations in several polycomb (pc) group genes cause maternal-effect or zygotic segmentation defects, suggesting that pc group genes may regulate the segmentation genes of drosophila.  our results provide evidence that cbfβ-smmhc markedly and diversely affects polycomb recruitment and transcriptional regulation across the aml genome.  however, little is known about how genetic alterations of prc-interacting molecules such as the core binding factor (cbf) complex influence polycomb activity.  some polyposis syndromes have been known for decades, but the development in genetic technologies has allowed the identification of new syndromes..  mammalian cells encode multiple permutations of the prototypic polycomb repressive complex 1 (prc1) with little evidence for functional specialization. ||| ",yes
Have mutations in the ZEB2 gene been found in any human syndrome?,"over 180 distinct mutations in zeb2 have been reported, including nonsense and missense point mutations, deletions, and large chromosomal rearrangements.  it is caused by haploinsufficiency of the zeb2 gene in chromosome 2q22.3.  more recently, de novo mutations of zbtb18 have been identified in patients with syndromic and non-syndromic intellectual disability.  this is the first report of a partial duplication of the zeb2 gene resulting in mowat-wilson syndrome.  chromosomal microarray identified a novel de novo 69-kb duplication containing exons 1 and 2 of the zeb2 gene.  here we collect and summarize all available mutations in the human zic2 gene detected in hpe patients (21 published and 62 novel).  moreover, we hypothesize that nonsense mutations of zbtb18 are associated with a more severe phenotype than missense mutations.  genetic variation of the multi-zinc finger btb domain transcription factor zbtb18 can cause a spectrum of human neurodevelopmental disorders, but the underlying mechanisms are not well understood.  our results demonstrate that general population variants, while rare, can influence zbtb18 function, with potential consequences for neurodevelopment, homeostasis, and disease.  recently, we reported that pathogenic, de novo zbtb18 missense mutations alter its dna-binding specificity and gene regulatory functions, leading to human neurodevelopmental disease.  a total of 157 individuals from 119 unrelated kindreds are described, including 141 patients with intragenic sequence determined mutations in zic2.  by direct sequencing of dna samples of an unselected group of unrelated patients with hpe in our nih laboratory, zic2 mutations were found in 8.4% (49/582) of probands.  we report on a patient with a de novo zbtb18 nonsense mutation and a de novo 15q13.3 microdeletion, both in a heterozygous state, identified by next generation sequencing and array-cgh.  to characterise genetic and clinical findings in patients with zic2 mutations.  here, we investigated such variants documented in the genome aggregation database (gnomad) to discover that zbtb gene family members are intolerant to loss-of-function and missense mutations, but not synonymous mutations.  a homozygous frameshift mutation (c.231_232del) in zswim7 was found in two out of the 60 unrelated noa patients.  recent studies have shown that zbed3 is associated with insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus.  all zbtb24 mutations reported in icf patients are predicted to disrupt at least one zf motif.  zbtb18 has been proposed as candidate gene for microcephaly and abnormalities of the corpus callosum based on overlapping microdeletions of 1q43q44.  clinical details were examined and all other known cases of mutations in zic2 were included through a literature search. ||| ",yes
Have studies shown that there is no link between DNA methylation patterns and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder?,"few studies have explored interactions between genes and social environmental exposures (gxses) for trauma-related psychopathology, including symptoms of posttraumatic stress (pts) and major depression (md).  disasters are associated with increased risk of posttraumatic stress disorder (ptsd) and major depression, but no study, to the authors' knowledge, has determined whether genotype interacts with disaster exposure and social support to moderate risk of these phenotypes.  controlled studies examining the relationship between psychiatric disorders and war and other traumatic events are reviewed.  findings underscore the role of traumatic stress-related interference and self-medication in the development of mdd.  relatively few studies have examined prevalence and predictors of posttraumatic stress disorder (ptsd) or major depressive episode (mde) in disaster-affected adolescents.  several studies have found a correlation between the severity of posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms and the degree of trauma.  our results confirm that the risk of depression conferred by childhood maltreatment is modified by variation at both sert and bdnf genes.  despite accumulated evidence linking trauma exposure to major depressive disorder (mdd), there is limited understanding as to why some trauma survivors subsequently develop mdd.  to date, studies of biological risk factors have revealed inconsistent relationships with subsequent post-traumatic stress disorder (ptsd).  no relationship has been found between trauma and subsequent violent behavior.  research to date has not examined how childhood sexual trauma (cst) followed by sexual trauma during military service (mst) relates to posttraumatic stress disorder (ptsd), depression, and suicidality among women and men.  posttraumatic stress disorder (ptsd) is associated with altered concentrations of stress-related neurohormones, neurotrophins, and neuropeptides in plasma and serum; however, few studies have examined central alterations of these measures in individuals with ptsd.  our study aimed to clarify whether, in the presence of previous childhood maltreatment, individuals carrying low functional alleles for both sert 5-httlpr and bdnf val66met polymorphisms had a higher risk for md.  the evidence supports a risk-modifying effect of traumatic brain injury in individuals who are genetically at risk for schizophrenia, but is less supportive of traumatic brain injury as an independent risk factor for schizophrenia in individuals without such risk.  however, it is unknown whether this gene-environment interaction is present for recurrent depressive disorder and different forms of maltreatment.  there is inconsistent evidence of interaction between stressful events and a serotonin transporter promoter polymorphism (5-httlpr) in depression.  the aim of the study is to replicate a recent study which provided preliminary evidence of interaction between severity of childhood maltreatment and the 5-httlpr polymorphism in recurrent mdd.  there is limited evidence for a moderating role of both serotonin transporter (sert) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (bdnf) genes on the risk for major depression (md) developing after childhood maltreatment.  the low-expression variant of the 5-httlpr polymorphism modifies risk of postdisaster ptsd and major depression under conditions of high hurricane exposure and low social support, confirming and extending previous research.  it is hypothesized that genetic sensitivity to stress could be more specific to recurrent major depressive disorder (mdd). ||| ",no
Have the promoter regions of the genes implicated in Rett Syndrome been characterized with CAGE?,"several genes have been implicated in rett syndrome (rtt) in its typical and variant forms.  mutations in this gene have been associated with rett syndrome, a form of autism.  a whole x chromosome study of families in which rett syndrome had been diagnosed in more than one member indicated that the region between xq27 and xqter was the most likely region to harbour a gene which may be involved in the aetiology of the disease.  rett syndrome (rtt) is an autism spectrum disorder caused by mutations in the x-linked gene encoding methyl-cpg binding protein 2 (mecp2).  the systematic screening of rett syndrome (rtt) patients for pathogenetic sequence variations has focused on three genes that have been associated with rtt or related clinical phenotypes, namely mecp2, cdkl5, and foxg1.  the x-linked neurological disorder rett syndrome (rtt) presents with autistic features and is caused primarily by mutations in a transcriptional regulator, methyl cpg-binding protein 2 (mecp2).  thirty-nine patients with classical rett syndrome, one with preserved speech variant (psv), and 12 patients with developmental delay and some features of rett syndrome were recruited for sequence analysis of the mecp2 gene coding region.  rett syndrome (rtt) is caused by mutations in the gene encoding methyl-cpg binding protein 2 (mecp2), an epigenetic regulator of mrna transcription.  rett syndrome (rtt) is caused by mutations in methyl-cpg-binding protein 2 (mecp2), but defects in a handful of other genes (e.g., cdkl5, foxg1, mef2c) can lead to presentations that resemble, but do not completely mirror, classical rtt.  a rett syndrome mutation with decreased protein expression was found to be associated with a conserved g-quadruplex.  furthermore, it has been demonstrated that rett syndrome, which is categorized into pervasive developmental disorders the same as the autism spectrum disorders are, is associated with mutations in mecp2 gene.  mutations in the coding sequence of the methyl-cpg-binding protein 2 gene (mecp2), which cause rett syndrome (rtt), have been found in male and female autistic subjects without, however, a causal relation having unequivocally been established.  rett syndrome and angelman syndrome are two neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by partial overlapping features.  an mecp2 mutation can be found in almost every patient with classical rett syndrome.  mutations in the gene coding for methyl-cpg-binding protein 2 (mecp2) cause rett syndrome (rtt) and have also been reported in a number of x-linked mental retardation syndromes.  found in 100% of the patients with classical rett syndrome originating from finland.  to evaluate whether environmental factors may influence the disease outcome of rett syndrome, we tested the effect of environmental enrichment from 4 weeks of age on the behavioural competence of mutant mice harboring a mecp2 (tm1tam)-null allele.  mutations in the coding region of the methyl-cpg-binding protein 2 ( mecp2) gene cause rett syndrome and have also been reported in a number of x-linked mental retardation syndromes.  we applied next-generation sequencing (ngs) to evaluate for mutations in known or new candidate genes in patients with variant forms of rett or rett-like phenotypes of unknown molecular aetiology.  the neuropathology of the rett syndrome is summarized utilizing a format of clinical pathological correlations, describing the pathology at specific anatomic sites which could correlate with the well defined clinical signs and symptoms in the rett syndrome; decreased head and body size, autism, gait dysfunction, spasticity, movement and breathing disorder. ||| ",yes
Have thyronamines  effects on fat tissue?,"differentiation and metabolism of adipose tissue are modulated by thyroid hormones (ths), but relatively little is known about the metabolism of ths in this tissue.  increased lipid mobilization in thyrotoxicosis is attributed to amplification of catecholamine action in fat cells by thyroid hormones.  thyrotropin receptor (tshr) in extrathyroidal tissue, especially fat tissue, is supposed to have important roles in the development of extrathyroidal manifestations of graves' disease.  although tsh is the main regulator of thyroid growth and function, tsh binding activity in fat has long been reported.  our results document increased d1 gene expression and activity in adipose tissue of obese humans and suggest a role of 3,5,3'-triiodo-l-thyronine formed by d1 in response to leptin in the modulation of adipose tissue metabolism.  this study aimed to explore the relationship between abdominal fat distribution and free triiodothyronine (ft3) and ft3 to free thyroxine (ft4) ratio (ft3/ft4) in a euthyroid population.  in adipose tissue, changes in thyroid status result in alterations of lipolytic capacity.  in both subcutaneous and visceral fat, the thyroid gene expression (especially tshr) is reduced in obesity.  however, while it is unclear what the effects are of calorie restriction and high doses of triiodothyronine (t(3)) on adipokines in obesity, thyroid hormones are illicitly administered in isolation or in association with a hypocaloric diet as an obesity treatment.  thyroid hormones regulate energy balance and act on adipokines.  since the tsh receptor (tshr) has been detected in both preadipocytes and adipocytes, we hypothesized that it may play a role in adipose differentiation.  thyrotropin receptor (tsh-r) has been thought to be thyroid-specific, but, by northern blot analysis, we found that rat adipose tissue expressed tsh-r mrnas in amounts approaching those in the thyroid.  to investigate the influence of thyroid hormone status on adipose tshr expression, we induced hyper- and hypothyroidism in balbc mice by administering tri-iodothyronine and propylthiouracil respectively.  the objective of this study was to measure the expression of the tsh receptor (tshr) and the thyroid hormone receptor (tralpha1) genes in subcutaneous adipose tissue (sat) and visceral adipose tissue (vat) in obese individuals and to test the effect of weight loss on these genes.  in the present study, we investigated the effect of triiodothyronine (t3) on the expression of adiponectin mrna and the release of leptin and adiponectin by white adipose tissue (wat) explants obtained from epididymal (visceral) or inguinal (subcutaneous) depots from normal rats.  to determine whether tsh impacts adipogenesis, we examined how adipocytes responded to tsh at various points during their differentiation from cultured es cells.  thyroid hormones are key regulators of metabolism.  although thyroid hormones influence adipocyte metabolism, nt3bs have not been described in mature adipocytes yet.  the reversal of these changes with major weight loss and the reciprocal changes in plasma tsh and ft(3) levels suggest a role for adipocytes in the regulation of tsh and thyroid hormones.  this study examined whether tsh has direct effects on peripheral th metabolism and serum lipids. ||| ",no

Is  farnesoid X receptor (FXR) a nuclear receptor?,"the farnesoid x receptor (fxr) is a ligand-activated transcription factor belonging to the nuclear receptor (nr) superfamily.  farnesoid x receptor (fxr) is a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily of ligand-activated transcription factors.  farnesoid x receptor (fxr, nr1h4) is a ligand-activated transcription factor, belonging to the nuclear receptor superfamily.  farnesoid x receptor (fxr, nr1h4) is a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily of ligand-activated transcription factors.  farnesoid x receptor (fxr) is a member of nuclear receptor family involved in multiple physiological processes through regulating specific target genes.  farnesoid x receptor (fxr) belongs to the group of nuclear receptors (nrs), which regulate the expression of various genes by binding to dna either as a monomer or a heterodimer with retinoid x receptor.  the farnesoid x receptor (fxr) is a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily that is highly expressed in liver, kidney, adrenals, and intestine.  the farnesoid x receptor (fxr) is a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily that is highly expressed in liver, kidney, adrenals, and intestine.  the farnesoid x receptor (fxr, nr1h4) belongs to the nuclear receptor superfamily and is activated by bile acids such as chenodeoxycholic acid, or synthetic ligands such as gw4064.  the farnesoid x-activated receptor (fxr; nr1h4) is a member of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily and functions as a heterodimer with the 9-cis-retinoic acid receptor (rxr).  farnesoid x receptor (fxr, nr1h4) is a ligand-activated nuclear receptor, which regulates bile acid, lipid and glucose metabolism.  the farnesoid x receptor (fxr; nr1h4) is a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily and regulates the expression of genes involved in enterohepatic circulation and the metabolism of bile acids.  farnesol x receptor (fxr) is a member of the metabolic nuclear receptor (nr) superfamily of regulatory proteins.  the farnesoid x receptor (fxr) is a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily of ligand-activated transcription factors, which plays crucial role in bile acid, cholesterol, lipid and glucose metabolism, as well as in the development of atherosclerosis, intestinal bacterial growth and liver regeneration.  the nuclear receptor farnesoid x receptor (fxr) is a critical regulator of multiple genes involved in bile acid homeostasis.  the farnesoid x receptor (fxr) has recently become a potential therapeutical target.  farnesoid x receptor (fxr), the receptor for bile acids, including chenodeoxycholic acid (cdca), is a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily, which also includes the receptors for retinoic acid, vitamin d (d3), thyroid hormone, thiazolidinedione and 22(r)-hydroxycholesterol.  the farnesoid x-activated receptor (fxr; nr1h4), a member of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily, induces gene expression in response to several bile acids, including chenodeoxycholic acid.  fxr is a ligand-dependent transcription factor belonging to the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily.  among these receptors, the farnesoid x-activated receptor (fxr) has recently been identified as one activated by bile acids and farnesol. ||| ",yes
Is ABCE1 involved in ribosomal recycling?,"the atp-binding cassette (abc) protein abce1 is an essential factor in ribosome recycling during translation.  the data demonstrate that the ribosomal stalk protein likely participates in efficient actions of both archaeal and eukaryotic abce1 in ribosome recycling.  the abce1 atpase, a unique abc superfamily member that bears two fe₄s₄ clusters, is crucial for ribosomal biogenesis and recycling.  ribosome recycling orchestrated by abce1 is a fundamental process in protein translation and mrna surveillance, connecting termination with initiation.  to study the function of rli1/abce1 in vivo, we used ribosome profiling and biochemistry to characterize its contribution to ribosome recycling.  recent studies have identified abce1 as a ribosome-recycling factor important for translation termination in mammalian cells, yeast and also archaea.  here, we define how allosterically coupled atp binding and hydrolysis events in abce1 empower ribosome recycling.  based on these data, we propose a refined model of how signals from the ribosome are integrated into the atpase cycle of abce1 to orchestrate ribosome recycling.  here, we reveal the ancestral role and mechanistic principles of the newly identified twin-atpase abce1 in ribosome recycling.  ribosome recycling by the twin-atpase abce1 is a key regulatory process in mrna translation and surveillance and in ribosome-associated protein quality control in eukarya and archaea.  by direct (11) interaction, the peptide release factor arf1 is shown to synergistically promote abce1 function in posttermination ribosome recycling.  ribosome recycling orchestrated by the atp binding cassette (abc) protein abce1 can be considered as the final-or the first-step within the cyclic process of protein synthesis, connecting translation termination and mrna surveillance with re-initiation.  atp-binding cassette sub-family e member 1 (abce1) is recognized as a strongly conserved ribosome recycling factor, indispensable for translation in archaea and eukaryotes, however, its role in plants remains largely unidentified.  the twin-atpase abce1 has a vital function in mrna translation by recycling terminated or stalled ribosomes.  because of its fundamental role in translation initiation and/or ribosome biosynthesis, abce1 is essential for life.  the structure reveals the dynamic behavior of structural motifs unique to abce1, which ultimately leads to ribosome splitting.  the abc protein abce1, formerly named rnase l inhibitor rli1, is one of the most conserved proteins in evolution and is expressed in all organisms except eubacteria.  meaningfully, the observed structural requirements of atabce2 for rna silencing suppression were found to be similar to those of archaeal abce1 needed for ribosome recycling.  the key role of abce1, and what is known about the structure and function of this versatile protein, is discussed.  atabce2 might therefore suppress rna silencing via supporting the competing rna degradation mechanisms associated with ribosome recycling. ||| ",yes
Is ACI-35 a passive vaccine?,"adenovirus serotype 35 (ad35) is a promising vaccine platform for human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) infection and emerging infectious diseases as it is uncommon in humans worldwide and is distinct from ad5, the major vaccine serotype for which many individuals have pre-existing immunity.  these findings support the further development of ad35 as a vaccine vector, and promote vaccine regimens that utilize serial administration of heterologous adenoviruses.  therefore, rad35 is being investigated as a vaccine carrier for a number of diseases for which an effective vaccine is needed, including malaria, aids and tuberculosis.  recombinant adenovirus (ad) type 35 (rad35) shows great promise as vaccine carrier with the advantage of low pre-existing immunity in human populations, in contrast to the more commonly used rad5 vector.  replication-incompetent adenovirus type 35 (rad35) represents a potent vaccine carrier that elicits strong, antigen-specific t- and b-cell responses in diverse preclinical models.  here we describe an adult female patient who was vaccinated with an as03 adjuvanted split-virus vaccine injected into the left arm.  aeras-402/ad35.tb-s was well tolerated, safe and induced predominantly polyfunctional cd4(+) and cd8(+) t-cell responses to vaccine.  the immunogenicity of a first-generation, replication-competent ad35-based vaccine was tested in the simian immunodeficiency virus (siv) rhesus macaque model by evaluating its capacity to boost immunity generated by ad5-based vectors.  in the recent pandemic influenza a-(h1n1) v-2009 vaccination campaign, adjuvanted vaccines have been used because of their antigen-sparing effect.  aeras-402/ad35.tb-s induced strong ag85a and ag85b specific antibody responses, particularly after the second vaccination.  subsequent immunization with ad5-based vectors was minimally effective, whereas immunization with ad35-based vectors generated a strong increase in the frequency of gag-specific t cells with specificities that were unchanged.  we assessed the immune response and safety of as03-adjuvanted a/california/7/2009 h1n1 pandemic vaccine containing half of the registered adult haemagglutinin (ha) antigen content, administered as a two-dose schedule at intervals of 21 days or 6 months in both young and elderly adults.  the safety and immunogenicity of a replication deficient adenovirus serotype 35 tuberculosis (tb) vaccine containing gene inserts for antigens (ag) 85a, ag85b and tb10.4 (aeras-402/ad35.tb-s) was evaluated in previously bcg vaccinated, hiv-infected south african adults with baseline cd4 counts >350 cells/mm(3).  the results indicate that flexibility in the dosing interval for as03a adjuvanted vaccine may be possible.  the potential of passive immunisation for the treatment of existing rsv infections is not clear.  robust immune responses were seen in crs vaccinated with ad5.rsv-f given i.m.  such rad35 vectors thus expand the utility of rad35 vaccine carriers for the development of vaccines against, for example, malaria, aids and tuberculosis.  a 23-valent unconjugated pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (23vp), routinely administered at the age of 65, has limited effectiveness, and revaccination induces attenuated antibody responses.  it is not known whether pneumococcal polysaccharide-protein conjugated vaccines (pcv), although highly effective in infants, offer any immunological advantages over 23vp in adults.  passive immunisation with antibody to rsv has been found to be an effective alternative method for prophylaxis. ||| ",no
Is Achondroplasia associated with hearing loss?,"adults with achondroplasia are at increased risk of early hearing loss.  this population-based study investigated the prevalence, severity, and type of hearing loss in norwegian adults with achondroplasia.  recurrent otitis media infections, chronic middle ear effusion, and hearing loss are common in children with achondroplasia, but few studies have investigated hearing loss in adults with this condition.  we present a patient with achondroplasia who presented with hearing loss and was referred to radiology for temporal bone imaging.  authors experienced a case of an achondroplastic patient with bilateral hearing disturbance.  our findings underline the importance of a regular hearing assessment being part of standard care in achondroplasia, including adolescents and young adults.  temporal bone and middle ear structures are distorted in achondroplasia because of rotational change of the skull base.  achondroplasia is a genetic condition caused by disordered endochondral ossification, which leads to rhizomelic dwarfism and midfacial hypoplasia.  we collected data on 45 adults with genetically confirmed achondroplasia: 23 men and 22 women, aged 16-70 years.  previous studies of this disorder have identified a significant incidence of associated hearing loss.  potential medical complications associated with achondroplasia include lower extremity long bone bowing, middle-ear dysfunction, obstructive sleep apnea, and, more rarely, cervicomedullary compression, hydrocephalus, thoracolumbar kyphosis, and central sleep apnea.  high-resolution computed tomography of temporal bones demonstrated several interesting morphological abnormalities characteristic of achondroplasia.  achondroplasia is the most common skeletal dysplasia and it combines various complications with normal longevity.  audiovestibular dysfunction is encountered in as and sensorineural hearing loss is the most common form.  otosclerosis is a frequent cause of deafness in adults.  cochlear nerve aplasia or hypoplasia is found in up to a half of patients with unilateral or bilateral hearing loss.  achondroplasia is the most common short-stature skeletal dysplasia, additionally marked by rhizomelia, macrocephaly, midface hypoplasia, and normal cognition.  hearing loss is a common sensory deficit in humans.  additionally, we aimed to determine if audiological outcomes differed in children with aplasia from those with hypoplasia.  achondroplasia is the most common form of disproportionate skeletal dysplasia. ||| ",yes
Is Alpers disease inherited in an autosomal recessive mode?,"alpers-huttenlocher syndrome (ahs) is a very rare autosomal recessive disorder.  alström syndrome has an autosomal recessive nature of inheritance.  these results indicate that the protein abnormality in autosomal dominant alport syndrome does not produce the retinopathy and lenticonus typical of x-linked and autosomal recessive disease.  we have examined the eyes in the members of two families where alport syndrome was diagnosed on the basis of the clinical features and family history, and where autosomal dominant inheritance was confirmed by father-to-son disease transmission, the associated haematological abnormalities, and haplotypes that segregated with the recently described locus at chromosome 22q.  autosomal recessive inheritance is increased in females with alport syndrome and early onset renal failure, hearing loss, lenticonus, and, possibly, central retinopathy.  this study determined the family history and clinical features that suggested autosomal recessive rather than x-linked alport syndrome.  fifteen percent of patients with alport syndrome have autosomal recessive inheritance caused by two pathogenic mutations in either col4a3 or col4a4.  alport syndrome (as) is genetically heterogeneous.  most patients with alport syndrome have x-linked or autosomal recessive disease that is characterised by renal failure, hearing loss, and, in nearly 75% of the cases, a dot-and-fleck retinopathy and anterior lenticonus.  alport's syndrome is a heterogeneous disorder made up of a number of genetically distinct syndromes, with an autosomal dominant, an x-linked dominant and a rare autosomal recessive form.  an autosomal dominant variety of alport syndrome also exists, but mutations in this form of the disease have not yet been described.  most families with as show an x-linked dominant pattern of inheritance but about 15% of families show an autosomal inheritance of the disease.  we have examined the eyes of a family with autosomal recessive alport syndrome.  fourteen (93 %) individuals with autosomal recessive alport syndrome developed early end-stage renal failure, all 15 had hearing loss, and most had lenticonus (12, 80 %), and a central (13, 87 %) or peripheral (13, 87 %) retinopathy.  genetic heterogeneity is a well-known feature of alport syndrome (as).  autosomal recessive alport syndrome is suspected in consanguineous families and when female patients develop renal failure.  in conclusion, patient phenotypes may vary depending on the underlying mutations, and genetic testing should be considered for the routine diagnosis of autosomal recessive alport syndrome.  alport syndrome (as) is a genetically heterogeneous hereditary renal disease.  autosomal dominant alport syndrome is caused by a mutation in the gene encoding type iv collagen α3 (α3); (col4a3), or α4 (α4); (col4a4).  the mode of inheritance of alport syndrome (ats) has long been controversial. ||| ",yes
Is Alu hypomethylation associated with breast cancer?,"these findings suggest that leukocyte dna hypomethylation is independently associated with development of breast cancer.  distant metastatic dtc, pdtc, and atc were increasingly affected by global alu hypomethylation, suggesting that this epigenetic entity may be involved in thyroid cancer progression and dedifferentiation.  alu hypomethylation was similar between distant metastases and matched primary tumors.  global dna hypomethylation may result in chromosomal instability and oncogene activation, and as a surrogate of systemic methylation activity, may be associated with breast cancer risk.  within distant metastatic dtc, alu hypomethylation was increased in braf vs ras mutated tumors.  the median alu methylation level in tumor samples was 40.30 % (iqr, 36.80-54.20 %), which shows the correlation of alu hypomethylation between tumor and serum samples (r = 0.882) in the study group.  global genomic hypomethylation is a hallmark of cancer in humans.  in the present study, the feasibility of measuring hypomethylation of alu elements (alu) in serum and its clinical utility were investigated.  tumor tissues and matched serum specimens from 65 glioma patients and serum samples from 30 healthy controls were examined for alu hypomethylation by bisulfite sequencing.  therefore, as opposed to other cancer types, widespread hypomethylation and regional hypermethylation do not appear to be involved in the early stages of breast cancer and does not account for the molecular heterogeneity of the disease.  our results indicate that the detection of alu hypomethylation in serum may be clinically useful for the diagnosis and prognosis of glioma.  genome-wide dna hypomethylation is an early event in the carcinogenic process.  global dna hypomethylation is a major event for the development and progression of cancer, although the significance in thyroid cancer remains unclear.  kaplan-meier and cox regression analyses showed that thyroid cancer-related and all-cause mortality were associated with tumor hypomethylation, but this association was lost after adjustment for thyroid cancer risk category.  widespread hypomethylation of dna and regional hypermethylation, including tumor suppressor regions, have been demonstrated in several human cancers.  global hypomethylation of alu repeats was used as a surrogate marker for dna global hypomethylation, and was assessed using the quantification of unmethylated alu technique.  aberrant dna methylation has been recognized to contribute to breast carcinogenesis, and promoter hypermethylation of several tumor suppressor genes has been correlated with decreased gene expression.  an increasing hypomethylation was found for distant metastatic dtc  and pdtc/atc (median, 9.3; iqr, 7.0 to 12.1) as compared with normal thyroid tissue (median, 2.75; iqr, 2.30 to 3.15), whereas low-risk and pediatric dtc were not affected by hypomethylation.  hypomethylation of line-1 elements has emerged as a distinguishing feature in human cancers.  however, low methionine intake appeared more likely to be associated with tumors with unknown methylation status and high level of alcohol consumption seemed more likely to be related to tumors with un-methylated genes. ||| ",yes
Is Annexin V an apoptotic marker?,"annexin v is a ca(++)-binding protein which is widely used as a marker for apoptotic cells, as it binds to the phosphatidylserine residues exposed at the surface of apoptotic cells.  annexin v can be used to detect apoptotic cells in vitro and in vivo, based on its ability to identify extracellular phosphatidylserine, which arises during apoptosis.  annexin v is useful in detecting apoptotic cells by binding to phosphatidylserine (ps) that is exposed on the outer surface of the cell membrane during apoptosis.  annexin v is of crucial importance for detection of the phosphatidylserine of apoptotic cell membranes.  radiolabeled annexin v has been proposed to be a promising candidate for detecting apoptotic cells in tumors following chemotherapy in vivo.  radiolabeled annexin v is used for imaging apoptosis.  because annexin v has a high affinity for exposed phosphatidylserine on apoptotic cells, radiolabeled annexin v may be used for noninvasive detection of apoptosis in atherosclerotic lesions.  annexin-v is a calcium-dependent protein that binds with high affinity to phosphaditylserine exposed during apoptosis.  in this paper, we report a new class of annexin v-based probes for apoptosis.  finally, two methods are described in which a fluorescently labeled derivative of annexin v is used to detect apoptosis, namely the in vitro method of fluorescence-activated cell sorting (facs) where fluorescent annexin v is used to differentiate apoptotic and necrotic cells within a population; and detection of apoptosing retinal cells (darc) allowing the identification of apoptotic cells in the retina in vivo.  annexin v and propidium iodide staining is widely used for determining the cellular death through apoptosis.  annexin v is a protein that binds to phosphatidylserine exposed on dying cells.  the ca(2+)-dependent binding of annexin v to phosphatidylserine on cell surfaces is a reliable marker for apoptosis that is widely used in flow cytometry based apoptosis assays.  it is reported that urinary annexin v concentration may be an indicator of apoptosis and acute renal injury related to the urinary protein level.  annexin v, a human protein with a high affinity for phosphatidylserine, has been labeled with (99m)tc to detect apoptosis in vivo.  annexin v (annexin a5), a human protein with a high affinity for phosphatidylserine, labeled with (99m)tc can detect apoptosis in vivo.  annexin v recognizes apoptotic cells by specific molecular interaction with phosphatidyl serine, a lipid that is normally sequestered in the inner leaflet of the cell membrane, but is translocated to the outer leaflet in apoptotic cells, such as foam cells of atherosclerotic plaque.  annexin v accumulated in the infarct area of the left ventricle, where apoptotic cells were observed.  at electron microscopy, gold-labeling of annexin v was located on the plasma membrane only of apoptotic thymocytes and on cytoplasmic debris, likely resulting from the typical apoptotic blebbing.  annexin v has a molecular weight of 32-35 kda and has been reported to possess anticoagulant activity, inhibition of phospholipase a(2), regulation of membrane transport, proliferation and signal transduction. ||| ",yes
Is Apremilast effective for Behcet’s syndrome?,"to determine the real-world short-term efficacy and safety of apremilast for behçet's disease (bd).  in a phase 2 trial involving patients with behçet's syndrome, apremilast reduced the incidence and severity of oral ulcers.  data on the efficacy and safety of apremilast in patients with behçet's syndrome who had active oral ulcers and had not previously received biologic agents are limited.  the small-molecule phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitor apremilast modulates cytokines that are up-regulated in behçet's syndrome.  in patients with oral ulcers associated with behçet's syndrome, apremilast resulted in a greater reduction in the number of oral ulcers than placebo but was associated with adverse events, including diarrhea, nausea, and headache.  in a phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, patients who had behçet's syndrome with active oral ulcers but no major organ involvement to receive either apremilast at a dose of 30 mg or placebo, administered orally, twice daily for 12 weeks, followed by a 52-week extension phase.  randomized controlled data is available for behçet's disease, hidradenitis suppurativa, nail/scalp/palmoplantar psoriasis, alopecia areata, and atopic dermatitis.conclusion: the relatively safe adverse effect profile of apremilast and its broad immunomodulatory characteristics may make it a promising option in the future for patients with difficult to treat diseases in dermatology, refractory to first line therapies, but further studies will be necessary to clarify its role.  there is an increasing interest in the treatment of refractory mucocutaneous symptoms of behçet's disease, and results were quite promising with apremilast, anakinra, and ustekinumab.  to assess the efficacy of apremilast, behçet's disease current activity form (bdcaf) and patients' self-perception of their disease activity were monitored for three months.  apremilast is an oral, selective small molecule inhibitor of phosphodiesterase-4 (pde4) that has been approved for the treatment of active psoriatic arthritis, moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, and for patients with oral ulcers associated with behçet's disease.  apremilast, an oral small molecule inhibitor of phosphodiesterase 4 (pde4), is in development for chronic inflammatory disorders, and has shown efficacy in psoriasis, psoriatic arthropathies, and behçet's syndrome.  apremilast is a small-molecule biologic approved by the us food and drug administration (fda) for use in plaque psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, and behçet disease.  these findings suggest a potential role for apremilast in the treatment of atherosclerosis.  in conclusion, orally administered apremilast is an effective, generally well tolerated and convenient option for the treatment of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis.  enthesitis, dactylitis, physical function and fatigue were also improved with apremilast, and its efficacy was sustained for up to 208 weeks.  apremilast (otezla®) is an oral small molecule phosphodiesterase 4 (pde4) inhibitor approved for the treatment of psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, and oral ulcers associated with behçet's disease.  current treatment modalities in behçet's disease will be summarized in light of new studies published within the last 2 years.  the tnf-blocker adalimumab can be effective in behçet's disease (bd), a multisystem auto-inflammatory disorder.  apremilast, an oral phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor, has demonstrated efficacy in patients with moderate to severe psoriasis.  significant improvement in oral ulcer and bdcaf with apremilast was confirmed in real-world bd patients after 3 months. ||| ",yes
Is Beta-Thalassemia is associated with a mutation or deletion of the gene that codes for alpha globin?,"alpha-thalassemia (α-thal) is a disorder caused by the deletion of single or double α-globin genes, and/or point mutations in the α-globin genes.  unlike beta-thalassemia, in which non-deletional mutations predominate, most of recognized alpha-thalassemia mutations include deletion of one or both alpha-globin genes.  alpha thalassemia is a genetic disorder of hemoglobin production that typically is inherited in an autosomal co-dominant fashion.  alpha-thalassemia and beta-thalassemia, respectively.  thalassemias are a group of inherited autosomal recessive hematologic disorders that occur because of defects in the alpha (α)- and beta (β)-globin genes of adult hemoglobin (hb).  introduction: alpha- and beta-thalassemia are caused by reduced or absent synthesis of hemoglobin (hb) subunits α and/or β. hba2, hba1, and hbb mutations are the main cause of thalassemias.  thalassemia is a heritable human anemia caused by a variety of mutations that affect expression of the alpha- or the beta-chain of hemoglobin.  alpha and beta-thalassemia are the main two types observed in case of mutations affecting alpha and beta-globin genes respectively.  alpha-thalassaemia is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by defective production of the alpha chain of haemoglobin.  the beta-thalassemia is associated with abnormality in beta-globin gene, leading to imbalanced synthesis of alpha-/beta-globin chains.  alpha-thalassemia is the most common inherited disorder of hemoglobin (hb) synthesis in the world.  beta-thalassemia is an anemia caused by a relative excess of alpha-hemoglobin (alphahb) due to absent or reduced beta-hemoglobin (betahb) synthesis.  β-thalassemia (β-thal) is a common single gene autosomal recessive disorder resulting in severe anemia due to reduced or absent β-globin polypeptide synthesis.  the three patients homozygous for the alpha-globin gene locus (anti 3.7 kb arrangement) had beta(0)-thalassaemia mutations and a diagnosis of thalassaemia intermedia, preserving haemoglobin levels around 7-8 g/dl.  beta thalassemia is due to impaired production of beta globin chains, leading to a relative excess of alpha globin chains.  α-thalassemia, which is caused by defective synthesis of the hemoglobin α-globin chains, is the most commonly inherited recessive hemoglobin abnormality.  thalassemia is an inherited hematological disorder which can generally be classified according to the affected globin imbalance (alpha- or beta-globin) into two main types, i.e.  of the 17 beta-thalassaemia heterozygotes (six children and 11 adults), 16 had severe beta-thalassaemia mutations interacting with an additional alpha-globin gene (13 with alpha alpha alpha anti-3.7 and four with alpha alpha alpha anti-4.2).  it is caused mainly by point mutations or, more rarely, deletions on the β-globin gene, leading to reduced (β+) or absent (β0) synthesis of the β chains of hemoglobin (hb).  here we described a large deletional mutation of the β-globin gene cluster previously unreported in the chinese population, the 3.5 kb deletion (nc_000011.10: g.5224302-5227791del3490bp) removing the β-globin gene promoter and the whole β-globin gene leading to a β0-thal phenotype. ||| ",no
Is Bladder training an effective method to treat  urge incontinence ?,"bladder training may be helpful for the treatment of urinary urge incontinence, but this conclusion can only be tentative, based on the evidence available.  in recent years, several studies have reported that bladder training, a behavioral intervention in which the interval between voluntary voidings is gradually extended, is an effective therapy for ""urge"" urinary incontinence (incontinence often associated with inability to inhibit detrusor contractions).  bladder training is widely used for the treatment of urinary incontinence.  bladder training is a simple, safe, and effective treatment in the management of mild to moderate forms of urinary incontinence in outpatient populations.  to assess the effects of bladder training for the treatment of urinary incontinence.  randomised or quasi-randomised trials of bladder training for the treatment of incontinence.  bladder training is a modification of bladder drill that is conducted more gradually on an outpatient basis and has resulted in significant reduction of incontinence in older, community-dwelling women.  this article describes the implementation of a 6-week bladder training program for a female patient with both stress and urge incontinence.  behavioral interventions have been used for decades to treat urge incontinence and other symptoms of overactive bladder.  pelvic floor muscle training is the most commonly used physical therapy treatment for women with stress urinary incontinence (sui).  bladder training is, therefore, a successful non-invasive technique devoid of complications and is recommended for the treatment of mild detrusor instability.  biofeedback to teach pelvic floor muscle control, verbal feedback based on vaginal palpation, and a self-help booklet in a first-line behavioral training program all achieved comparable improvements in urge incontinence in community-dwelling older women.  recent research on pelvic muscle exercises, which are known to be effective in stress and mixed urinary incontinence, has demonstrated that this therapy has a durable effect.  previous research on urge urinary incontinence has demonstrated that multicomponent behavioral training with biofeedback is safe and effective, yet it has not been established whether biofeedback is an essential component that heightens therapeutic efficacy.  although behavioral and drug therapies are known to be highly effective for reducing urge incontinence, few patients are cured with either treatment alone.  physiotherapy involving pelvic-floor muscle training is advocated as first-line treatment for stress urinary incontinence; midurethral-sling surgery is generally recommended when physiotherapy is unsuccessful.  this study aimed to assess the effectiveness of inpatient bladder retraining.  we evaluated the effects of biofeedback-guided pelvic floor muscle training (emg-bf), with and without extracorporeal magnetic innervation (emg-bf+exmi) therapy on lower urinary tract symptoms based on frequency of stress urinary incontinence (sui) and grams of urine loss, health-related quality of life, and sexual function in women with sui.  related behavioral therapies may also be effective for incontinence associated with impaired mobility and cognitive status.  the study confirms the usefulness of inpatient bladder retraining as a treatment option, especially in people refractory to outpatient management. ||| ",yes
Is Brucella abortus the organism that causes brucillosis known to cause spontaneous abortions in humans?,"brucella abortus is a bacterium of brucellosis causing abortion in cattle.  brucella abortus (b. abortus), an important zoonotic pathogen in brucella spp., is the major causative agent of abortion in cattle (namely, bovine brucellosis).  brucella abortus is a facultative intracellular bacterial pathogen that causes abortion in domestic animals and undulant fever in humans.  brucella abortus is a facultative intracellular bacterial pathogen that causes abortion in domestic animals and undulant fever in humans.  brucella abortus is a facultative intracellular gram-negative bacterial pathogen that causes abortion in pregnant cattle and undulant fever in humans.  brucella abortus is a facultative intracellular bacterium that causes brucellosis, a prevalent zoonosis that leads to abortion and infertility in cattle, and undulant fever, debilitating arthritis, endocarditis, and meningitis in humans.  there is evidence that brucellosis can induce abortion in humans.  brucella abortus is a facultative, intracellular zoonotic pathogen which can cause undulant fever in humans and abortions in cattle.  brucella abortus, a facultative intracellular pathogen, is of tremendous zoonotic importance because of its ability to induce spontaneous abortion in cattle and other livestock.  brucella abortus is a gram-negative intracellular bacterial pathogen that causes a zoonosis of worldwide occurrence, leading to undulant fever in humans and abortion in domestic animals.  this paper was carried out on selected women with abortion or history of abortion to clarify the role of brucellosis in human abortion.  brucella abortus is a facultative intracellular pathogen that causes a zoonosis called brucellosis.  the cell tropism of brucella abortus, a causative agent of brucellosis and facultative intracellular pathogen, in the placenta is thought to be a key event of infectious abortion, although the molecular mechanism for this is largely unknown.  the bacterial genus brucella consists of a group of facultative intracellular pathogens which produces abortion and infertility in animals and a chronic debilitating febrile illness in humans.  brucella abortus is a facultative intracellular gram-negative bacterial pathogen that infects humans and animals by entry mainly through the digestive tract.  in the present study, we found that brucella abortus, a causative agent of brucellosis and facultative intracellular pathogen, caused sterility in pregnant mice.  however, only a few studies on human spontaneous abortion attributable to brucella have been reported.  brucellosis is a worldwide zoonotic disease caused by brucella spp.  in this work, the patient living in shanxi province in china who had suffered a spontaneous abortion was underwent pathogen detection and brucella melitensis biovar 3 was identified.  are facultative intracellular bacteria that cause brucellosis, which is a globally occurring zoonotic disease that is characterized by abortion in domestic animals and undulant fever, arthritis, endocarditis, and meningitis in humans. ||| ",no
Is CD56 useful in Ewing sarcoma prognosis?,"cd56 and cd57 are commonly considered as natural killer and neuroectodermal markers, but their expression has been identified in a wide spectrum of neoplasms including some cases of ewing's sarcoma (es) and primitive neuroectodermal tumor (pnet).  by cox regression analysis, cd56 was found to be an independent prognostic marker with an 11-fold increased risk for relapse in patients with localized disease (p = 0.006).  mm cells of 99 patients prior to treatment with high-dose chemotherapy were analysed for cd56 expression by flow cytometry.  aim of our retrospective study was to analyse whether cd56 expression on mm cells reveals as a prognostic factor in patients treated with high-dose chemotherapy.  early detection of metastasis and recurrence of ewing sarcoma (es) is important for early management.  lack of cd56 expression was reported to be associated with a poor prognosis in multiple myeloma (mm) patients treated with conventional chemotherapy.  thirty patients (32%) showed cd56 expression.  ewing sarcoma (es) is a highly malignant pediatric tumor with a low survival rate and a high rate of metastasis.  cd56 expression could be used to reveal es patients with excellent prognosis or patients predisposed to relapse, thus improving treatment stratification and implementation of personalized therapy.  combined with other well-established prognostic factors such as wbc count, cd56 expression at diagnosis might be used to build prognostic scores for risk-adapted therapy in apl.  we investigated the prognostic relevance of cd56 in a series of patients with apl who were treated homogeneously with all-trans-retinoic acid (atra) and chemotherapy.  this study demonstrated the prognostic value of cd56 and cd117 in patients with newly diagnosed mm patients.  the literature on cd56 and cd57 expression in es/pnet is reviewed and discussed.  the objective of the current study was to evaluate whether the presence of p16(ink4a) alteration is associated with a poorer prognosis in patients with ewing sarcomas.  in summary, our results indicate that lack of cd56 expression on mm cells is not a prognostic marker in patients treated with high-dose chemotherapy, but is associated with t(11;14).  multiparameter flow cytometry (mpfc) was used to detect es cells in bone marrow (bm) of es patients at diagnosis and to evaluate the prognostic significance of cd56 expression in bm samples.  the presence of p16(ink4a) alteration was a statistically significant predictor of prognosis for patients with ewing sarcoma.  our aim was to evaluate whether telomere length could be a better prognostic factor in ewing sarcoma and correlate the results with clinical variables, outcome, and chromosomal instability.  the expression of cd56 is significantly associated with inferior cr duration and survival in patients with apl who were treated with modern frontline treatment that included atra and simultaneous chemotherapy.  we suggest that reduction of telomere length in tumor cells at diagnosis could serve as a prognostic marker in ewing sarcoma. ||| ",yes
Is CD84 genetically associated with arthritis?,"cd4 is a candidate gene in autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis (ra).  rheumatoid arthritis (ra) is an autoimmune disease which may lead to severe disabilities due to structural joint damage and extraarticular manifestations the dendritic cell marker cd83 belongs to the immunoglobulin superfamily and has previously been associated with autoimmune diseases.  cd8+ t cells are abundant in rheumatoid arthritis (ra).  the strong association between specific alleles encoded within the mhc class ii region and the development of rheumatoid arthritis (ra) has provided the best evidence to date that cd4+ t cells play a role in the pathogenesis of this chronic inflammatory disease.  although a role for cd8+ t cells in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (ra) has been suggested, the precise nature of their involvement is not fully understood.  rheumatoid arthritis is genetically linked to major histocompatibility complex (mhc) molecules (hla-dr4 and related molecules) and characterized pathologically by high levels of hla-dr expression and infiltration of proliferative of synovial tissue with cd4+ t lymphocytes.  considerable evidence indicates that cd4(+) t cells are important in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (ra), but the antigens recognized by these t cells in the joints of patients remain unclear.  we examined whether an association of cd4 enhancer gene polymorphisms with rheumatoid arthritis (ra) and systemic lupus erythematosus (sle) exists.  rheumatoid arthritis is characterized by synovial joint infiltration of activated cd4(+) t cells and mhc class ii(+) apc, and is linked to specific hla-dr alleles.  in ra the levels of soluble cd83 (scd83) are elevated in synovial fluid, however little is known about cd83 expression and regulation in ra.  rheumatoid arthritis (ra) is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disease in which unknown arthrogenic autoantigen is presented to cd4+ t cells.  the objective of this study is to provide more insight into the phenotype and function cd8(+) t cells during the development of autoimmune disease by studying cd8(+) t cells in human lymph-node biopsies and peripheral blood obtained during the earliest phases of rheumatoid arthritis (ra).  most cd4 t cells in ra joints expressed memory/activation markers, such as cd45ro, hla-dr, and cd69.  rheumatoid arthritis patients had increased levels of scd83 in plasma compared with healthy volunteers.  our results suggest that the genetic polymorphisms at the cd4 enhancer gene are associated with the risk of development of ra and sle.  synovial fluid from ra patients had a greater percentage of cd8s6f1 cells compared with either peripheral blood of matched patients or synovial fluid of oa patients.  to verify whether this is a unique feature of cd4 t cells in ra joints, we performed comparative flow cytometric analysis of cd4 t cells in ra and osteoarthritis (oa) joints.  subjects with the cc genotype of cd4-11743 were significantly more likely to develop ra (or = 2.7, p = 0.03) and more likely to have sever ra (or = 2.7, p = 0.024).  cd4-11743 genetic polymorphisms are associated with the susceptibility and severity of ra, and cd4-10845 genetic polymorphisms are associated with the severity of ra.  to investigate the role of cd8 cell subsets in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (ra) and the phenotypes of t cells adherent or non-adherent to the target cells (endothelial cells and synovial cells) pre-treated with il-1 beta. ||| ",yes
Is CD99 encoded by MIC2 gene?,"cd99 is a 32-kda transmembrane glycoprotein that is encoded by the mic2 gene.  human cd99 (mic2) is a 32 kda cell surface protein and its encoding gene is localized to the pseudoautosomal regions of both xp and yp chromosomes.  human cd99, which is encoded by the mic2 gene, is a ubiquitous 32 kda transmembrane protein.  cd99, also known as p30/32, is a glycoprotein product of the mic2 gene.  the leukocyte surface molecule cd99 is an integral membrane glycoprotein encoded by the e2/mic2 gene.  cd99 (mic2; single-chain type-1 glycoprotein) is a heavily o-glycosylated transmembrane protein (32 kda) present on leukocytes and activated endothelium.  cd99(mic2) is a widely expressed cell surface glycoprotein and functions as a tumor suppressor involved in downregulation of src family of tyrosine kinase.  although sequences of several genes such as human pbdx and mic2r are known to be related to that of cd99, the murine counterpart of cd99 has not been reported.  cd99, the product of the mic2 gene, exhibits an erythroid-specific quantitative polymorphism co-regulated with the xga blood group polymorphism.  in the present study two cd99 mabs, mt99/1 and mt99/2, were produced.  cd99-like 2 (cd99l2) is a type i glycoprotein expressed on leukocytes and endothelial cells as well as other cell types.  these observations support the inference that the evolutionary conserved gene, cd99l2, originated from a common ancestor gene of cd99, and its high conservation among species implies at least some essential function.  cd99, a leukocyte surface molecule, reportedly plays an important role in several cellular processes.  quantitative differences were confirmed by western blot analysis of red cell membrane preparations from individuals of different xga and cd99 phenotypes and by northern blot analysis showing that the reticulocytes from cd99-l individuals expressed a reduced level of mic2 transcripts compared to cd99-h donors.  in the present study, we confirmed the presence of cd99 ligands in immune cells.  we demonstrate that cd94 is a type ii membrane protein encoded by a unique gene of the c-type lectin superfamily.  our previous study showed that recombinant cd99 bound to cd99 ligands was expressed on monocytes, nk cells and dendritic cells.  using mouse cd99 gene, we show that cd99 forms homodimer through its extracellular domain.  we are the first to show that growth factor activated endothelial cells express a distinct human cd99 isoform.  as determined by in situ hybridization analysis, the cd99l2 gene appeared to be expressed particularly high in neuronal cells despite its ubiquitous distribution. ||| ",yes
Is CHEK2 involved in cell cycle control?,"they play an important role in the control of the cell cycle.  ccrk activates cdk2, which controls the cell-cycle progression by phosphorylating a threonine residue conserved in cdk2.  the chek2 kinase (chk2 in mouse) is a member of a dna damage response pathway that regulates cell cycle arrest at cell cycle checkpoints and facilitates the repair of dsdna breaks by a recombination-mediated mechanism.  cell cycle-related kinase (ccrk) is a novel protein kinase homologous to both cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (cdk7) and cak1p groups of cdk-activating kinase (cak).  the chk2 gene encodes a protein kinase that is important for the regulation of cell cycle arrest after dna damage.  checkpoint kinase 2 (chk2) is a dna damage-activated protein kinase which is involved in cell cycle checkpoint control.  we have analyzed the cell cycle regulation of human cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (cdk2), a protein closely related to the cell cycle-regulatory protein kinase cdc2.  chek2 gen encodes cell cycle checkpoint kinase 2 that participates in the dna repair pathway, cell cycle regulation and apoptosis.  these findings suggest that cdk2 and cdc2, in association with distinct cyclins, regulate separate functions in the mammalian cell cycle.  the chek2 gene encodes the chk2 protein, which is kinase involved in dna repair processes.  checkpoint kinase 2 (chk2) is a serine-threonine kinase with a role in dna repair, cell cycle arrest or apoptosis in response to dna damage.  we find that cdk2 activity, like that of cdc2, oscillates during the cell cycle in cultured mammalian fibroblasts.  chk2/hcds1 plays important roles in the dna damage-induced cell cycle checkpoint by phosphorylating several important targets, such as cdc25 and p53.  if a cell is exposed to exogenous damage to its dna, chk1/chk2 stops the cell cycle to give time to the cellular mechanisms to repair dna breakage and apoptosis too, if the damage is not repairable to activate programmed cell death.  chk1: gene encodes for a serine/threonine kinase involved in the regulation of cell cycle progression and dna damage checkpoints.  checkpoint kinase 1 (chk1) is an integral component of the cell cycle as well as the dna damage response (ddr) pathway.  the serine threonine checkpoint kinase 2 (chk2) is a critical protein involved in the dna damage-response pathway, which is activated by phosphorylation inducing cellular response such as dna repair, cell-cycle regulation or apoptosis.  ck2 (casein kinase 2) is a serine/threonine-selective protein kinase that has been involved in a variety of cellular processes such as dna repair, cell cycle control and circadian rhythm regulation.  we identify several unexpected patterns for core cell-cycle proteins in actively proliferating (cdk2-increasing) versus spontaneously quiescent (cdk2-low) cells, including cyclin d1, the levels of which we find to be higher in spontaneously quiescent versus proliferating cells.  here, we briefly outline the molecular properties, regulation and physiological role of chek2, and review in more detail its defects that predispose to tumors, with particular emphasis on familial breast cancer. ||| ",yes
Is COL5A2 gene associated to ischemic heart disease?,"the aim of the present study is to evaluate the association of a novel variation (901a > g) of c5l2 gene with coronary artery disease (cad).  increasing studies have reported that 5'-nucleotidase cytosolic ii (nt5c2) has a strong relationship with coronary heart disease (chd) development.  previous case-control studies suggested the single nucleotide polymorphism of cyclooxygenase-2 (cox-2) gene (g-765c) is associated with coronary artery disease (cad) and ischemic stroke.  however, little is known about the variations in the coding region of the c5l2 gene and their association with coronary artery disease (cad).  the rs2621215 snp in intron 46 of the col1a2 gene was found to be marginally associated with an increased risk of ia development in the korean population examined.  the cyclooxygenase-2 (cox-2) rs20417 polymorphism has been implicated in coronary artery disease (cad) risk, but individually published studies have shown inconsistent results.  the aim of this study was to explore the role of variants of the gene encoding arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein (alox5ap) as possible susceptibility factors for coronary artery disease (cad) and myocardial infarction (mi) in patients with or without angiographically proven cad.  in this study, we investigated whether the rs42524 and rs2621215 polymorphisms of the col1a2 gene are associated with the development of cerebral aneurysms in the korean population.  lipoprotein-associated phospholipase a2 (lp-pla2) activity has been reported to be associated with coronary artery disease (cad) and myocardial infarction (mi).  conclusions this meta-analysis suggests col1a2 rs42524 is a significant risk factor for ia susceptibility, with an especially strong effect in asian people.  our objective was to study whether the functional c variant of the -765g-->c polymorphism in the human cox-2 gene associates with the severity of coronary atherosclerosis measured at the coronary artery level.  in conclusion, we demonstrate that cox-2 rs5277 c allele increases the risk of left main coronary artery lesion and is also correlated with poor prognosis of lmcad patients with cabg therapy.  significant association between cox-2 rs20417 polymorphism and risk of cad was observed in co-dominant model (or=0.64, 95% ci=0.43-0.95, p=0.026) and recessive model (or=0.77, 95% ci=0.61-0.97, p=0.025).  rs2148198 of nt5c2 was strongly associated with an increased risk of chd (allele: p = 0.045; codominant: p = 0.007; additive: p = 0.016).  this study suggests that the cox2 -765g>c polymorphism is a possible genetic determinant for the risk of cad, and an individual risk factor in koreans.  we performed a meta-analysis to assess the association between col1a2 rs42524 polymorphism and the risk of intracranial aneurysm.  pooling results indicated a significant association between col1a2 rs42524 polymorphism and intracranial aneurysm risk under 4 genetic models (c vs. g: or=1.74, 95%ci=1.34-2.26; gc vs. gg: or=1.81, 95%ci=1.37-2.41; cc+gc vs. gg: or=1.74, 95%ci=1.28-2.36; cc vs. gc+gg: or=1.76, 95%ci=1.02-3.04).  furtherly, long-term follow-up data suggested that rs5277 c allele carriage increased risk of major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (macce) in the whole cohort (adjusted hr: 1.561; 95% ci: 1.025~2.377; p = 0.038) and lmcad subgroup (adjusted hr: 2.014; 95% ci: 1.036~3.913; p = 0.039) but not in mpcad subgroup (adjusted hr: 1.375; 95% ci: 0.791~2.392; p = 0.259).  in this study, we genotyped cox-2 rs5275, rs5277, and rs689466 of 1544 cad patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (cabg) and found that rs5277 c allele carriage was associated with lmcad (adjusted or: 1.590; 95% ci: 1.103~2.291; p = 0.013).  background col1a2, which encodes collagen type i alpha2, has long been suggested to be a potential positional and functional candidate gene for intracranial aneurysm. ||| ",yes
Is CREB a key memory protein?,"transcription factor camp response element-binding protein (creb) plays a critical role in memory formation.  the cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element binding protein (creb) is a phosphorylation-dependent transcription factor that plays important roles in memory consolidation and several neuropsychological disorders.  phosphorylation of the transcription factor creb is thought to be important in processes underlying long-term memory.  creb is a pivotal mediator of activity-regulated gene transcription that underlies memory formation and allocation.  cyclic amp-responsive element binding protein (creb) is critically involved in many important brain functions, including the formation of long-term memory.  the transcription factor camp response element binding protein (creb) is a key protein implicated in memory, synaptic plasticity and structural plasticity in mammals.  the camp response element-binding protein (creb) is an evolutionarily conserved transcription regulator essential for long-term memory formation.  recent studies suggest that the creb-cre transcriptional pathway is pivotal in the formation of some types of long-term memory.  numerous genetic studies have shown that the creb-binding protein (cbp) is an essential component of long-term memory formation, through its histone acetyltransferase (hat) function.  the transcription factor camp-response element binding protein 2 (creb2), a member of the family of basic region leucine zipper proteins, has been suggested to function in the brain as a repressor of long-term memory.  ample data indicate that camp-response element-binding protein (creb) is essential for the formation of long-term memory in various species and learning systems.  the camp-responsive element binding protein (creb) gene transcription factor has been implicated in the synaptic plasticity and memory.  creb-dependent transcription necessary for long-term memory is driven by interactions with creb-binding protein (cbp), a multi-domain protein that binds numerous transcription factors potentially affecting expression of thousands of genes.  therefore, we elucidate that creb is responsible for the short term memory response in c. elegans against bacterial pathogens.  camp-responsive element binding protein (creb) phosphorylation and signaling plays an important role in long-term memory formation, but other posttranslational modifications of creb are less known.  human cyclic amp response element binding protein (creb) transcription factor which plays a crucial role in memory has a homolog in c. elegans, crh-1.  phosphorylation of camp-response element binding protein (creb) is required for hippocampus-dependent long-term memory formation.  these results suggest that the binding of crem to cre sites requires the presence of creb delta/alpha, and that creb-beta may be inefficient in binding to cre-sites.  these results indicate that c/ebps are evolutionarily conserved components of the creb-dependent gene cascade activated in long-term memory.  although creb seems to be important for memory formation, it is not known which of the isoforms of creb, crem, or atf1 are expressed in the neurons that undergo long-term synaptic changes and what roles they have in memory formation. ||| ",yes
Is CXCL7 a chemokine?,"cxcl7 is a potent chemoattractant and activator of neutrophil function.  cxcr7 binds chemokines cxcl11 (i-tac) and cxcl12 (sdf-1) but does not act as a classical chemoattractant receptor.  cxcr7 ligands, such as the chemokine cxcl11 and the newly described synthetic molecule ccx771, may represent novel therapeutic opportunities for the control of such cells.  cx3cl1 is a unique chemokine that can exist in a soluble form, as a chemotactic cytokine, or in a membrane-attached form that acts as a binding molecule.  chemokine (c-c motif) ligand 7 (ccl7), a cc chemokine, is a chemotactic factor and attractant for various kinds of leukocytes, including monocytes and neutrophils.  c-x-c chemokine receptor 7 (cxcr7), a novel receptor of c-x-c motif chemokine ligand 12 (cxcl12), is associated with the occurrence and metastasis of various malignant tumours.  among more than 200 chemokines, cx3cl1 is a special chemotactic factor existing in both membrane-bound and soluble forms.  while most chemokines are members of the cc or cxc subgroups, xcl1, also known as lymphotactin, is the sole member of the c subgroup.  many cells, including leucocytes and stromal cells, express cxcl7, a member of the cxc chemokine family, also known as platelet basic protein.  (c-x-c motif) ligand (cxcl)10 (cxcl10) belongs to the elr(-) cxc subfamily chemokine.  cxcl10 is also known as an interferon-γ-inducible chemokine involved in various biological phenomena, including chemotaxis of natural killer (nk) cells and cytotoxic t lymphocytes, that suppress tumor growth and inhibition of angiogenesis.  cxc chemokine receptor 7 (cxcr7) is a g-protein-coupled receptor that signals through the β-arrestin pathway.  cxcl7 exerts its function by activating the cxc chemokine receptor 2 (cxcr2) receptor and binding sulfated glycosaminoglycans (gags) that regulate receptor activity.  c-x-c chemokine receptor type 7 (cxcr7) has recently been characterised as a novel receptor for the c-x-c motif chemokine 12 (cxcl12)/stromal cell-derived factor 1-alpha.  chemokine (c-x-c motif) ligand 6 (cxcl6), a member of the cxc chemokine family, reportedly mediates several processes such as inflammation, immunoreaction, cell growth, and metastasis through interaction with the chemokine receptors cxcr1 and cxcr2 in humans; further, cxcr1 and cxcr2 can promote repair and regeneration of organs or tissues after ischemia-reperfusion injury (iri).  cxc chemokine ligand 10 (cxcl10) is a cxc chemokine family protein that transmits signals by binding to its specific receptor, cxcr3.  it is known that the chemokine receptor cxcr7 (rdc1) can be engaged by both chemokines cxcl12 (sdf-1) and cxcl11 (i-tac), but the exact expression pattern and function of cxcr7 is controversial.  platelet-derived chemokine cxcl7 (also known as nap-2) plays a crucial role in orchestrating neutrophil recruitment in response to vascular injury.  cxcl10 exerts its function through binding to chemokine (c-x-c motif) receptor 3 (cxcr3), a seven trans-membrane receptor coupled to g proteins.  several chemokines/chemokine receptors such as ccr7, cxcr4 and cxcr5 attract chronic lymphocytic leukemia (cll) cells to specific microenvironments. ||| ",yes
Is Calcium homeostasis important in cardiac physiology and pathophysiology?,"calcium homeostasis in the cardiomyocyte is critical to the regulation of normal cardiac function.  calcium has a fundamental role in the maintenance of myocardial function and vascular tone.  altered calcium homeostasis may play a key role in the pathophysiology of human heart failure.  calcium ions are important in many aspects of normal cardiac function as well as in the response to certain pathologic states.  the significance of abnormal calcium homeostasis under conditions of heart failure, myocardial infarction, ventricular fibrillation and cardiomyopathy is examined.  calcium (ca2+) is a key player in cardiomyocyte homeostasis, and its roles span from excitation-contraction coupling to metabolic and structural signaling.  calcium is an important mediator in cardiac excitation and disorders in cardiac ca(2+) homeostasis have great influence on the cardiac action potential.  calcium cycling is crucial in the excitation-contraction coupling of cardiomyocytes, and therefore has a key role in cardiac functionality.  a specific calcium-sensing receptor on cardiac myocytes could play a role in regulating cardiac development, function, and homeostasis.  disturbed myocardial calcium (ca(+)) handling is one of the pathophysiologic hallmarks of cardiovascular diseases such as congestive heart failure, cardiac hypertrophy, and certain types of tachyarrhythmias.  calcium (ca2+) is a key mediator of myocardial function.  the control of intracellular calcium is central to regulation of cardiac contractility.  in this review, we summarize the role of local ca(2+) homeostasis in these processes in healthy cardiac muscle cells, and highlight how mismanaged ca(2+) handling contributes to the pathophysiology of conditions such as cardiac arrhythmia, ischemic heart disease, cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure.  abnormal ca(2+)homeostasis is often associated with chronic cardiovascular diseases, such as hypertension, heart failure or cardiac arrhythmias, and typically contributes to the basic ethiology of the disease.  the role of calcium in the mediation of myocardial damage under conditions of ischemia and secondary to a phenomenon known as 'the calcium paradox' is discussed.  proper cardiac ca2+ homeostasis is essential for normal excitation-contraction coupling.  calcium regulates contraction, and disruption of myocellular ca2+ handling plays a role in cardiac pathologies such as arrhythmias and heart failure.  cardiac disorders and different drugs alter the calcium transients of cardiomyocytes and can cause serious dysfunction of the heart.  both intra- and extracellular calcium play multiple roles in the physiology and pathophysiology of cardiomyocytes, especially in stimulus-contraction coupling.  however, proteins involved in calcium removal were significantly altered in the failing human heart: (1) sr-ca(2+)-atpase levels and the ratio of sr-ca(2+)-atpase to its inhibitory protein phospholamban were significantly decreased, and (2) na(+)-ca2+ exchanger levels and the ratio of na(+)-ca2+ exchanger to sr-ca(2+)-atpase were significantly increased. ||| ",yes
Is Calcium/Calmodulin dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) involved in cardiac arrhythmias and heart failure?,"in the recent years, ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase ii (camkii) was suggested to be associated with cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure but also with arrhythmias both in animal models as well as in the human heart.  calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase ii (camkii) has emerged as key enzyme in many cardiac pathologies, especially heart failure (hf), myocardial infarction and cardiomyopathies, thus leading to contractile dysfunction and malignant arrhythmias.  calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase ii (camkii) is activated in heart failure (hf) and can contribute to arrhythmias induced by β-adrenergic receptor-mediated sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium leak.  calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase ii (camkii) has been implicated in the transduction of calcium signals in the heart, but the specific isoforms of camkii that mediate pathological cardiac signaling have not been fully defined.  activation of ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase ii (camkii) is established as a central intracellular trigger for various cardiac pathologies such as hypertrophy, heart failure or arrhythmias in animals and humans suggesting camkii as a promising target protein for future medical treatments.  the multifunctional ca(2+)- and calmodulin-dependent protein kinase ii (camkii) is a crucial mediator of cardiac physiology and pathology.  the multifunctional ca(2+)/calmodulin (cam)-dependent protein kinase ii (camkii) has emerged as a proarrhythmic and procardiomyopathic signal in a wide range of structural heart diseases.  excessive activation of calmodulin kinase ii (camkii) causes arrhythmias and heart failure, but the cellular mechanisms for camkii-targeted proteins causing disordered cell membrane excitability and myocardial dysfunction remain uncertain.  calcium-calmodulin dependent protein kinase iiδ (camkiiδ) is an important regulator of cardiac electrophysiology, calcium (ca) balance, contraction, transcription, arrhythmias and progression to heart failure.  calcium-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase ii (camkii) has emerged as a central mediator of cardiac stress responses which may serve several critical roles in the regulation of cardiac rhythm, cardiac contractility and growth.  calmodulin kinase ii (camkii) mediates critical signaling pathways responsible for divergent functions in the heart including calcium cycling, hypertrophy and apoptosis.  although ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase-ii (camk) is known to phosphorylate different ca(2+) cycling proteins in the cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum (sr) and regulate its function, the status of camk in heart failure has not been investigated previously.  ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase ii (camkii) has been implicated in the regulation of cardiac excitation-contraction coupling (ecc) as well as in apoptotic signaling and adverse remodeling.  calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase ii (camkii) is a multifunctional serine/threonine kinase expressed abundantly in the heart.  calmodulin-dependent protein kinase ii (camkii) has been proposed to be a therapeutic target for heart failure (hf).  camkii targets numerous proteins involved in excitation-contraction coupling and excitability, and its activation may simultaneously contribute to heart failure and cardiac arrhythmias.  ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase ii (camkii) is an enzyme with important regulatory functions in the heart and brain, and its chronic activation can be pathological.  calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase type ii delta (camkiiδ), the predominant camkii isoform expressed in the heart, has been implicated in the progression of myocardial infarction- and pressure overload-induced pathological remodeling.  dysfunction in the camkii signaling pathway occurs in heart disease and is associated with increased susceptibility to life-threatening arrhythmia.  increased expression and activation of camkii has been linked to elevated risk for arrhythmic events and is a hallmark of human heart failure. ||| ",yes
Is Citrobacter rodentium pathogenic?,"citrobacter rodentium is a murine pathogen causing transmissible colonic hyperplasia and colitis with a pathogenic mechanism similar to foodborne enterohaemorrhagic escherichia coli in humans.  citrobacter rodentium is an attaching and effacing pathogen which causes transmissible colonic hyperplasia in mice.  citrobacter rodentium is a gram-negative, murine-specific enteric pathogen that infects epithelial cells in the colon.  citrobacter rodentium is an attaching and effacing intestinal murine pathogen which shares similar virulence strategies with the human pathogens enteropathogenic- and enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli to infect their host.  citrobacter rodentium (formally citrobacter freundii biotype 4280) is a highly infectious pathogen that causes colitis and transmissible colonic hyperplasia in mice.  citrobacter rodentium is a gram-negative bacterium which causes transmissible murine colonic hyperplasia and models the virulence of enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli in vivo.  citrobacter rodentium is a mouse pathogen that causes infectious colitis and shares characteristics with human enteropathogenic (epec) and enterohemorrhagic (ehec) escherichia coli, including the ability to cause attaching and effacing lesions in the colon and serves as a useful model to study the pathogenicity of these bacteria.  citrobacter rodentium is a natural mouse pathogen related to enteropathogenic and enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli.  citrobacter rodentium is a natural murine intestinal pathogen that shares a core set of virulence factors with the related human pathogens enteropathogenic escherichia coli (epec) and enterohemorrhagic e. coli (ehec).  citrobacter rodentium is a natural mouse pathogen widely used as a model for enteropathogenic and enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli infections in humans.  citrobacter rodentium is a mouse-specific pathogen commonly used to model infection by human enteropathogenic escherichia coli, an important cause of infant diarrhea and mortality worldwide.  citrobacter rodentium is a murine pathogen that transiently colonizes the lumen of the large intestine.  citrobacter rodentium belongs to the attaching and effacing family of enteric bacterial pathogens that includes both enteropathogenic and enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli.  citrobacter rodentium is a naturally occurring murine pathogen that causes colonic epithelial-cell hyperplasia, disrupts the colonic mucosa, and elicits a predominantly t helper 1 cellular immune response; it thereby serves as a model for the study of mechanisms of disease induced by human attaching-effacing pathogens.  citrobacter rodentium (formerly citrobacter freundii biotype 4280 and citrobacter genomospecies 9) was described on the basis of biochemical characterization and dna-dna hybridization data and is the only citrobacter species known to possess virulence factors homologous to those of the human pathogens enteropathogenic escherichia coli and enterohemorrhagic e. coli.  citrobacter rodentium, a murine model pathogen for enteropathogenic escherichia coli, colonizes the surface of intestinal epithelial cells and causes mucosal inflammation.  citrobacter rodentium, a murine model pathogen for human enteropathogenic escherichia coli, predominantly colonizes the lumen and mucosal surface of the colon and cecum and causes crypt hyperplasia and mucosal inflammation.  here we review the history, clinical significance, pathology and molecular pathogenesis of citrobacter rodentium, the causative agent of transmissible murine colonic hyperplasia.  citrobacter rodentium, a natural mouse pathogen, belongs to the family of extracellular enteric pathogens that includes enteropathogenic escherichia coli (epec) and enterohemorrhagic e. coli (ehec).  citrobacter rodentium, which colonizes the gut mucosa via formation of attaching and effacing (a/e) lesions, causes transmissible colonic hyperplasia. ||| ",yes
Is Cri Du Chat associated with an expansion of a repeat with in the gene found on chromosome 5?,"cri-du-chat syndrome (cdcs; omim#123450) is a classic contiguous gene syndrome caused by chromosome 5p terminal deletion (5p-), which characterized by a high-pitched cat-like cry, developmental delay, severe psychomotor, mental retardation, and dysmorphic features in infancy.  cri du chat or 5p minus (5p-) syndrome is characterized by a deletion located on the chromosome 5 short (-p) arm and has an incidence rate of 1 in 50,000 individuals worldwide.  cri-du-chat syndrome (mim 123450) is a chromosomal syndrome characterized by the characteristic features, including cat-like cry and chromosome 5p deletions.  cri du chat (cdc) syndrome is a rare genetic condition caused by the deletion of genetic material on the small arm (the p arm) of chromosome 5.  cri du chat syndrome (cdcs) is a well-defined clinical entity, with an incidence of 1/15,000 to 1/50,000.  we postulate that the unique ccrs in the phenotypically normal mother could resulted from chromosome 5p chromothripsis, that further resulted in the interstitial 5p deletions in the unaffected daughter.  we have identified five ccg alleles from 205 normal chromosomes, with 137 (67%) having alleles of seven repeats, five (2%) with nine repeats, 61 (30%) with 10 repeats, one (0.5%) with 11 repeats and one (0.5%) with 12 repeats.  ggggcc repeat expansions in the c9orf72 gene are the most common cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia (c9als/ftd).  the repeat expansion undergoes unconventional translation to produce five dipeptide repeat proteins (dprs).  a hexanucleotide repeat expansion in the c9orf72 gene has been identified as the most common cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia.  a ggggcc hexanucleotide repeat expansion in the c9orf72 gene has been identified as the most common genetic cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia.  the phenotypically normal mother had de novo ccrs involving 11 breakpoints and three chromosomes: ins(11;5) (q23;p14.1p15.31),ins(21;5)(q21;p13.3p14.1),ins(21;5)(q21;p15.31p15.33),inv(7)(p22q32)dn.  the polymorphic cag repeat that is expanded on huntington disease (hd) chromosomes is flanked by a ccg repeat.  the expansion of a noncoding hexanucleotide repeat (ggggcc) in the chromosome 9 open reading frame (c9orf72) gene has been identified as the most common cause of familial and sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (als) in caucasian populations.  we report a family with five individuals showing chromosomal rearrangements involving 5p, resulting from rare maternal complex chromosomal rearrangements (ccrs), diagnosed post- and pre-natally by comprehensive molecular and cytogenetic analyses.  aberrant expansion of the hexanucleotide ggggcc (or g4c2) repeat in the human c9orf72 gene is the most common genetic factor found behind amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia.  the hexanucleotide repeat (ggggcc) expansion in c9orf72 is accounted for a large proportion of the genetic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (als) and frontotemporal dementia (ftd).  our results suggest that the c9orf72 repeat expansion is not the main cause of als in the korean population.  several of these behaviors have been previously reported in patients with 5p deletion syndrome.  it has been reported that hexanucleotide repeat expansions in c9orf72 produce five dipeptide repeat (dpr) proteins by an unconventional repeat-associated non-atg (ran) translation. ||| ",no
Is Crohn's disease (CD) linked to the consumption of refrigerated food?,"recently, it has been suggested that refrigerated food could be involved in disease development.  this study supports the opinion that cd is associated with exposure to domestic refrigeration, among other household factors, during childhood.  diet may be an important factor in the progression of crohn's disease (cd).  crohn's disease (cd) is a chronic inflammatory condition of diverse etiology.  recent evidence points to a plausible role of diet and the microbiome in the pathogenesis of both crohn's disease (cd) and ulcerative colitis (uc).  diet is an important factor in both the pathogenesis and in the clinical course of crohn's disease (cd).  diet is known to play a major role in the symptoms of the inflammatory bowel disease, crohn's disease (cd).  patients were exposed earlier than controls to the refrigerator (x2 = 9.9, df = 3, p = 0.04) and refrigerator exposure at birth was found to be a risk factor for cd (or = 2.08 (95% ci: 1.01-4.29), p = 0.05).  crohn's disease (cd) is a chronic transmural inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract of unknown cause.  patients with crohn's disease (cd) often report food hypersensitivities with gastrointestinal (gi) symptoms despite being in clinical remission.  we thus conducted a pilot case control study to explore the association of cd with the exposure to domestic refrigeration in childhood.  there are so far no definite links between ulcerative colitis and diet, but links with crohn's disease have been studied by both epidemiologists and clinicians.  we performed a randomized controlled trial to determine whether reduced consumption of red and processed meats decreases the risk of symptomatic relapse of cd, analyzing results from the food and crohn's disease exacerbation study (faces) trial.  the aim of this study was to determine the relationship between gluten intake and risk of incident crohn's disease (cd) and ulcerative colitis (uc).  in this review, we discuss the recent epidemiological, gene-environment interaction, microbiome and animal studies that have explored the relationship between diet and the risk of ibd.  the links between nutrition and crohn's disease have now become strong and the role of fat may be the most exciting of all.  the kind of dietetic habits before the appearance of the illness in patients with crohn's disease (cd) has not been studied extensively.  the role of dietary factors in the etiology of crohn's disease (cd) is inconsistent largely due to difficulties in acquiring valid information on consumption habits.  crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, collectively known as ibd, are chronic inflammatory disorders of the gastrointestinal tract.  crohn's disease (cd) incidence has increased over the past fifty years but the explanation is unclear. ||| ",yes
Is Cryptococcus neoformans a frequent cause of isolated skin infections in immunocompromised individuals,"infection with cryptococcus neoformans often occurs in immunocompromised hosts.  cryptococcus neoformans is frequently present as an opportunistic pathogen mainly affecting immunocompromised populations.  cryptococcus neoformans is an opportunistic fungal pathogen that causes cryptococcosis in immunocompromised patients as well as immunocompetent individuals.  cryptococcus neoformans is a human pathogen ubiquitously present in the environment.  cryptococcosis is a systemic fungal infection caused by cryptococcus neoformans.  cryptococcosis is an opportunistic infection caused by cryptococcus neoformans that typically presents in immunocompromised patients, most commonly in those with human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) infection.  cryptococcus neoformans, the etiological agent of cryptococcosis, is an occasional opportunistic fungal pathogen of immune competent individuals.  cryptococcosis is a deep fungal infection caused by cryptococcus neoformans.  cryptococcus neoformans is an opportunistic fungal pathogen that causes lung inflammation and meningoencephalitis in immunocompromised patients but is also able to asymptomatically infect immunocompetent individuals.  cryptococcus neoformans is an opportunistic fungal pathogen preferentially causing disease in immunocompromised individuals such as organ-transplant-recipients, patients receiving immunosuppressive medications or, in particular, individuals suffering from hiv infection.  cryptococcosis is a common fungal infection in immunocompromised patients, caused by genus cryptococcus, presenting with meningitis, pneumonia, and skin lesions.  we report four cases of cryptococcosis with cutaneous manifestation not only for its rarity, but also to emphasize the important role of the dermatologist in the diagnosis of this disease.  cryptococcus neoformans, the predominant etiological agent of cryptococcosis, is an opportunistic fungal pathogen that primarily affects aids patients and patients undergoing immunosuppressive therapy.  cryptococcus neoformans (c. neoformans) is the most common cryptococcus species causing diseases in humans which can be presented as pulmonary, meningitis, cutaneous, and/or disseminated cryptococcosis.  cryptococcal disease most commonly occurs in patients with an underlying immune deficit, most commonly hiv infection, and is due to cryptococcus neoformans var.  cryptococcus neoformans is an opportunistic fungal pathogen that can cause lethal cryptococcal meningitis in immunocompromised individuals such as those with hiv/aids.  the presence of c. neoformans antibodies in adult human serum suggests that immune competent individuals have difficulty resolving an early cryptococcal infection allowing for the establishment of a subclinical chronic infection.  cryptococcus infection can be presented as a skin lesion which, if not treated properly at an earlier time, can result in dissemination and life-threatening consequences.  cryptococcus neoformans is one of the most common infectious agents causing central nervous system (cns) infections in immunocompromised patients.  we report a case of cutaneous cryptococcosis in a patient affected by chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. ||| ",no
Is Ctf4 involved in sister chromatid cohesion establishment?,"ctf4/and-1 is a highly conserved gene product required for both dna replication and the establishment of sister chromatid cohesion.  ctf4p (chromosome transmission fidelity) has been reported to function in dna metabolism and sister chromatid cohesion in saccharomyces cerevisiae.  we show here that ctf8, ctf4 and a helicase encoded by chl1 are required for efficient sister chromatid cohesion in unperturbed mitotic cells, and provide evidence that chl1 functions during s-phase.  it also plays a role in the establishment of sister chromatid cohesion.  here, we show that ctf18-rfc's role in sister chromatid cohesion correlates with pcna loading but is separable from its role in the replication checkpoint.  our finding that mutants in fission yeast ctf18 and dcc1 have similar defects suggests that the involvement of the alternative rf-c(ctf18/dcc1/ctf8) complex in sister chromatid cohesion might be highly conserved.  in budding yeast, a specialized replication factor c called rf-c(ctf18/dcc1/ctf8) and the dna-polymerase-alpha-associated protein ctf4 are required to maintain sister-chromatid cohesion in cells arrested for long periods in mitosis.  in addition to mediating sister chromatid cohesion during the cell cycle, the cohesin complex associates with ctcf and with active gene regulatory elements to form long-range interactions between its binding sites.  chromosome transmission fidelity 4 (ctf4) is a conserved protein required for dna replication.  cohesin is the protein complex responsible for maintaining sister chromatid cohesion.  these results demonstrate that and-1 and tim1-tipin are key factors linking dna replication and establishment of sister chromatid cohesion.  our results suggest that ctf18-rfc enriches and balances pcna levels at the replication fork, beyond the needs of dna replication, to promote establishment of sister chromatid cohesion and possibly other post-replicative processes.  cohesin acetyltransferases esco1 and esco2 play a vital role in establishing sister chromatid cohesion.  using a functional as well as a cytological assay, we demonstrate that ctf8, chl1 and ctf4 are essential for cohesion between sister centromeres during meiosis but dispensable for cohesin's association with centromeric dna.  taken together, we propose an evolutionarily conserved mechanism in which crl4s and pcna promote esco2-dependent establishment of sister chromatid cohesion.  cohesion establishment and maintenance are carried out by proteins that modify the activity of cohesin, an essential complex that holds sister chromatids together.  constituents of the replication fork, such as the dna polymerase alpha-binding protein ctf4, contribute to cohesion in ways that are poorly understood.  sister chromatid cohesion is established during s phase near the replication fork.  cohesin-mediated sister chromatid cohesion is established during the s-phase, and recent studies demonstrate that a cohesin protein ring concatenates sister dna molecules.  proper chromosome alignment and segregation during mitosis depend on cohesion between sister chromatids. ||| ",yes
Is Cystatin D a biomarker?,"previous studies indicated that cyclin d1 shown the potential as a tumor biomarker.  to evaluate the serum levels of vitamin d and its correlation with the clinical features and cytokine profiles in ssc patients.  cytokines are important mediators of tissue damage and clinical dysfunction in ssc and may be influenced by vitamin d levels.  despite the influence of d-type cyclins on prostate cancer proliferation, few studies have examined the expression of cyclin d1 in localised tumours or challenged its relevance to disease progression.  vitamin d may have prognostic value in cardiovascular disease (cvd) patients and, in addition to conventional biomarkers, could be a valuable tool for disease management.  vitamin d is involved in many biological processes.  relevance of cyclin d1 to preoperative prostate-specific antigen (psa) levels, ki-67 index, and p21cip1 status was also examined.  cyclin d1a expression was associated with tumor tissue size and degree of differentiation.  cyclin d1 status was characterised using immunohistochemistry in 38 non-neoplastic prostate samples, 138 primary human prostate carcinomas, and three lymph node metastatic specimens.  cyclin d3 promotes cell cycle progression but its expression and prognostic significance in human colorectal cancer is unknown.  these data demonstrate that differential cyclin d1 status may influence clinicopathological parameters, and reveal new insight as to the regulation and potential consequence of cyclin d1 expression in prostate cancer.  this study investigated the correlation of cyclin d1 expression with the prognostic and clinicopathological features in rcc patients.  assessment of cyclin d1a and d1b expression in cervical cancer and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia revealed that cyclin d1 could not be used as a reference to assess cervical cancer patient prognosis.  these data suggest that cyclin d2 expression may be associated with the type of growth arrest and nonproliferating state, but not with the cell proliferation and transformation.  objectives: we sought to determine the association of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin d  levels with the clinical biochemical parameters and mortality risk in chronic diseases.  relevance of altered cyclin d1 status was observed, wherein cyclin d1-positive tumours were associated with low preoperative psa levels, consistent with in vitro reports that cyclin d1 may alter the expression of this tumour marker.  the aim of this study was to assess the association of vitamin d status in patients with acute coronary syndrome (acs) and to evaluate its prognostic utility.  we studied the relationship between concentrations of the circulating biomarker 25-hydroxyvitamin d (25ohd) and all-cause and cardiovascular mortality risk.  serum levels of 25(oh) vitamin d were measured by chemiluminescence assay, and serum concentrations of interleukin 2 (il-2), il-4, il-6, il-10, tumor necrosis factor, and interferon γ were determined by flow cytometry.  we have previously shown that the d-type cyclins are critical for the androgen-dependent proliferation of prostate cells. ||| ",yes
Is DITPA a thyroid hormone analog utilized in experimental and clinical studies,"diiodothyropropionic acid (ditpa) is a thyroid hormone analog that is currently in phase ii clinical trials.  ditpa (3,5-diiodothyroproprionic acid) is a synthetic thyroid hormone analog with positive inotropic effects similar to thyroid hormone but with minimal systemic effects.  ditpa therapy lowered serum tsh levels and, to a lesser extent, serum t(3) and t(4), but there were no differences in clinical manifestations of thyrotoxicosis or hypothyroidism.  consequently, effects of diiodothyropropionic acid (ditpa) on body weight, serum lipoproteins, and bone metabolism markers were studied in a prospective, controlled, double-blind 24-wk trial, which was primarily designed to assess treatment of stable chronic heart failure.  the present study tested the hypothesis that 3,5-diiodothyropropionic acid (ditpa), a thyroid hormone analog with inotropic but not chronotopic characteristics, is angiogenic in the nonischemic heart.  this study compares the effects of ditpa with l-thyroxine (t4) on chamber remodeling, cardiac function, cellular morphology, cardiac blood flow, and protein expression.  drug induced thyroid effects were evaluated in organotypic models utilizing either a rat thyroid lobe or human thyroid slices to compare rodent and human response.  dii mrna and dii activity in cultured human thyroid cells were significantly stimulated by tsh in a dose-dependent manner.  eighty-six patients (aged 66 +/- 11 yr, mean +/- sd) were randomized (1:2) to placebo or an escalating ditpa dose (90 to 180, 270, and 360 mg/d) over 8 wk until serum tsh was less than 0.02 mu/liter.  similarly, thyroid from the rat in vivo study exhibited an up-regulation of dio1, slc5a5, lrp2, and tshr.  we have studied the expression of type ii iodothyronine deiodinase (dii) in human thyroid tumors and cultured human thyroid cells to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the regulation of dii expression in human thyroid gland.  this investigation of ditpa actions demonstrated its efficacy in reducing body weight and lowering total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels.  this review illustrates the complex array of interactions of dph with multiple elements of the thyroid hormone system ranging from effects on t4 and t3 metabolism, serum protein binding, serum and cellular concentration of thyroid hormones, nuclear t3 binding and biologic actions of t3, to effects on hypothalamic and pituitary regulation of tsh.  the clinically used thiourea drugs, methimazole (mmi) and 6-n-propyl-2-thioruacil (ptu), were used to evaluate thyroid drug response in these models.  background: in numerous studies based predominantly on rodent models, administration of 3,5-diiodo-l-thyronine (3,5-t2), a metabolite of the thyroid hormones (th) thyroxine (t4) and triiodo-l-thyronine (t3), was reported to cause beneficial health effects, including reversal of steatohepatosis and prevention of insulin resistance, in most instances without adverse thyrotoxic side effects.  thyroid tumor tissue and surrounding nontumor tissue were obtained at the time of surgery, and dii expression was compared between tumor tissue and nontumor tissue in each case.  thyrotropin response to both dopamine infusion (decremental) and iv metoclopramide bolus (incremental) was greater in patients with primary hypothyroidism than that in the control subjects.  in addition, long-term studies with ditpa have not been done.  the pleiotropic function of thyroid hormones (th) is mediated by an organ specific expression of thyroid hormone transporters, deiodinases and th receptors.  thyrotropin responses to dopamine infusion (4 microg/kg/min over 3 hours) and iv metoclopramide (10 mg bolus), a dopamine receptor blocker were studied in 25 consecutive patients with primary hypothyroidism before and after achieving stable euthyroid state and compared with 15 normal age-matched controls. ||| ",yes
Is DNA methylation an epigenetic modification of chromatin related to gene expression?,"dna methylation is an epigenetic event that may regulate gene expression.  dna methylation is the most studied form of epigenetic regulation, a process by which chromatin composition and transcription factor binding is altered to influence tissue specific gene expression and differentiation.  dna methylation is a chemically reversible epigenetic modification that regulates the chromatin structure and gene expression, and thereby takes part in various cellular processes like embryogenesis, genomic imprinting, x-chromosome inactivation, and genome stability.  dna methylation is an epigenetic modification that is enriched in heterochromatin but depleted at active promoters and enhancers.  dna methylation plays an important role in the regulation of gene expression, as it is the first epigenetic modification to take place on a given dna strand.  dna methylation is a crucial epigenetic process which helps control gene transcription activity in eukaryotes.  dna methylation and chromatin structure are two modes of epigenetic control of genome function.  dna methylation (the addition of a methyl group to a cytosine) is an important epigenetic event in mammalian cells because it plays a key role in regulating gene expression.  methylation of cytosine residues in dna, the best studied epigenetic modification, is associated with gene transcription and nuclear organization, and ultimately the function of a cell.  dna methylation is a major mechanism involved in the epigenetic state of a cell.  epigenetic modification, as typified by cytosine methylation, is a key aspect of gene regulation that affects many biological processes.  dna methylation is an important epigenetic marker associated with gene expression regulation in eukaryotes.  dna methylation is a mechanism of epigenetic modification in eukaryotic organisms.  methylation of cytosine in cpg sequences of the dna in mammalian cells is an epigenetic feature regulated very exactly that bears importance for events like gene expression, dna replication, transcription and genetic imprinting.  dna methylation is associated with a number of biological phenomena, and plays crucial roles in epigenetic regulation of eukaryotic gene expression.  it is also suggested that dna methylation alters the mechanical properties of dna molecules, which is likely to affect epigenetic regulation.  cytosine methylation is a key mechanism of epigenetic regulation.  dna methylation is an epigenetic event that adds a methyl-group to the 5' cytosine.  generally, methylation within genes promoter inhibits regulatory protein binding and represses transcription, whereas gene body methylation is associated with actively transcribed genes.  it has been observed that the methylation status of certain cpg sites close to or within a gene can directly affect its expression, either by silencing or, in some cases, up-regulating transcription. ||| ",yes
Is DNA methylation correlated with nucleosome occupancy?,"thus, the relationship between dna methylation and nucleosome occupancy is influenced by the density of methylated cpg dinucleotides and by other epigenomic components in chromatin.  the results demonstrated that increasing methylated cpg density is correlated with nucleosome occupancy in the total genome and within nearly all subgenomic regions.  we hypothesize that the methylation-induced properties or conformational changes in dna may facilitate nucleosome formation, which provides the essential mechanism for alterations of chromatin density.  recent mapping of nucleosome positioning on several long gene regions subject to dna methylation has identified instances of nucleosome repositioning by this base modification.  additionally, outside of cpg islands, the density of cpgs within nucleosomes was shown to be important for the nucleosomal location of dna methylation with low cpg frequencies favoring linker methylation and high cpg frequencies favoring core particle methylation.  dna methylation is a potential source of disease biomarkers.  in this study, we make progress toward understanding these conflicting phenomena by implementing a bioinformatics approach that combines mnase-seq and nome-seq data and by comprehensively profiling dna methylation and nucleosome occupancy throughout the human genome.  unmethylated islands are related with transcriptionally active structure, whereas methylated dna recruits methyl-binding proteins that promotes chromatin compaction.  however, the debate on whether or not dna methylation is a reliable indicator of high nucleosome occupancy has not been settled.  methylation of cytosine residues in eukaryotic dna is common, but poorly understood.  the effects of dna methylation on transcription and chromatin structure require that nuclear factors be able to distinguish methylated and nonmethylated dna.  recent studies have revealed that local dna methylation profiles might be dictated by cis-regulatory dna sequences that mainly operate via dna-binding factors.  finally, methylation is more frequent in the presence of at repeats and cpgs separated by 10 nucleotides and lower in adjacent cpgs, probably indicating its dependence on helical formations and on the presence of nucleosome positioning-related sequences.  the evidence for an effect of cpg methylation on nucleosome formation and positioning in chromatin is reviewed here in the context of the complex sequence-structure requirements of dna wrapping around the histone octamer and the role of this epigenetic mark in gene repression.  dna methylation is an epigenetic modification that is enriched in heterochromatin but depleted at active promoters and enhancers.  features with elevated methylated cpg density such as exons, sine-alu sequences, h3k36-trimethylated peaks, and methylated cpg islands are among the highest nucleosome occupied elements in the genome, while some of the lowest occupancies are displayed by unmethylated cpg islands and unmethylated transcription factor binding sites.  variation in cytosine methylation at cpg dinucleotides is often observed in genomic regions, and analysis typically focuses on estimating the proportion of methylated sites observed in a given region and comparing these levels across samples to determine association with conditions of interest.  dna methylation is characterized by the addition of methyl groups in cytosines within cpg islands.  these results suggest that methylation increases dna rigidity in the cg context and introduces distortions into several chg and chh sequences.  the methylation frequency increases in sequences containing multiple putative eses. ||| ",yes
Is DNA polymerase θ involved in DNA repair?,"dna polymerase theta (pol θ) is an error-prone a-family polymerase that is highly conserved among multicellular eukaryotes and plays multiple roles in dna repair and the regulation of genome integrity.  dna polymerase θ (pol θ) is implicated in various cellular processes including double-strand break repair and apurinic/apyrimidinic site bypass.  dna polymerase θ (pol θ) is a multifunctional enzyme with double-strand break (dsb) repair, translesion synthesis, and lyase activities.  dna polymerase θ (polθ) is a promiscuous enzyme that is essential for the error-prone dna double-strand break (dsb) repair pathway called alternative end-joining (alt-ej).  new research shows that dna polymerase θ is a key player in parp-mediated dna damage repair and essential for the survival of cancer cells where homologous recombination is compromised.  although dna polymerase θ (pol θ) is known to carry out translesion synthesis and has been implicated in dna repair, its physiological function under normal growth conditions remains unclear.  dna polymerase θ, a protein encoded by the polq gene, is the defining factor for the dna double-strand break repair pathway known as theta-mediated end-joining (tmej).  the physiological function of the human dna polymerase θ (pol θ) is still unclear despite its in vitro translesion synthesis capacity during dna damage repair process.  polymerase theta (pol θ, gene name polq) is a widely conserved dna polymerase that mediates a microhomology-mediated, error-prone, double strand break (dsb) repair pathway, referred to as theta mediated end joining (tmej).  dna polymerase θ (polθ) is a unique a-family polymerase that is essential for alternative end-joining (alt-ej) of double-strand breaks (dsbs) and performs translesion synthesis.  dna polymerase θ (pol θ) is a multifunctional enzyme.  dna polymerase theta (pol θ) is an evolutionarily conserved protein encoded by the polq gene in mammalian genomes.  polymerase θ participates at an essential step of a dna double-strand break repair pathway able to join 5'-resected substrates by locating and pairing microhomologies present in 3'-overhanging single-stranded tails, cleaving the extraneous 3'-dna by dntp-dependent end-processing, before extending the nascent 3' end from the microhomology annealing site.  cancers with hereditary defects in homologous recombination rely on dna polymerase θ (pol θ) for repair of dna double-strand breaks.  dna polymerase θ (polθ) is a unique polymerase-helicase fusion protein that promotes microhomology-mediated end-joining (mmej) of dna double-strand breaks (dsbs).  the biological role of human dna polymerase θ (polq) is not yet clearly defined, but it has been proposed to participate in several cellular processes based on its translesion synthesis capabilities.  the polq gene encodes dna polymerase θ, a 2590 amino acid protein product harboring dna-dependent atpase, template-dependent dna polymerase, dntp-dependent endonuclease, and 5'-drp lyase functions.  here we report that a nuclease activity, which differs from the proofreading activity often associated with dna polymerases, is intrinsic to the polymerase domain of pol θ.  studies conducted in several model organisms have shown that pol θ can be utilized during dna interstrand crosslink repair and during alternative end-joining repair of double-strand breaks.  the gene encoding dna polymerase θ (polθ) was discovered over ten years ago as having a role in suppressing genome instability in mammalian cells. ||| ",yes
Is Dicer part of the RISC loading complex?,"dicer is a component of the protein machinery (the rna induced silencing complex ) which is involved in catalyzing the formation of mature micrornas from their precursors in the process of microrna biogenesis.  dicer is a member of the double-stranded (ds) rna-specific ribonuclease iii (rnase iii) family that is required for rna processing and degradation.  dicer is a specialized ribonuclease that processes double-stranded rna (dsrna) into small rna fragments about 25 nucleotides in length during the initiation phase of rna interference (rnai).  dicers are multidomain proteins, usually comprising an amino-terminal putative helicase domain, a duf283 domain (domain of unknown function), a paz domain, two rnase iii domains (rnase iiia and rnase iiib) and a dsrna-binding domain.  finally, we combine the structure of dicer with published biochemical data to propose a model for the architecture of the rna-induced silencing complex (risc)-loading complex.  it has been recently found that drosophila dicer-1 and dicer-2 are also components of sirna-dependent risc (sirisc).  dicer is one of the most important components in microrna biogenesis.  dicer or dicer-like (dcl) protein is a catalytic component involved in microrna (mirna) or small interference rna (sirna) processing pathway, whose fragment structures have been partially solved.  dicer is an enzyme of the rnase iii endoribonuclease family, which is crucial for rna interference (rnai) in eukaryotes.  dicer, a ribonuclease, is the key enzyme required for the biogenesis of micrornas and small interfering rnas and is essential for both mammalian development and cell differentiation.  like most members of the rnase iii family, dicer possesses a dsrna binding domain and cleaves long rna duplexes in vitro.  dicer is a member of the ribonuclease iii enzyme family and processes double-stranded rna into small functional rnas.  dicer, a member of the rnase iii family, is the key enzyme required for the biogenesis of micrornas and small interfering rnas.  loss of dicer1 affects different developmental processes.  recent evidence indicates that dicer may also be involved in tumourigenesis.  dicer1 is essential for retinal development and maintenance.  here we demonstrate that dsrnas undergo significant repositioning within dicer complexes following dicing.  here, we provide evidence that dicer is composed of three structurally rigid regions connected by flexible hinges and propose that conformational flexibility facilitates dsrna binding and processing.  the variation in the domain architecture of dicer among different species whilst preserving its biological dicing function is intriguing.  in organisms ranging from arabidopsis to humans, dicer requires dsrna-binding proteins (dsrbps) to carry out its roles in rna interference (rnai) and micro-rna (mirna) processing. ||| ",yes
Is Downs syndrome associated with decreased risk of leukemia?,"down's syndrome is relatively common, and patients who are affected have an increased risk of developing acute leukemia, but not solid tumors.  children with down's syndrome (ds) have an increased risk of developing acute lymphoblastic leukemia (all) and have a low frequency of established genetic aberrations.  patients with down syndrome (ds) and standard risk (sr) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (all-ds) are reported to have inferior event free (efs) and overall survival (os) compared to patients without ds (all-nds).  the low risk of lung cancer in individuals with down syndrome may be related to the gene-dosage effect of the extra chromosome 21.  there is epidemiologic evidence that individuals with down syndrome are at decreased risk for solid tumors including brain tumors.  the genetic disorder down syndrome is associated with a decreased susceptibility for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.  hematological and immune abnormalities occur frequently in down syndrome patients.  solid tumors have a markedly decreased incidence in individuals with down syndrome (ds), including lung cancers.  in down syndrome, the incidence of solid tumors including lung cancer is considerably lower than that of the general population.  this supports the hypothesis that some genes whose expression is increased on the extra copy of chromosome 21 function as tumor suppressor genes and that they contribute to the reduced tumor incidence in individuals with down syndrome.  the incidence of solid tumors is low in individuals with down syndrome (trisomy 21), suggesting the presence of one or more tumor suppressor genes on chromosome 21.  we evaluated, in a preclinical setting, the impact of a down syndrome-like hematological/immune phenotype on atherosclerosis susceptibility.  studies performed in larger patient populations have shown that solid tumors, including lymphomas, are significantly less frequent in down patients than in children and adults who are not trisomy 21-affected.testicular lymphomas are rare and extremely aggressive.  in conclusion, we have shown that providing mice with a down syndrome-like hematological profile does not change the susceptibility to atherosclerosis.  in shwachman-diamond syndrome (sds), deletion of the long arm of chromosome 20, del(20)(q), often acquired in bone marrow (bm), may imply a lower risk of developing myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukaemia (mds/aml), due to the loss of the eif6 gene.  in individuals with ds, the risk of lung cancer appears markedly lower.  the findings are consistent with a role for an additional copy of btg3 in the reduced incidence of breast cancer in individuals with down syndrome.  down syndrome comprises multiple malformations and is due to trisomy of chromosome 21.  deletion of the chromosome 21 allele may be associated with tumorigenesis of meningioma in down syndrome.  increased cancer mortality risks associated with low plasma cholesterol were not explained by the confounding effect of antioxidant vitamins, but were attributed in part to the effect of preexisting cancer. ||| ",no
Is Doxorubicin cardiotoxic?,"doxorubicin is a highly effective anticancer agent but causes cardiotoxicity in many patients.  doxorubicin (dox) is one of the most effective antitumor drugs, but its cardiotoxicity has been a major concern for its use in cancer therapy for decades.  doxorubicin (dox) is one of the most effective chemotherapeutic drugs; however, its incidence of cardiotoxicity compromises its therapeutic index.  doxorubicin (dox) is a widely administered chemotherapeutic drug and incidences of cardiotoxicity associated with its administration have been of general concern.  doxorubicin (dox), a wide-spectrum chemotherapeutic agent, is recognized to have cardiotoxic side effects when it is applied in hematological diseases and solid tumor management.  doxorubicin  is an effective anticancer agent whose major limiting side effect is cardiotoxicity.  doxorubicin (dox) is an effective chemotherapeutic agent, however, its use is limited by cardiotoxicity.  cardiotoxicity is a treatment-limiting side effect of the anticancer drug doxorubicin (dox).  doxorubicin, a highly effective anticancer drug, produces severe side effect such as cardiotoxicity, which is mainly caused by its metabolite, doxorubicinol.  doxorubicin (dox) is an effective antineoplastic agent used to treat cancers, but its use is limited as dox induces adverse cardiotoxic effects.  doxorubicin (dox, an anthracycline) is a widely used chemotherapy agent against various forms of cancer; however, it is also known to induce dose-dependent cardiotoxicity leading to adverse complications.  doxorubicin (former generic name, adriamycin), a highly effective anticancer drug, produces cardiotoxicity, which limits its therapeutic potential.  our observation that doxorubicin was more potent than doxorubicinol in inhibiting tumor cell growth in vitro suggests that the cardiotoxicity of doxorubicin is dissociable from its anticancer activity.  doxorubicin is one of the most effective anticancer drug, but its usefulness is limited by the risk of developing cardiomyopathy, cardiac dysfunction and ventricular arrhythmias.  here, we review the correlation of cardiotoxicity of doxorubicinwith its peak plasma concentration and diffusion in the heart, followed by reductive bioactivation or oxidativeinactivation.  these data demonstrate that the induction of death receptors in cardiomyocytes is likely a critical mechanism by which doxorubicin causes cardiotoxicity.  selective cardiotoxicity of doxorubicin remains a significant and dose-limiting clinical problem.  however, the mechanism of doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity is unclear.  the mechanisms of doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity remain incompletely understood.  dexrazoxane is used to protect against doxorubicin cardiotoxicity. ||| ",yes
Is Drk essential for anesthesia-resistant memory (ARM) in Drosophila?,"anesthesia-resistant memory (arm) was described decades ago, but the mechanisms that underlie this protein synthesis-independent form of consolidated memory in drosophila remain poorly understood.  long-term memory in drosophila is separable into two components: consolidated, anesthesia-resistant memory and long-lasting, protein-synthesis-dependent memory.  associative olfactory memory in drosophila has two components called labile anesthesia-sensitive memory and consolidated anesthesia-resistant memory (arm).  in drosophila, anesthesia-resistant memory (arm) and long-term memory (ltm) are genetically distinct forms of long-lasting memory that exist in parallel for at least a day after training.  in drosophila, the activation of 2 rho gtpases (rac1 and cdc42), respectively, underlies the forgetting of an early labile memory (anesthesia-sensitive memory, asm) and a form of consolidated memory (anesthesia-resistant memory, arm).  pavlovian olfactory learning in drosophila produces two genetically distinct forms of intermediate-term memories: anesthesia-sensitive memory, which requires the amnesiac gene, and anesthesia-resistant memory (arm), which requires the radish gene.  genetic studies in drosophila have revealed two separable long-term memory pathways defined as anesthesia-resistant memory (arm) and long-lasting long-term memory (lltm).  consolidated memory after olfactory learning in drosophila consists of two components, a cycloheximide-sensitive, long-term memory (ltm) and a cycloheximide-insensitive, anesthesia-resistant memory (arm).  the drosophila memory mutant radish is specifically deficient in anesthesia-resistant memory and so represents the only molecular avenue to understanding this memory component.  anesthesia-resistant memory (consolidated memory) is undetectable in radish flies 3 hr after training.  it was proposed that the drosophila amnesiac gene (amn) is required for consolidation of aversive memory in the dorsal paired medial (dpm) neurons, a pair of large neurons that broadly innervate the mushroom bodies (mb), the fly center for olfactory learning and memory (waddell et al., 2000).  this analysis provides insights into the radish-dependent arm pathway and novel transcriptional targets that may contribute to memory processing in drosophila.  in the drosophila mutant rutabaga, short-term memory is deficient and intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (camp) concentration is reduced.  its expression is required in dpm neurons for their development, and in adult mb for olfactory memory.significance statement the drosophila amnesiac gene encodes a neuropeptide whose expression was proposed to be required for consolidation of aversive memory in the dorsal paired medial (dpm) neurons, a pair of large neurons that broadly innervate the mushroom bodies (mb), the olfactory memory center.  our work demonstrated that two parallel neural pathways mediating arm consolidation in drosophila mb additively contribute to arm expression during retrieval.  in drosophila, two forms of consolidated memory have been observed.  anesthesia-resistant memory (arm) is formed after one or several consecutive training sessions whereas long-term memory (ltm) is formed only after multiple training sessions separated in time.  learning and memory are defective in the drosophila mutant rutabaga, which has a low intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (camp) concentration.  the drosophila learning mutant rutabaga is defective in short-term memory and has a reduced intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (camp) concentration.  we present evidence that drk, the drosophila ortholog of the adaptor protein grb2, is essential for arm within adult mushroom body neurons. ||| ",yes

Is EZH2 associated with prostate cancer?,"overexpression of ezh2 protein has been associated with biological malignancy of prostate cancer and several other cancers.  ezh2 has strong prognostic impact in prostate cancer and might contribute to the development of a fraction of genetically instable and particularly aggressive prostate cancers.  in the current study, we analyzed prevalence and prognostic impact of ezh2 in prostate cancer.  ezh2 promotes proliferation and invasion of prostate cancer cells, which can account for the correlation between ezh2 expression levels and an adverse prostate cancer prognosis.  ezh2 expression in prostate cancer correlates with progression to hormone-refractory and metastatic disease, but it is unknown whether ezh2 plays a specific role in the acquisition of an advanced prostate cancer phenotype.  associations between ezh2 expression in malignant and benign tissue in prostate biopsy cores and outcomes were investigated using univariate and multivariate cox regression analyses.  ezh2 knockdown also inhibited prostate cancer cell invasion.  our findings have revealed a genetic mechanism resulting in enhanced ezh2 expression during the progression of aggressive prostate cancer, with important implications for understanding how to target advanced disease where cancer progenitor cells may be critical.  ezh2 analysis might therefore be of clinical value for risk stratification of prostate cancer.  however, the question remains whether overexpression of ezh2 can initiate prostate tumourigenesis or drive tumour progression.  overexpression of the enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (ezh2) protein, a known repressor of gene transcription, has been reported to be associated with biological malignancy of prostate cancer and several other cancers.  ezh2 expression was analyzed by immunohistochemistry on a tissue microarray containing more than 12400 prostate cancer specimens.  knockdown of endogenous ezh2 reduced proliferation of androgen-responsive and androgen-independent prostate cancer cells.  ezh2 mrna expression density in the metastatic prostate cancer group was significantly higher than in the control (p=0.023) and localized prostate cancer groups (p=0.019).  ezh2 binds hnf1b locus and suppresses hnf1b expression in prostate cancer cell lines, which is further supported by the reverse correlation between ezh2 and hnf1b expression in clinical samples.  most insights into the functional role of ezh2 in prostate cancer have been gained using cell lines and ezh2 inactivation studies.  while there was no significant association between ezh2 expression and biochemical recurrence following radiotherapy, univariate analysis revealed that prostate cancer cytoplasmic and total ezh2 expression were significantly associated with metastasis development postradiotherapy (p = 0.034 and p = 0.003, respectively).  these results suggest that overexpression of ezh2 is correlated with malignant potential and poor prognosis in osccs.  ezh2 expression was investigated using immunohistochemistry in diagnostic prostate biopsies of 113 prostate cancer patients treated with radiotherapy with curative intent.  in this study, we analyzed ezh2 mrna in circulating tumor cells (ctcs) in peripheral blood as a biomarker in patients with metastatic prostate cancer. ||| ",yes
Is Enlimomab effective for stroke treatment?,"the purpose of the current clinical trial was to evaluate the use of enlimomab after ischemic stroke.  the authors conclude that anti-icam therapy with enlimomab is not an effective treatment for ischemic stroke in the model studied and, indeed, may significantly worsen stroke outcome.  a total of 625 patients with ischemic stroke were randomized to receive either enlimomab (n = 317) or placebo (n = 308) within 6 hours of stroke onset.  enlimomab, a murine intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (icam-1) antibody, reduces leukocyte adhesion and infarct size in experimental stroke studies.  enlimomab, a murine monoclonal anti-human intercellular adhesion molecule (icam)-1 antibody, had a negative outcome in a multicenter acute-stroke trial.  these observations provide several possible mechanisms for central nervous system-related clinical deterioration that occurred when enlimomab was given in acute ischemic stroke.  acute ischemic stroke patients aged >or=18 years, who could not walk unassisted, were randomized to receive enoxaparin (40 mg once daily) or ufh (5000 u every 12 hours) for 10 days.  early treatment with ebselen improved the outcome of acute ischemic stroke.  the clinical benefits associated with use of enoxaparin for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis in patients with acute ischemic stroke are not associated with poorer long-term neurological outcomes or increased rates of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage compared with ufh.  the prevention of vte after acute ischemic stroke with lmwh (prevail) study demonstrated that enoxaparin was superior to unfractionated heparin (ufh) in preventing venous thromboembolism in patients with ischemic stroke and was associated with a small but statistically significant increase in extracranial hemorrhage rates.  the aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to compare the safety and efficacy of evt with medical treatment in mild stroke patients.  endovascular treatment (et) has been proved as safety and effective in acute ischemic stroke.  edaravone, a potent antioxidant, may improve thrombolytic therapy because it benefits ischemic stroke patients on its own and mitigates adverse effects of tissue plasminogen activator (tpa) in preclinical models.  edaravone is widely used for treating ischemic stroke, but it is not still confirmed in intracerebral hemorrhage (ich) as an ideal medication targeting the brain parenchyma.  the effect of ebselen, a seleno-organic compound with antioxidant activity through a glutathione peroxidase-like action, on the outcome of acute ischemic stroke was evaluated in a multicenter, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial.  the international randomized, double-blind, evaluation in secondary stroke prevention comparing the efficacy and safety of the oral thrombin inhibitor dabigatran etexilate versus acetylsalicylic acid in patients with embolic stroke of undetermined source (re-spect esus) trial did not demonstrate superiority of dabigatran over aspirin for reduction of recurrent strokes in patients with embolic strokes of undetermined source (esus).  the embotrap stent-retriever mechanical thrombectomy device demonstrated high rates of substantial reperfusion and functional independence in patients with acute ischemic stroke secondary to large-vessel occlusions.  the free radical scavenger edaravone has been reported useful for improvement in activities of daily living and for prevention of recurrent stroke in the edaravone versus sodium ozagrel in acute noncardioembolic ischemic stroke (edo) trial.  at present, endovascular thrombectomy (evt) has been gradually became a standard therapy for stroke patients caused by emergent large-vessel occlusion (elvo).  embotrap is a novel stent retriever designed to achieve rapid and substantial flow restoration in acute ischemic stroke secondary to large-vessel occlusions. ||| ",no
Is Fanconi anemia presented as a genetically and clinically heterogeneous disease entity?,"fanconi anemia (fa), an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by a progressive pancytopenia associated with congenital anomalies and high predisposition to malignancies, is a genetically and clinically heterogeneous disease.  fanconi anemia (fa), an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by a progressive pancytopenia associated with congenital anomalies and high predisposition to malignancies, is a genetically and clinically heterogeneous disease.  fanconi anemia is a rare hereditary disease showing genetic heterogeneity due to a variety of mutations in genes involved in dna repair pathways, which may lead to different clinical manifestations.  the molecular diagnosis of fanconi anemia is relatively complex for several aspects including genetic heterogeneity with mutations in at least 16 different genes.  fanconi anemia (fa) is a genetically and phenotypically heterogeneous recessive disorder characterized by diverse congenital malformations, progressive pancytopenia, and predisposition to both hematologic malignancies and solid tumors.  fanconi anemia (fa) is a genetically and phenotypically heterogeneous recessive disorder characterized by diverse congenital malformations, progressive pancytopenia and predisposition to both hematologic malignancies and solid tumors.  fanconi anemia is genetically heterogeneous, with at least eight distinct complementation groups of fa (a, b, c, d1, d2, e, f, and g) having been defined by somatic cell fusion studies.  fanconi anemia (fa) is a genetically heterogeneous, autosomal recessive disorder characterized by a variety of congenital and skeletal malformations, progressive pancytopaenia and predisposition to malignancies.  fanconi anemia is a rare, inherited disorder characterized by bone marrow failure, congenital malformations, and cancer susceptibility.  fanconi anemia (fa) is an autosomal recessively inherited disease with diverse clinical symptoms including developmental anomalies, predisposition to neoplasia, and a deficiency of hematopoietic stem cells resulting in progressive aplastic anemia.  fanconi anemia (fa) is a pleiotropic condition with 2 characteristic phenotypic markers of hematological and cytogenetic changes.  fanconi anemia (fa) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized clinically by a progressive pancytopenia, diverse congenital abnormalities, and increased predisposition to malignancy.  fanconi anemia is an inherited disease characterized by congenital malformations, pancytopenia, cancer predisposition, and sensitivity to cross-linking agents.  fanconi anemia (fa) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by progressive pancytopaenia, a diverse assortment of congenital malformations, and a predisposition to the development of malignancies.  fanconi anemia (fa) is a rare autosomal recessive disease characterized by progressive pancytopenia, congenital malformations, and predisposition to acute myeloid leukemia.  fanconi anemia (fa) is an autosomal recessive syndrome featuring diverse symptoms including progressive bone marrow failure and early occurrence of acute myeloid leukemia.  fanconi anemia (fa) is a rare autosomal recessive disease, characterized by bone marrow failure and cancer predisposition.  fanconi anemia (fa) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by bone marrow failure, cancer susceptibility, and a variety of developmental defects.  fanconi anemia (fa) is an autosomal recessive disease characterized by pancytopenia, congenital malformation and high predisposition to developing malignancies.  fanconi's anaemia (fa) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by diverse congenital abnormalities, the development of progressive bone marrow failure, and an increased predisposition to malignancy, particularly acute leukaemia. ||| ",yes
Is Fibroblast Growth Factor 23 a phosphaturic hormone?,"fibroblast growth factor (fgf-23) is a novel phosphaturic factor.  fibroblast growth factor-23 (fgf-23) is a recently discovered phosphaturic factor.  fibroblast growth factor 23 (fgf23) has been shown to work as a phosphotropic hormone.  fibroblast growth factor 23 (fgf23) is a phosphaturic hormone produced by bone and works by binding to klotho-fgf receptor complex.  fibroblast growth factor 23 (fgf23) is a phosphaturic hormone produced by bone and exerts its function in the target organs by binding the fgf receptor (fgfr) and klotho.  while fibroblast growth factor (fgf) 23 is known as a phosphaturic factor in inherited and/or acquired hypophosphatemic disorders, it also serves an endocrine role in normal phosphate homeostasis.  fibroblast growth factor 23 (fgf-23) is a circulating factor that acts as a phosphaturic factor in the kidneys.  fibroblast growth factor 23 (fgf23) is a phosphaturic hormone that in end-stage renal disease is markedly increased in serum; however, the mechanisms responsible for this increase are unclear.  fibroblast growth factor-23 (fgf23) is a hormonal regulator of circulating phosphate and vitamin d levels.  fibroblast growth factor (fgf)23 is a hormone that regulates serum phosphate and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin d levels.  abstract background: fibroblast growth factor 23 (fgf-23), a phosphaturic peptide hormone secreted by the osteoblasts, is an important regulator of phosphorus and vitamin d metabolism.  fibroblast growth factor 23 (fgf23) is a recently characterized protein likely involved in the regulation of serum phosphate homeostasis.  fibroblast growth factor-23 (fgf-23) is a novel circulating peptide that regulates phosphorus (pi) and vitamin d metabolism, but the mechanisms by which circulating fgf-23 itself is regulated are unknown.  fibroblast growth factor 23 (fgf23) is an osteocyte and osteoblast derived peptide hormone, which requires klotho as a cofactor for its biologic actions.  subsequent studies indicated that fgf23 is a hormone regulating serum phosphate level.  high serum levels of fibroblast growth factor-23 (fgf-23) are associated with mortality in patients with esrd, but whether it still acts as a phosphaturic factor is unknown.  the discovery of fibroblast growth factor-23 (fgf-23) and the elucidation of its function as a phosphaturic and 1,25(oh)2vitd counter-regulatory hormone provides a new conceptual framework for the understanding of the pathogenesis of secondary hyperparathyroidism.  the importance of fibroblast growth factor 23 (fgf-23) in the pathogenesis of phosphate wasting disorders has been established, but controversy remains about how parathyroid hormone (pth), which also stimulates urinary phosphate excretion, regulates the circulating level of fgf-23.  fibroblast growth factor (fgf)23 was identified as a humoral factor involved in the development of several hypophosphatemic diseases.  in conclusion, pth plays a major role in the regulation of serum fgf-23 level in primary hyperparathyroidism, likely via activation of osteoblasts in bone. ||| ",yes
Is GAGA associated with nucleosome-free regions (NFR)?,"by means of its specific interaction with dna, gaga has been involved in several nuclear transactions including regulation of gene expression.  our results give support to the notion that gaga can function as a transcription activating factor.  gaga is a nuclear protein encoded by the trithorax-like gene in drosophila that is expressed in at least two isoforms generated by alternative splicing.  most nucleosomes are well-organized at the 5' ends of s. cerevisiae genes where ""-1"" and ""+1"" nucleosomes bracket a nucleosome-free promoter region (nfr).  at-rich dna is concentrated in the nucleosome-free regions (nfrs) associated with transcription start sites of most genes.  our findings suggest that many nfrs are formed and maintained by an active mechanism involving the atp-dependent removal of nucleosomes rather than a passive mechanism due to the intrinsic instability of nucleosomes on at-rich dna sequences.  tf binding occurs in nucleosome-depleted regions of dna (ndrs), which generally encompass regions with lengths similar to those protected by nucleosomes.  we tested the hypothesis that at-rich dna engenders nfr formation by virtue of its rigidity and consequent exclusion of nucleosomes.  we observed that g4s are located in gc-rich (euchromatin) regions and outside the fibrillarin-positive compartment of nucleoli.  rsc may remove nfr nucleosomes without effect on adjacent orf nucleosomes.  here we have studied the gaga(519) isoform as a transcription factor.  we present evidence for a novel 3' nfr that is present at >95% of all genes.  although the sequencing of the gtpase activating protein (gap)-related region of nf1 (nf1-grd) revealed no apparent mutation, the nf1-grd transcript (type i) and that containing an additional 63 bp insert in the center of nf1-grd (type ii) were equally expressed in most gastric cancer cells.  we found that the at-rich sequences present in many nfrs have little effect on the stability of nucleosomes.  when inactive, gasz, cftr, and cortbp2 preferentially associated with the nuclear periphery and with perinuclear heterochromatin, whereas in their actively transcribed states the gene loci preferentially associated with euchromatin in the nuclear interior.  in vivo, in drosophila sl2 cells, q-domain can transactivate reporter genes either in the form of gaga or gal4bd-q fusions, whereas a gaga mutant deleted of the q-domain cannot.  the present study was undertaken to determine the mechanism of nop25 localization in the nucleolus.  we show that xenopus oocytes and embryos contain gata-2, stored in nuclei as a non-chromatin-bound complex.  to functionally validate the putative nes motif, deletion and site-directed mutants were fused to an egfp expression vector and transfected into cos-7 cells, and the localization of the proteins was examined.  nop25 did not localize in the nucleolus by deletion of the peptide from nop25. ||| ",yes
Is Growth factor independence 1b (GFI1B) important for hematopoiesis?,"growth factor‑independent 1 (gfi1) has been reported to serve a vital role in hematopoietic development.  growth factor independence 1b (gfi1b) is a dna binding repressor of transcription with vital functions in hematopoiesis.  growth factor independence 1 (gfi1) is important for maturation of mammalian lymphocytes and neutrophils and maintenance of adult hematopoietic stem cells (hscs).  growth factor independence 1 (gfi1), a transcriptional repressor, is required for hematopoietic stem cell maintenance and self-renewal in addition to controlling differentiation and proliferation of myeloid cells.  the role of gfi1 in embryonic hematopoiesis is less well characterized.  the growth factor independence 1 (gfi1) gene was originally discovered in the hematopoietic system, where it functions as a key regulator of stem cell homeostasis, as well as neutrophil and t-cell development.  growth factor-independent 1b (gfi1b) is a transcription factor essential for the development and differentiation of erythroid and megakaryocytic lineages.  this is the case for the growth factor independent 1b (gfi1b) transcription factor, which is required for erythroid and megakaryocytic differentiation and over-expressed in leukemic patients and cell lines.  gfi1 plays important roles in hematopoiesis, in particular by regulating both the function of hematopoietic stem- and precursor cells and differentiation along myeloid and lymphoid lineages.  gfi-1b (growth factor independence-1b) gene is an erythroid-specific transcription factor, whose expression plays an essential role in erythropoiesis.  our data indicate that gfi-1b signalling is important for commitment and maturation of hematopoietic cell populations.  growth factor-independence 1b (gfi1b) is a zinc finger transcription factor essential for erythroid and megakaryocytic development.  to investigate the molecular effects of growth factor independence 1b (gfi-1b), a transcription factor essential for the development of hematopoietic cells and differentiation of erythroid and megakaryocytic lineages, the naturally gfi-1b overexpressing cell line k562 was cultured in the presence of gfi-1b target-specific small interfering rna (sirna).  gfi1b (growth factor independence 1b) is a zinc finger transcription factor essential for development of the erythroid and megakaryocytic lineages.  growth factor independence 1b (gfi1b) coordinates assembly of transcriptional repressor complexes comprised of corepressors and histone-modifying enzymes to control gene expression programs governing lineage allocation in hematopoiesis.  the growth factor independent 1 (gfi1) transcriptional regulator oncoprotein plays a crucial role in hematopoietic, inner ear, and pulmonary neuroendocrine cell development and governs cell processes as diverse as self-renewal of hematopoietic stem cells, proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation, cell fate specification, and oncogenesis.  expression of gfi (growth factor-independence)-1b, a gfi-1-related transcriptional repressor, is restricted to erythroid lineage cells and is essential for erythropoiesis.  it is known that insulin-like growth factor-1 (igf-1) also functions as a hematopoietic factor, although its direct effect on thrombopoiesis remains unclear.  together our study establishes gfi-1b as a master transcriptional repressor of adult erythropoiesis and thrombopoiesis.  gfi1b expression was increased at least threefold in patients with erythroleukaemia (p < 0.01 compared with controls) and megakaryocytic leukaemia (p < 0.05) as well as in their corresponding leukaemic cell lines hel, k562, cmk and m-07e. ||| ",yes
Is H4K20 methylation associated with DNA replication?,"h4k20 methylation is a broad chromatin modification that has been linked with diverse epigenetic functions.  the methylation state of lysine 20 on histone h4 (h4k20) has been linked to chromatin compaction, transcription, dna repair and dna replication.  histone h4 lys 20 methylation (h4k20me) has been implicated in regulating diverse processes ranging from the dna damage response, mitotic condensation, and dna replication to gene regulation.  together, these findings suggest that methylations of histone h3-k9 and k36 by clr4 and set2 are functionally linked to dna replication checkpoint via accumulation of mik1.  methylation of histone h4 at lysine 20 (k20) has been implicated in transcriptional activation, gene silencing, heterochromatin formation, mitosis, and dna repair.  histone h4 methyltransferase activity was found to be cell cycle-regulated, consistent with increased h4 lys 20 methylation at mitosis.  it seems likely that continued study of the methylation of h4k20 will yield extremely valuable insights concerning the regulation of histone modifications before and during cell division and the impact of these modifications on subsequent gene expression.  h4k20 monomethylation maintains genome integrity by regulating proper mitotic condensation, dna damage response, and replication licensing.  new h4 is methylated regardless of prior acetylation, and acetylation occurs predominantly on k20-dimethylated h4, refuting the hypothesis that k20 methylation antagonizes h4 acetylation and represses transcription epigenetically.  methylation of histone h4 lysine 20 (h4k20) has been associated with cancer.  we employed genetic, cytological, and genomic approaches to better understand the role of pr-set7 and h4k20 methylation in regulating dna replication and genome stability in drosophila cells.  several enzymes target h4k20 methylation, consistent with distinct mono-, di-, and trimethylation states controlling different biological outputs.  the molecular biology of histone h4 lysine 20 (h4k20) methylation, like many other post-translational modifications of histones, has been the subject of intensive interest in recent years.  monomethylation of h4k20 (h4k20me1) is mediated by the cell cycle-regulated histone methyltransferase pr-set7.  while there is an emerging consensus linking h4k20me1, h4k20me2, and h4k20me3 to transcription, repair, and constitutive heterochromatin, respectively, the specific details of these associations and the biological mechanisms by which the methylated histones are introduced and function are now the subject of active investigation.  monomethylation of h4k20 has been implicated in regulating diverse biological processes including the dna damage response.  metabolic labeling and top-down mass spectrometry reveal that newly synthesized h4 is progressively methylated at k20 during the g(2), m, and g(1) phases of the cell cycle in a process that is largely inescapable and irreversible.  in previous analyses of histone methylation dynamics in mid-gestation mouse embryos, we documented marked changes in h4k20 methylation during cell differentiation.  approximately 98% of new h4 becomes dimethylated within two to three cell cycles, and k20 methylation turnover in vivo is undetectable.  methylation of histone h4 on lysine 20 plays critical roles in chromatin structure and function via mono- (h4k20me1), di- (h4k20me2), and trimethyl (h4k20me3) derivatives. ||| ",yes
Is HER2 active only when it dimerizes?,"although it is known that her2 dimerization involves a specific region of its extracellular domain, the so-called ""dimerization arm"", the mechanism of dimerization inhibition remains uncertain.  the dimerization of her2 leads to the autophosphorylation of tyrosine residues within its cytoplasmic domain, resulting in hyperactivation of several downstream signal transduction pathways that play an important role in tumorigenesis, cancer aggressiveness and cell proliferation.  hence, her2 molecules can undergo spontaneous dimerization, autophosphorylation and activation of downstream signaling pathways especially under conditions of overexpression, a commonly encountered phenomenon in breast cancer.  this paper is aimed to describe consequences of possible dimerization modes between ligand binding her1 and ligand free her2 receptors on cellular membrane.  our results support and advance the knowledge on the already described trastuzumab effect on blocking her2 dimerization through synergistic inhibition and/or steric hindrance.  in this study, we sought to investigate the mechanism by which her2 musters signaling and transformation potency.  however, uncovering how antibody interactions lead to inhibition of her2 dimerization is of key importance in understanding its role in tumour progression and therapy.  human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (her2) is a tyrosine kinase family protein receptor that is known to undergo heterodimerization with other members of the family of epidermal growth factor receptors (egfr) for cell signaling.  in a broad range of human carcinomas gene amplification leads to her2 overexpression, which has been proposed to cause spontaneous dimerization and activation in the absence of ligand.  this makes her2 attractive as a therapeutic target.  conformational changes in the her2 activation loop, as measured by changes in carboxyl group labeling, required both dimerization and nucleotide binding but did not require activation loop phosphorylation at tyr-877.  human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (her2) is a member of the epidermal growth factor receptor (her) family that is involved in various biological processes such as cell proliferation, survival, differentiation, migration and invasion.  ligand-dependent heterodimerization between her2 and another her family member, her1, her3 or her4, activates the her2 signaling pathway.  in normal biological systems, her2 functions as a co-receptor for a multitude of epidermal growth factor-like ligands that bind and activate other her family members.  in tumors, high expression of her2 can lead to many her2:her2 homodimers and increased cell growth that contributes to a poor prognosis.  we have detected the her2 extracellular domain homodimer in solution.  cells with her2/neu molecules on their surface can react to moderate or even low her1 ligand exposure through formation of her2:her1-ligand dimers, making them more sensitive to growth stimulation by egf or other ligands without the ""all or none"" threshold in cell growth stimulation.  these findings indicate that her2 is an appropriate target for tumor-specific therapies.  under physiologic levels of expression, her2 heterodimerizes with other members of the egf receptor/her/erbb family, and the her2-her3 dimer forms one of the most potent oncogenic receptor pairs.  the heterodimerization of egfr with her2 induces a more potent activation of egfr tk than does egfr homodimerization. ||| ",yes
Is Hepatic mesenchymal hamartoma usually a malignant tumor?,"hepatic mesenchymal hamartoma is a rare benign tumor.  hepatic mesenchymal hamartoma is a hamartomatous growth of mesenchymal tissue in the liver of uncertain etiology.  mesenchymal hamartoma of the liver (mhl) is a benign and rare hepatic lesion, with an uncertain etiology and a potential for developing into an undifferentiated distant embryonal sarcoma after an incomplete resection.  mesenchymal hamartoma (mh) is a rare liver lesion of infancy.  mesenchymal hamartoma (mh) of the liver is an uncommon benign lesion related to ductal plate malformation.  mesenchymal hamartoma of the liver is a rare benign tumor of childhood which has been confused with various other benign liver lesions, particularly vascular hamartomas which are mesodermal but not mesenchymal.  hepatic mesenchymal hamartoma is characterized by proliferation of variably myxomatous mesenchyme and malformed bile ducts.  mesenchymal hamartoma is a benign hamartomatous lesion with unknown histogenesis.  mesenchymal hamartoma of the liver (mhl) is a rare benign lesion occurring primarily in the pediatric population.  we report the case of a mesenchymal hamartoma of the left liver in an 18-month-old girl, with a rough evolution and a literature review.  because of recent reports of specific translocations involving chromosome 19 in mesenchymal hamartomas and certain ultrastructural and histologic features suggesting a relationship between mesenchymal hamartoma and undifferentiated (embryonal) sarcoma of the liver, some have speculated that mesenchymal hamartoma may be a neoplastic lesion with uncertain malignant potential.  mesenchymal hamartoma of the liver is a rare lesion seen predominantly in childhood, which is believed to be either a developmental anomaly or reactive process.  mesenchymal hamartoma of the liver (mhl) is a rare lesion occurring mainly in infants and children.  hepatic mesenchymal hamartoma (hmh) is a hamartomatous growth of the mesenchymal tissue in the liver, which is of an uncertain aetiology.  we report an unusual case of a cystic mesenchymal hamartoma of liver in an 81-year-old elderly male.  hepatic mesenchymal hamartoma is characterized by the variable proliferation of the myxomatous mesenchyme and the malformed bile ducts.  we present an unusual case of a fetal abdominal cyst, later diagnosed histopathologically to be mesenchymal hamartoma of liver.  the finding of aneuploidy in mesenchymal hamartoma, in conjunction with the reported cytogenetic abnormalities, suggests that mesenchymal hamartoma may be a true neoplasm and not a developmental anomaly or reactive process.  the authors retrospectively examined mesenchymal hamartomas from eight children and evaluated the clinicopathologic features and the ploidy of the lesions.  hepatic angiomyolipomas are a rare, benign group of mesenchymal tumors in the liver. ||| ",no
Is Hirschsprung disease one of the characteristics of the Mowat-Wilson syndrome?,"mowat wilson syndrome (mws) is an uncommon association of hirschsprung's disease (hscr).  mowat-wilson syndrome (mws) is a syndromic form of hirschsprung disease that is characterized by variable degrees of intellectual disability, characteristic facial dysmorphism, and a diverse set of other congenital malformations due to haploinsufficiency of zeb2.  mowat-wilson syndrome (mws) is a rare autosomal dominant syndrome characterized by distinctive facial features, congenital heart defects, hirschsprung disease, genitourinary anomalies, various structural brain anomalies, and intellectual disability.  hirschsprung's disease (hscr) is cited as a classical component in the constellation of features found in children with mowat-wilson syndrome (mws), which is caused by a mutation of the zeb2 gene.  mowat-wilson syndrome (mws) is a mental retardation syndrome associated with distinctive facial features, microcephaly, epilepsy, and a variable spectrum of congenital anomalies, including hirschsprung disease (hscr), agenesis of the corpus callosum, genitourinary abnormalities, and congenital heart disease.  mowat-wilson syndrome is a mental retardation-multiple congenital anomaly syndrome characterized by a typical facies, developmental delay, epilepsy, and variable congenital malformations, including hirschsprung disease, urogenital anomalies, congenital heart disease, and agenesis of the corpus callosum.  these variations probably contribute to the clinical features of the mowat wilson phenotype in hirschsprung's disease but should be confirmed in further research.  sip1 mutation in humans was shown to cause mowat-wilson syndrome, a syndromic form of hirschprung's disease.  mowat-wilson syndrome (mws) is a recently delineated mental retardation (mr)-multiple congenital anomaly syndrome, characterized by typical facies, severe mr, epilepsy, and variable congenital malformations, including hirschsprung disease (hscr), genital anomalies, congenital heart disease (chd), and agenesis of the corpus callosum (acc).  mws has been reported in association with hirschsprung disease (hscr).  individuals with mowat-wilson syndrome (mws; omim#235730) have characteristic facial features, a variety of congenital anomalies such as hirschsprung disease, and intellectual disabilities caused by mutation or deletion of zeb2 gene.  mowat-wilson syndrome is a genetic condition characterized by a recognizable facial phenotype in addition to moderate to severe cognitive disability with severe speech impairment and variable multiple congenital anomalies.  hirschsprung's disease associated with mws is a severe condition.  mowat-wilson syndrome is a rare congenital syndrome involving multiple system abnormalities.  patients with zinc finger homeo box 1b (zfhx1b) mutations or deletions develop multiple congenital anomalies including hirschsprung disease, known as mowat-wilson syndrome (mws).  mowat-wilson syndrome (mws) is a developmental disorder presenting with mental retardation, delayed motor development, and a wide spectrum of clinical features.  we demonstrate that there is a specific clinical entity with a recognizable facial gestalt, mental retardation and variable mcas which we propose be called the ""mowat-wilson syndrome.""  hirschsprung's disease is present in approximately 45% of patients diagnosed with mws.  hirschsprung disease is associated with this syndrome with a prevalence between 43 and 57%.  mowat wilson syndrome (mws) is a complex genetic disorder due to mutation or deletion of the zeb2 gene (zfhx1b), including multiple clinical features. ||| ",yes
Is JTV519 (K201) a potential drug for the prevention of arrhythmias?,"k201 (jtv519) is a newly developed 1,4-benzothiazepine drug with antiarrhythmic and cardioprotective properties.  jtv-519 had significant protective effects on atrial fibrillation in the canine sterile pericarditis model, mainly by increasing effective refractory period, suggesting that it may have potential as a novel antiarrhythmic agent for atrial fibrillation.  k201 (jtv519), a benzothiazepine derivative, has been shown to possess anti-arrhythmic and cardioprotective properties, but the mechanism of its action is both complex and controversial.  the drug k201 (jtv-519) increases inotropy and suppresses arrhythmias in failing hearts, but the effects of k201 on normal hearts is unknown.  jtv-519 significantly decreased the mean number of sustained atrial fibrillation episodes (from 4.2 +/- 2.9 to 0 +/- 0, p < 0.01).  here, we assess whether the new cardioprotective agent jtv519 can correct it in tachycardia-induced hf.  k201 (jtv519) is a 1,4-benzothiazepine derivative that exhibits a strong cardioprotective action and acts as a multiple-channel blocker, including as a k+ channel blocker.  jtv-519 is a 1,4-benzothiazepine derivative with multichannel effects that inhibits ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum and stabilizes the closed state of the ryanodine receptor, preventing myocardial damage and the induction of arrhythmias during ca2+ overload.  the aim of this study was to investigate the potential protective effect of jtv519 on myocardium subjected to prolonged ischemia and the underlying mechanism of such protection.  kv1.5 potassium channel is an efficacious and safe therapeutic target for the treatment of atrial fibrillation (af), the most common arrhythmia that threatens human.  a newly synthesized benzothiazepine derivative, jtv-519 (jt) has been reported to be cardioprotective.  we investigated the antiarrhythmic effects of jtv-519 on atrial fibrillation/flutter in the canine sterile pericarditis model.  in conclusion, jtv519 is a novel pharmacological agent that has been demonstrated for the first time to have clinical potential for the treatment of acute coronary syndrome by its efficacy in administration at the time of reperfusion, by its suppression of reperfusion-related intracellular ca2+ overload with no significant interaction with i(ca), and by its subsequent ability of strong myocardial protection.  a new cardioprotective drug, jtv-519, blocks na+ current and inwardly rectifying k+ current and inhibits ca2+ current.  jtv519 is know to protect cardiomyocytes from calcium overloading-induced damage.  recently, k201 has also been shown to have activities indicated for treatment of atrial fibrillation, ventricular fibrillation, heart failure and ischemic heart disease, including action as a multiple-channel blocker, inhibition of diastolic ca(2+) release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, suppression of spontaneous ca(2+) sparks and ca(2+) waves, blockage of annexin v and provision of myocardial protection, and improvement of norepinephrine-induced diastolic dysfunction.  activating ik1 channels is considered to be a promising antiarrhythmic strategy.  inhibition of ik1 could offer a useful antiarrhythmic strategy against fibrillatory arrhythmias.  as an adjunct to cardioplegia, jtv519 showed a significant protective effect on myocardium undergoing 6 hours of ischemia.  zacopride has been identified as a selective ik1 channel agonist and can suppress triggered arrhythmias. ||| ",yes
Is K-63 linked protein ubiquitination related to proteasomal degradation?,"in eukaryotic cells, ubiquitination of proteins leads to their degradation by the 26s proteasome.  here, we report that k63 ubiquitylation plays a critical role in proteasome-mediated substrate degradation by serving as a ""seed"" for k48/k63 branched ubiquitin chains.  the 26s proteasome mediates degradation of ubiquitin-conjugated proteins.  ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation is an important mechanism to control protein load in the cells.  in particular, k48 ubiquitin linkage targets proteins for degradation, whereas k63 ubiquitin linkage plays a nondegradative role.  this activation enhances the selectivity of the 26s proteasome for ubiquitinated proteins and links their deubiquitination to their degradation.  conventional lys48-linked poly-ubiquitination leads to the degradation of specific proteins through 26s proteasomes, while lys63-linked polyubiquitination appears to regulate protein activities in a non-proteolytic manner.  proteins that are destined for proteasome-mediated degradation are usually tagged with a chain of ubiquitin linked via lysine (k) 48 that targets them to the proteolytic machinery.  by virtue of its apparent dissociation from the proteasome, we have originally proposed that k63-linked ubiquitination may be involved in cargo diversion during proteasomal stress and accordingly, in the biogenesis of inclusion bodies associated with neurodegenerative diseases.  the ubiquitin proteasome pathway is responsible for most of the protein degradation in mammalian cells.  in recent years, several ubiquitin-like proteins have been isolated, but it is uncertain whether their roles are associated with protein degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome system.  abnormal proteins and regulators of many processes, are targeted for degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome system.  targeted protein degradation is largely performed by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, in which substrate proteins are marked by covalently attached ubiquitin chains that mediate recognition by the proteasome.  these results reveal a role for k63 chains as a substrate-specific mark for proteasomal degradation involved in regulating cell fate.  the role of lys-63 ubiquitin chains in targeting proteins for proteasomal degradation is still obscure.  although the role of lysine-48 (k48) polyubiquitination in proteasome-mediated degradation is fairly well characterized, much less is understood about the other types of ubiquitin chains and proteasome-independent functions.  proteolysis by the ubiquitin-proteasome system is considered to play a pathological role in several degenerative diseases that involve ubiquitinated inclusion bodies.  however, recent studies indicate that proteasome function is also tightly regulated and determines whether a ubiquitylated protein is destroyed or deubiquitylated and survives longer.  we systematically compared proteasomal processing of lys-63 ubiquitin chains with that of the canonical proteolytic signal, lys-48 ubiquitin chains.  this important cellular process is partly regulated by the ubiquitin-proteasome system through posttranslational modification by the conjugation of ubiquitin chains to proteins targeted for degradation by proteasomes. ||| ",no
Is Kanzaki disease associated with deficiency in alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase?,"kanzaki disease (omim#104170) is attributable to a deficiency in alpha-n-acetylgalactosaminidase (alpha-naga; e.c.3.2.1.49), which hydrolyzes galnacalpha1-o-ser/thr.  alpha-n-acetylgalactosaminidase (alpha-naga) deficiency (schindler/kanzaki disease) is a clinically and pathologically heterogeneous genetic disease with a wide spectrum including an early onset neuroaxonal dystrophy (schindler disease) and late onset angiokeratoma corporis diffusum (kanzaki disease).  these data suggest that a prototype of alpha-naga deficiency in kanzaki disease and factors other than the defect of alpha-naga may contribute to severe neurological disorders, and kanzaki disease is thought to be caused by a single enzyme deficiency.  assays of each of these substrates with fibroblast homogenates of the patients demonstrated the profound deficiency of alpha-n-acetylgalactosaminidase activity compared with controls.  alpha-n-acetylgalactosaminidase deficiency in intact cells was confirmed by tlc analyses, which showed impaired glycolipid modification in cell extracts obtained following addition of forssman gsl and c6-nbd-lyso-forssman gl to the culture media of fibroblasts from the patients.  alpha-n-acetylgalactosaminidase (2-acetamido-2-deoxy-alpha-d-galactoside acetamidodeoxy-galactohydrolase, naga; ec 3.2.1.49) deficiency is a recently recognized autosomal recessive lysosomal disease.  alpha-n-acetylgalactosaminidase (alpha-naga) deficiency is a rare hereditary lysosomal storage disease, and only three alpha-naga-deficient patients with angiokeratoma corporis diffusum (kanzaki) have been described.  human alpha-n-acetylgalactosaminidase (alpha-galnac, e.c.  alpha-n-acetylgalactosaminidase (alpha-naga) deficiency with angiokeratoma corporis diffusum (akcd) is one of the lysosomal storage diseases.  this neurologic disease results from a defect in the lysosomal α-n-acetylgalactosaminidase (α-nagal) enzyme.  deficient activity of lysosomal alpha-n-acetylgalactosaminidase represents a recently recognized lysosomal disorder whose neurologic manifestation in infancy is infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy.  the inherited human disorders sialidosis and galactosialidosis are the result of deficiencies of glycoprotein-specific alpha-neuraminidase (acylneuraminyl hydrolase, ec 3.2.1.18; sialidase) activity.  the deficient activity of this enzyme results in schindler disease, an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by the increased urinary excretion of glycopeptides and oligosaccharides containing alpha-n-acetylgalactosaminyl moieties.  kanzaki disease has the same enzyme defect as schindler disease, but the manifestations are quite different.  immunocytochemical analysis revealed that the main lysosomal accumulated material in cultured fibroblasts from patients with kanzaki disease is tn-antigen.  angiokeratoma corporis diffusum with glycopeptiduria is a recently recognized inborn error of glycoprotein catabolism resulting from the deficient activity of human alpha-n-acetylgalactosaminidase (e.c.  schindler disease is a lysosomal storage disorder caused due to deficiency or defective activity of alpha-n-acetylgalactosaminidase (α-naga).  inherited deficiency of sialidase results in sialidosis or galactosialidosis, both severe metabolic disorders associated with lysosomal storage of oligosaccharides and glycopeptides.  schindler disease is a recently recognized infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy resulting from the deficient activity of the lysosomal hydrolase, alpha-n-acetylgalctosaminidase (alpha-galnac).  schindler/kanzaki disease is an inherited metabolic disease with no current treatment options. ||| ",yes
Is Kummell’s disease an avascular necrosis of the vertebral body?,"kummell's disease is an avascular necrosis of the vertebral body, secondary to a vertebral compression fracture.  kummell disease, or avascular necrosis of a vertebral body, presents as vertebral osteonecrosis typically affecting a thoracic vertebra with compression deformity, intravertebral vacuum cleft, and exaggerated kyphosis weeks to months after a minor traumatic injury.  kummell disease is described as avascular necrosis of a vertebral body that occurred in a delayed fashion after a minor trauma.  kummell's disease is a rare spinal disorder characterized as avascular necrosis of a vertebral body occurring in a delayed fashion after minor trauma.  kummell disease is defined as avascular necrosis of vertebra, occurs after the delayed posttraumatic osteoporotic vertebral collapse, and mainly occurs in adults older than 50 years of age.  kummel disease is the eponym for avascular necrosis of the vertebral body after a vertebral compression fracture.  kummell's disease is a spinal disorder characterized by delayed post-traumatic collapse of a vertebral body with avascular necrosis.  kümmell's disease is defined as avascular osteonecrosis and occurs after delayed posttraumatic vertebral collapse.  avascular necrosis of a vertebral body, a relatively uncommon entity, is caused by malignancy, infection, radiation, systemic steroid treatment, trauma, and the like.1 vertebral osteonecrosis induced by trauma is called kvmell's disease, because it was initially described by hermann kvmell of germany in 1891.2 this paper reported a young female with posttraumatic vertebral osteonecrosis and analyzed the causes.  kummell's disease (kd) is a delayed post-traumatic avascular osteonecrosis of the vertebral body secondary to a vertebral compression fracture that can present with back pain.  kümmell's disease is the current eponym of avascular osteonecrosis (avn) of a vertebral body leading to a delayed non-healing vertebral compression fracture (vcf) and thus pseudo-arthrosis.  vertebral osteonecrosis, also known as kümmell's disease, is a disorder resulting in non-consolidation of a vertebral fracture caused by ischaemia.  kummell's disease is a post-traumatic vertebral body collapse.  kümmell's disease (kd) is a rare clinical entity and includes patients, who after a trivial trauma and an asymptomatic period, develop a progressive vertebral body collapse and a painful  kyphosis.  kummell's disease is a delayed vertebral collapse fracture caused by posttraumatic osteonecrosis.  kummell disease (kd) is a rare cause of vertebral fracture due to osteonecrosis.  kummell's disease, caused by osteonecrosis of the vertebral body, is a cause of vertebral collapse.  kummell's disease is a rare, delayed posttraumatic collapse of a vertebral body that can occur several months or even years after an osteoporotic compression fracture.  the aim of this article is to carry out an international literature review regarding kummell's disease, addressing its physiopathology, histopathology, clinical presentation, radiological characteristics and treatment modalities; at the same time, the literature is updated through the description of a new and interesting case, symbol of the pathology long-term potential complications, if not diagnosed and therefore not suitably treated.  we report a case with classic clinical findings and imaging features of kummell's disease. ||| ",yes
Is LDB1-mediated enhancer looping dependent on cohesin?,"the ldb1 complex mediates enhancer-gene interactions at the β-globin locus through ldb1 self-interaction.  recent experiments suggest that the formation of loops might be mediated by loop extrusion factor proteins such as cohesin.  these results uncouple enhancer-promoter looping from nuclear migration and transcription activation and reveal new roles for ldb1 in these processes.  our findings establish ldb1 as a critical effector of gata1-mediated loop formation and indicate that chromatin looping causally underlies gene regulation.  further, cas9-directed tethering of mutant ldb1 to the β-globin promoter forced lcr loop formation in the absence of mediator or cohesin occupancy.  both ldb1 and ctcf are required for enhancer-car2 looping, and the domain of ldb1 contacted by ctcf is necessary to rescue car2 transcription in ldb1-deficient cells.  here we show that ldb1 controls gene expression at multiple levels.  thus, lineage specific factors largely mediate enhancer-promoter looping in erythroid cells independent of mediator and cohesin.  moreover, encode data and our chromatin immunoprecipitation results indicate that cohesin is almost completely absent from validated and predicted ldb1-regulated erythroid enhancer-gene pairs.  ldb1 (lim-domain-binding 1) is a cofactor that participates in formation of transcriptional regulatory complexes involving transcription factors containing lim domains as well as other factors.  we find that an ldb1-bound enhancer upstream of carbonic anhydrase 2 (car2) activates its expression by interacting directly with ctcf at the gene promoter.  chromatin loops juxtapose distal enhancers with active promoters, but their molecular architecture and relationship with transcription remain unclear.  promoter-tethered ldb1 interacted with endogenous ldb1 complexes at the lcr to form a chromatin loop, causing recruitment and phosphorylation of rna polymerase ii.  to separate the roles of ldb1 and mediator in lcr looping, we expressed a looping-competent but transcription-activation deficient form of ldb1 in ldb1 knock down cells: lcr/β-globin proximity was restored without mediator core occupancy.  mechanistic studies in erythroid cells indicate that ldb1, as part of a gata1/tal1/lmo2 complex, brings erythroid-expressed genes into proximity with enhancers for transcription activation.  genome-wide studies and crispr/cas9 genome editing indicate that ldb1-ctcf enhancer looping underlies activation of a substantial fraction of erythroid genes.  these results implicate ldb1 as a factor that facilitates nuclear relocation for transcription activation.  these findings provide evidence that modification of lys134 can play a major role in regulating ldb1 expression.  we show that the ldb1 dimerization domain (dd) is necessary and, when fused to lmo2, sufficient to completely restore lcr-promoter looping and transcription in ldb1-depleted cells.  remarkably, targeting ldb1 or only its self-association domain to the β-globin promoter substantially activated β-globin transcription in the absence of gata1. ||| ",no
Is LPS a microbial product?,"lipopolysaccharide (lps) is the major component of the outer leaflet of the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria.  lipopolysaccharide (lps) is the major component of the outer leaflet of the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria.  lipopolysaccharide (lps) is an integral part of the outer cell membrane complex of gram-negative bacteria.  lipopolysaccharide (lps) is an endotoxin released from the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria during infections.  bacterial lipopolysaccharide (lps, endotoxin) is the major constituent of the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria.  lipopolysaccharides (lps), also known as lipoglycans or endotoxins, form part of the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria.  endotoxic lipopolysaccharide (lps) is a major constituent of the outer membrane of the gram-negative microbe.  lipopolysaccharide (lps) is a bacterial endotoxin which can participate in the induction of inflammatory responses.  these results indicate that e. coli lps preparations contain lps-mimetic tlr2-stimulatory substances which differ from bacterial lipopeptides or peptidoglycan.  following its release from the bacterium, lps serves as a potent proinflammatory stimulus by interacting with humoral and cellular mediator systems to stimulate production of an array of inflammatory molecules.  these data also suggest that although lps is generally considered a bacterial component that alerts the host to infection, lps from p. gingivalis may selectively modify the host response as a means to facilitate colonization.  lipopolysaccharide (lps), a highly conserved component of the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria, stimulates macrophages to release various cytokine and eicosanoid mediators of the immune response.  although some activities of lps are shared by other bacterial components, for half a century lps has been regarded as unique in displaying many pathophysiological activities.  although highly conserved, lps contains important structural differences among different bacterial species that can significantly alter host responses.  it have been reported that lps may play a role in the outer membrane of bacteria similar to that of cholesterol in eukaryotic plasma membranes.  lipopolysaccharide (lps), the major component of the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria may activate blood platelets.  lipopolysaccharide (lps) preparations are known to often contain substances which activate cells through toll-like receptor 2 (tlr2), and it is suspected that bacterial lipoproteins are responsible for this activation.  lipopolysaccharide (lps) is a key inflammatory mediator.  the question was asked (i) by using isolated lps from a series of salmonella mutants having progressively less polysaccharide attached to the lipid a portion of the molecule and (ii) by using whole bacteria expressing alternatively the smooth or rough lps phenotype.  the lipid a portion of the lipopolysaccharide (lps) molecule of gram-negative bacteria has the ability to turn on the production of tumor necrosis factor (tnf) in macrophage cells. ||| ",yes
Is Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome usually diagnosed in older adults?,"management of lennox-gastaut syndrome (lgs) in adulthood can be particularly challenging.  we describe the clinical features and outcome in patients with late-onset lennox-gastaut syndrome (lgs).  the lennox-gastaut syndrome is an age-specific disorder, characterised by epileptic seizures, a characteristic electroencephalogram (eeg), psychomotor delay and behaviour disorders.  the lennox-gastaut syndrome is an age-specific disorder, characterised by epileptic seizures, a characteristic electroencephalogram (eeg), psychomotor delay and personality disorders.  although lennox-gastaut syndrome (lgs) typically begins during childhood, it frequently persists through adolescence and on into adulthood.  lennox-gastaut syndrome (lgs) is a severe age-dependent epileptic encephalopathy usually with onset between 1 and 8 years of age.  lennox-gastaut syndrome (lgs) is a rare, age-related syndrome, characterized by multiple seizure types, a specific electro-encephalographic pattern, and mental regression.  the variable presentation and progression of lennox-gastaut syndrome (lgs) can make it difficult to recognize, particularly in adults.  the aim of this study was to describe the clinical and eeg characteristics of a group of adults with lennox-gastaut syndrome.  the lennox-gastaut syndrome (lgs) is an age-specific disorder, characterised by epileptic seizures, a characteristic electroencephalogram (eeg), psychomotor delay and behavioural disorder.  lennox-gastaut syndrome (lgs) is a severe epileptic encephalopathy with childhood onset that usually continues through adolescence and into adulthood.  although lennox-gastaut syndrome is commonly characterised by a triad of signs, which include multiple seizure types, slow spike-wave complexes on electroencephalographic (eeg) recordings, and impairment of cognitive function, there is debate with regard to the precise limits, cause, and diagnosis of the syndrome.  our observations confirm the poor outcome of lennox-gastaut syndrome through adulthood, regardless of age at seizure onset, etiology, and history of previous west syndrome.  distinguishing adult patients with lennox-gastaut syndrome from those with dravet syndrome is challenging.  lennox-gastaut syndrome (lgs) is a severe epileptic condition characterized by multiple seizure types including tonic seizures, slow spike-and-wave discharges on electroencephalography (eeg), and cognitive impairment.  the lennox-gastaut syndrome (lgs) is a severe epileptic disorder, characterized by developmental delay, typical electroencephalographic pattern and poor control of seizures.  lennox-gastaut syndrome (lgs) is a chronic and severe form of epilepsy characterized by intractable seizures, cognitive impairment, and abnormal electroencephalogram findings with slow spike-wave complexes.  we identified 38 (22 females, 16 males) patients with lgs older than age 18years at their last evaluation, with mean age of 43.3±10.6years.  lennox-gastaut syndrome is one of the most severe epileptic encephalopathies of childhood onset.  adult patients evaluated between january 1, 2000, and march 1, 2017, who presented with onset of lgs ≥10 years were identified. ||| ",no
Is Loss of function one of the cardinal signs of inflammation?,"the classic clinical signs that characterize inflammation are heat, redness, swelling, pain, and loss of function.  the chronic inflammatory state at old age may contribute to the pathophysiology of or reflect chronic conditions resulting in loss of physical and mental functioning.  inflammation is one of the cardinal clinical signs of rheumatic disease, although the pathogenesis of inflammation may differ from one such disease to another.  measurement of inflammation consists, fundamentally, of quantifying the classic symptoms of pain, swelling, heat, redness and limitation of movement.  we tested the hypothesis that a decline in lung function within the normal range may be associated with a systemic subclinical inflammation.  uncontrolled or non-resolving inflammation underpins a range of disease states including rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease and atherosclerosis.  clinically, dysregulated inflammation by excessive cytokine production due to loss of reactive oxygen species production is suggested as a cause of noninfectious inflammatory problems such as chronic granulomatous disease colitis.  in all these diseases the adverse outcomes are related to the degree of the inflammatory response and the duration of the high inflammatory situation.  these results indicate that systemic inflammation may be linked to early perturbations of pulmonary function.  disproportionate systemic inflammation in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd) is associated with declining lung functions and comorbidities.  disproportionate systemic inflammation in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd) is associated with declining lung functions and comorbidities.  increased levels of systemic markers of inflammation have been reported in patients with impaired lung function due to obstructive or restrictive lung disease.  currently, inflammation is associated with adverse symptoms related to the stimulation of nerve fibers that may lead to pain.  inflammation is the localized, protective response of the body to injury or infection.  even if inflammation is not a primary causative process, its presence may contribute to the continued loss of cns neurons.  chronic immune-mediated rheumatic diseases are characterized by inflammatory signs and symptoms, damage to joints, or spine and physical disability.  the purpose of this study was to examine whether inflammation precedes depressive symptoms and cognitive decline in old age, and to identify specific inflammatory pathways herein.  our findings show that in old age inflammatory processes contribute to the development of depressive symptoms but not cognitive decline.  chronic persistent inflammation of ra often leads to joint destruction, deformity and limitation of function, which ultimately results in significant deterioration of quality of life (qol).  increasing evidence indicates that inflammation is involved in the pathogenesis of many neurological, particularly neurodegenerative diseases. ||| ",yes
Is Lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) a critical regulator of hematopoiesis?,"lysine-specific demethylase 1 (lsd1) is a histone modifier for transcriptional repression involved in the regulation of hematopoiesis.  here, we describe that lysine-specific demethylase 1 (lsd1/kdm1a), which demethylates histone h3 on lys4 or lys9 (h3k4/k9), is an indispensible epigenetic governor of hematopoietic differentiation.  lysine-specific demethylase 1 (lsd1) has been identified and biochemically characterized in epigenetics; however, the pathological roles of its dysfunction in mantle cell lymphoma (mcl) and t-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia remain to be elucidated.  lysine-specific demethylase 1 (lsd1), which has been considered as a potential therapeutic target in human cancer, has been known to regulate many biological functions through its non-histone substrates.  lysine-specific demethylase 1 (lsd1) downregulates eukaryotic gene activity by demethylating mono- and dimethylated lys4 in histone h3.  lysine-specific demethylase 1 (lsd1) functions as a transcriptional coregulator by modulating histone methylation.  lysine-specific demethylase 1(lsd1), the first identified histone demethylase, plays an important role in the epigenetic regulation of gene activation and repression.  lysine-specific demethylase 1 (lsd1) is a histone demethylase that participates in transcriptional repression or activation.  the lysine-specific demethylase 1 (lsd1), a component of several histone deacetylase complexes, plays an important role in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation.  integrative genomic analysis, combining global occupancy of lsd1, genome-wide analysis of its substrates h3k4 monomethylation and dimethylation, and gene expression profiling, reveals that lsd1 represses hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (hspc) gene expression programs during hematopoietic differentiation.  lysine-specific demethylase 1 (lsd1) targets mono- or di-methylated histone h3k4 and h3k9 as well as non-histone substrates and functions in the regulation of gene expression as a transcriptional repressor or activator.  lysine-specific demethylase 1 (lsd1) has been reported to repress and activate transcription by mediating histone h3k4me1/2 and h3k9me1/2 demethylation, respectively.  lysine specific demethylase 1 (lsd1) catalyzes the demethylation of histone 3 to regulate gene expression.  lysine-specific demethylase 1 (lsd1) is an enzyme that removes methyl groups from mono- and dimethylated lys4 of histone h3, a post-translational modification associated with gene activation.  it is well-established that lysine-specific demethylase 1 (lsd1) is the first identified histone demethylase.  histone lysine specific demethylase 1 (lsd1) is the first histone demethylase to be discovered, which regulates various biological functions by making lysine of histone h3k4, h3k9 and non-histone substrates demethylated.  lysine-specific demethylase 1 (lsd1) is a flavin adenine dinucleotide (fad)-dependent enzyme that catalyzes the demethylation of histone h3 and regulates gene expression.  lysine-specific demethylase 1 (lsd1/aof2/kdm1a), the first enzyme with specific lysine demethylase activity to be described, demethylates histone and non-histone proteins and is essential for mouse embryogenesis.  lysine-specific demethylase 1 (lsd1/aof2/kdm1a), the first enzyme with specific lysine demethylase activity to be described, demethylates histone and non-histone proteins and is essential for mouse embryogenesis.  based on its demethylase enzymatic activity, lsd1 plays a pivotal role in vast range of cellular processes and cancers, but the understanding of its effects on inflammation is relatively limited. ||| ",yes
Is Lysyl oxidase crosslinking collagen?,"lysyl oxidase (ec 1.4.3.13) initiates the crosslinking of collagens and elastin by catalyzing oxidative deamination of the epsilon-amino group in certain lysine and hydroxylysine residues.  covalent intermolecular cross-linking of collagen is initiated by the action of lysyl oxidase (lox) on the telopeptidyl lysine and hydroxylysine residues.  lysyl oxidase initiates cross-linkage of collagen and elastin by catalysing the formation of a lysine-derived aldehyde.  the generation of covalent cross-linkages in collagen is initiated by the deamination by lysyl oxidase of specific lysine residues in this connective tissue protein.  background collagen cross-linking is covalent bonds among collagen fibers from catalysis of lysyl oxidase (lox) and advanced glycation end products (ages).  lysyl oxidase is an extracellular matrix, copper - dependent amine oxidase that catalyzes a key enzymatic step in the crosslinking of collagen and elastin.  lysyl oxidase (lo) is an extracellular copper-dependent enzyme that catalyzes the initial reaction in the formation of lysine or hydroxylysine-derived crosslinks during collagen biosynthesis.  lysyl oxidase catalyzes the final known enzymatic step required for collagen and elastin cross-linking.  lysyl oxidase-like 2 (loxl2) belongs to the family of lysyl oxidases, and as such promotes crosslinking of collagens and elastin by oxidative deamination of lysine residues.  intra- and intermolecular covalent cross-linking between collagen fibrils, catalyzed by lysyl oxidase (lox), determines the mechanical properties of connective tissues; however, mechanisms that regulate the collagen cross-linking according to tissue specificity are not well understood.  lysyl oxidase-like-2 (loxl2) is an enzyme secreted into the extracellular matrix that crosslinks collagens by mediating oxidative deamination of lysine residues.  lysyl oxidase (lox) initiates the crosslinking of the lysine-derived aldehyde and plays an essential role in maturation of collagen, for example in wound healing.  lysyl oxidase (lox) family oxidases, lox and loxl1-4, oxidize lysine residues in collagens and elastin, resulting in the covalent crosslinking and stabilization of these extracellular matrix (ecm) structural components, thus provide collagen and elastic fibers much of their tensile strength and structural integrity.  lysyl oxidase (lox) cross-links the side chain of collagen and elastin and thereby contributes to extracellular matrix (ecm) integrity.  lysyl oxidase (lo) plays a critical role in the formation and repair of the extracellular matrix (ecm) by oxidizing lysine residues in elastin and collagen, thereby initiating the formation of covalent crosslinkages which stabilize these fibrous proteins.  lysyl-oxidase-like 2 (loxl2) is a member of the lysyl oxidase family that catalyzes the cross-linking of collagens or elastins in the extracellular matrix, thus regulating the tensile strength of tissues.  lysyl oxidase (ec 1.4.3.13) oxidizes peptidyl lysine to peptidyl aldehyde residues within collagen and elastin, thus initiating formation of the covalent cross-linkages that insolubilize these extracellular proteins.  collagen cross-link and deposition depend on lysyl hydroxylation, which is catalyzed by procollagen-lysine, 2-oxoglutarate 5-dioxygenase (plod).  introduction: enzymatic cross-linking of the collagens within the extracellular matrix (ecm) catalyzed by enzymes such as lysyl oxidase (lox) and lysyl oxidase like-enzymes 1-4 (loxl), transglutaminase 2 (tg2), and peroxidasin (pxdn) contribute to fibrosis progression through extensive collagen cross-linking.  lysyl oxidase (lox) is a copper-dependent enzyme that initiates covalent crosslinking of elastin precursors by oxidizing peptidyl lysine to aminoadipic semi-aldehydes. ||| ",yes

Is Marfan syndrome associated with chordal rupture?,"marfan syndrome is an inherited systemic connective tissue disease which may lead to aortic root disease causing dilatation, dissection and rupture of the aorta.  marfan's syndrome (mfs), a heritable connective tissue disorder, may result in cardiac valvular insufficiency, aortic aneurysm or dissection, dislocated lens, and musculoskeletal abnormalities.  marfan syndrome is a inherited connective tissue disorder due to mutations in fibrillin-1.  the marfan syndrome is a heritable disorder of connective tissue associated with characteristic abnormalities of the skeletal, ocular and cardiovascular systems.  marfan syndrome (mfs) is a genetic disorder that affects connective tissue, impairing cardiovascular structures and function, such as heart valves and aorta.  marfan's syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder with risk of premature death from rupture of an aneurysm or aortic dissection.  marfan syndrome is a heritable disorder of the connective tissue that affects many systems of the body.  marfan syndrome (mfs) is an inherited connective tissue disease which frequently involves the cardiovascular system.  marfan syndrome is a hereditary disorder of the connective tissue that, in its most classic form, includes cardiovascular, ocular, and skeletal features.  marfan syndrome, a genetic disorder of the connective tissue, may cause aortic root dilation with aortic insufficiency, aortic dissection and mitral prolapse with mitral insufficiency.  a very rare case of marfan syndrome associated with acute aortic regurgitation due to rupture of a fibrous strand of a fenestrated aortic valve is presented.  marfan syndrome (mfs) is a multisystem connective tissue disorder that can lead to aortic dilation requiring aortic root replacement.  marfan syndrome is a heritable, systemic disorder of the connective tissue with a high penetrance, named after dr. antoine marfan.  we report two patients, aged 22 months and 5 years, each presenting an aortic root aneurysm related to marfan syndrome, and each treated with the bentall procedure without specific age-related mortality or morbidity.  the cardiovascular complication typically seen in marfan syndrome is aneurysmal dilatation of the aortic root, which begins in the first or second decade of life and leads to premature death caused by aortic rupture, dissection, or cardiac complications of aortic regurgitation.  this article presents an overview of the marfan syndrome including: history and epidemiology, clinical manifestations, diagnostic criteria, surgical intervention and follow-up.  a patient with marfan syndrome presented with enlargement of lumbosacral spinal canal with a bulky meningocele, and a fusiform aneurysm of the ascending aorta.  marfan syndrome might gradually become recognized as an inherited connective tissue disorder with potentially severe neurological complications during ageing.  however, the most serious complication in patients with marfan syndrome is progressive enlargement of the aortic root, which may lead to aortic dissection, rupture, or aortic regurgitation.  in infantile marfan syndrome, although involvement of the mitral valve is the most frequently encountered cardiovascular lesion, the aortic root can be more worrisome because of its excessive dilatation, leading to aortic insufficiency or dissection. ||| ",yes
Is Meis1 implicated in microphthalmia?,"we propose that meis1 is at the core of a genetic network implicated in eye patterning/microphthalmia, and represents an additional candidate for syndromic cases of these ocular malformations.  here we show that haploinsufficiency of meis1, which encodes a transcription factor with evolutionarily conserved expression in the embryonic trunk, brain and sensory organs, including the eye, causes microphthalmic traits and visual impairment in adult mice.  in the eye primordium, meis1 coordinates, in a dose-dependent manner, retinal proliferation and differentiation by regulating genes responsible for human microphthalmia and components of the notch signaling pathway.  microphthalmos, also called microphthalmia, is a rare developmental disorder of the eye that can be caused by genetic or chromosomal abnormalities or environmental factors.  thus, deregulated msx2 gene expression may be a plausible genetic mechanism by which the autosomal dominant form of congenital microphthalmia may arise.  the possible role of p.(arg62cys) and p.(gly220arg) in microphthalmia is similarly supported by the observed functional defects, with or without an additional impact from noncoding mab21l1 variants identified in each patient.  we present a likely causative novel variant in mab21l1, c.152g>t p.(arg51leu), in two family members with microphthalmia and aniridia, as well as novel or rare compound heterozygous variants of uncertain significance, c.184c>t p.(arg62cys)/c.-68t>c, and c.658g>c p.(gly220arg)/c.  microphthalmia with limb anomalies (mla, omim, 206920) is a rare autosomal-recessive disease caused by biallelic pathogenic variants in the smoc1 gene.  microphthalmia (mi) is a bhlhzip transcription factor that is essential for melanocyte development and postnatal function.  isolated microphthalmia is a model disease for studying early development of the human eye, and mutations in several key genes related to eye development have been linked to this phenotype.  the roles of microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (mitf) in the skeletal muscle and during myogenesis are unclear.  these data show that x-linked recessive syndromic microphthalmia exhibits genetic heterogeneity.  microphthalmos is a rare congenital anomaly characterized by reduced eye size and visual deficits of variable degree.  microphthalmia is a relatively common ocular malformation.  microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (mitf) is critically involved in melanin synthesis as well as differentiation of cells of the melanocytic lineage.  in our search for novel genes that cause autosomal recessive microphthalmia when mutated, we enrolled a family that consists of third-cousin parents and two children with isolated colobomatous microphthalmia.  the spectrum of clinical presentation includes nanophthalmia and posterior microphthalmia.  here we observed widespread meis2 expression in the developing palate in mice.  microphthalmia is a condition in which eyes are small in size, often associated with coloboma, as a result of aberrant eye development.  the microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (mitf) is a member of the myc family of basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper transcription factors. ||| ",yes

Is Migalastat used for treatment of Fabry Disease?,"migalastat is an orally-administered small molecule approved to treat the symptoms of fabry disease in patients with amenable mutations.  migalastat (1-deoxygalactonojirimycin) is approved for the treatment of fabry disease (fd) in patients with an amenable mutation.  given its convenient oral regimen and the limited therapeutic options available, migalastat is an important treatment option for fabry disease in patients with migalastat-amenable gla mutations.  we evaluated migalastat efficacy and biomarker changes in a prospective, single-center study on 14 patients with fabry disease (55 ± 14 years; 11 men).  approved therapies for fabry disease (fd) include migalastat, an oral pharmacological chaperone, and agalsidase beta and agalsidase alfa, 2 forms of enzyme replacement therapy.  migalastat (galafold™)-a small molecule drug developed by amicus therapeutics that restores the activity of specific mutant forms of α-galactosidase-has been approved for the treatment of fabry disease in the eu in patients with amenable mutations.  this article summarizes the milestones in the development of migalastat leading to this first approval in the eu for the long-term treatment of adults and adolescents aged ≥16 years with a confirmed diagnosis of fabry disease.  the treatment options for fabry disease (fd) are enzyme replacement therapy (ert) with agalsidase alfa or beta, and the oral pharmacological chaperone migalastat.  migalastat offers promise as a first-in-class oral monotherapy alternative treatment to intravenous ert for patients with fabry disease and amenable mutations.  migalastat can be used to treat japanese patients with fabry disease with gla mutations amenable to migalastat according to the dosage and administration approved in other countries.  oral migalastat has recently been approved for the treatment of anderson-fabry disease (fd) in patients aged ≥16 years with amenable mutations on the basis of two phase iii trials, facets and attract.  oral migalastat is the first pharmacological chaperone approved for treating patients  with fabry disease who have a migalastat-amenable gla mutation.  in this subgroup analysis of the global phase iii attract study, the efficacy and safety of oral migalastat, a pharmacologic chaperone, were investigated in japanese patients with fabry disease.  migalastat was associated with a clinically meaningful improvement in diarrhea in patients with fabry disease and amenable mutations.  to assess the utility of globotriaosylsphingosine (lyso-gb3) for clinical monitoring of treatment response in patients with fabry disease receiving migalastat.  migalastat hcl is an investigational, pharmacological chaperone for mutant α-galactosidase a, which is responsible for fabry disease, an x-linked, lysosomal storage disorder.  reductions in kidney globotriaosylceramide may be a useful surrogate endpoint to predict clinical benefit with migalastat in patients with fabry disease.  fabry disease (fd) is a progressive multisystemic disorder, treatable with recombinant enzyme replacement therapy (agalsidase).  these first real-world data show that migalastat substantially increases alpha-galactosidase-a activity, stabilizes related serum biomarkers, and improves cardiac integrity in male and female patients with amenable fabry disease mutations.  the main objective of the 18-month, randomised, active-controlled attract study was to assess the effects of migalastat on renal function in patients with fabry disease previously treated with ert. ||| ",yes
Is Musclin a secretory peptide?,"musclin has been described as a muscle-derived secretory peptide, responsive to insulin in vivo, and inducing insulin resistance in vitro.  in conclusion, we identified musclin, a novel skeletal muscle-derived secretory factor.  musclin is a novel skeletal muscle-derived secretory factor that was isolated by our group.  musclin contains a region homologous to natriuretic peptides (nps).  musclin possesses a region homologous to the natriuretic peptide family.  musclin is a novel skeletal muscle-derived secretory factor found in the signal sequence trap of mouse skeletal muscle cdnas.  here, we report the identification of a novel secretory factor, musclin, by signal sequence trap of mouse skeletal muscle cdnas.  musclin is a newly identified skeletal muscle-derived secretory factor, which has been recently characterized as a stimulator that induces insulin resistance in mice.  full-length musclin protein and kkkr-dependent cleaved form were secreted in media of musclin cdna-transfected mammalian cell cultures.  thus, musclin is found to bind with the natriuretic peptide clearance receptors.  musclin protein contained a region homologous to natriuretic peptide family, and kkkr, a putative serine protease cleavage site, similar to the natriuretic peptide family.  we conducted binding assays using various synthetic musclin peptides and mutant musclin proteins.  from an analysis of the actions of il-6 and of additional literature, we postulate that skeletal muscle also secretes an unidentified hormone, which we have named musculin (latin: musculus = muscle), which acts on the pancreatic beta-cell to restrain the size of the (beta-cell mass and to tonically inhibit insulin secretion and biosynthesis.  musclin mrna was detected at high level in fast gastrocnemius and plantaris muscles, but only as traces in soleus, a slow-twitch muscle.  musclin mrna was expressed almost exclusively in the skeletal muscle of mice.  therefore, mediation of the natriuretic peptide receptor in musclin-induced vasoconstriction can be considered.  this study investigated the interaction between musclin and np receptors (nprs).  however, the pathophysiological role of musclin in humans remains poorly understood.  plasma musclin levels were examined by radioimmunoassay.  we conclude that musclin is produced by myocytes in a highly fiber-type specific manner and that physiological changes in type iib mhc lead to coordinated musclin expression. ||| ",yes
Is Mycobacterium avium less susceptible to antibiotics than Mycobacterium tuberculosis?,"mycobacterium tuberculosis and mycobacterium avium are pathogenic slow-growing mycobacteria that cause distinct human diseases.  the genetic similarity between mycobacterium avium subsp.  mycobacterium avium (m. avium) and mycobacterium intracellulare (m. intracellulare) are the major causative agents of nontuberculous mycobacteria (ntm)-related pulmonary infections.  mycobacteria avium (m. avium) is a species of ubiquitous slowly growing nontuberculous mycobacteria.  nontuberculous mycobacteria, particularly mycobacterium avium, have been isolated from a significant percentage of patients with aids.  paratuberculosis and other mycobacterial species has confounded the development of m. avium subsp.  m. abscessus is intrinsically resistant to several classes of antibiotics, and an increasing number of strains isolated from patients exhibit resistance to most antibiotics considered for treatment of infections by this mycobacterium.  the non-tubercular mycobacterium, mycobacterium abscessus (m. abscessus), is a resistant, opportunistic pathogen that causes lung infections that are not curable, but which can be controlled with appropriate antibiotic regimens.  mycobacterium abscessus is a non-tuberculous mycobacterium that causes pulmonary and non-pulmonary infections.  of the non-tuberculous mycobacteria, mycobacterium abscessus is particularly refractory to antimicrobial therapy and new agents with activity against these pathogens are urgently needed.  mycobacterium abscessus is a non-tuberculous mycobacterium.  mycobacterium avium subspecies avium (m. avium) is frequently encountered in the environment, but also causes infections in animals and immunocompromised patients.  in contrast to recent advances in m. tuberculosis genetics and pathogenesis investigation, m. avium has remained genetically intractable and, consequently, its pathogenic strategies remain poorly understood.  contrary to most antimycobacterials, the whole-cell activity of ept was greater against m. abscessus than m. tuberculosis, but crystallographic and equilibrium binding data showed that ept binds leursmabs and leursmtb with similar residues and dissociation constants.  as such, m. abscessus is clinically resistant to the entire regimen of front-line m. tuberculosis drugs, and treatment with antibiotics that do inhibit m. abscessus in the lab results in cure rates of 50% or less.  nontuberculous mycobacterial infections caused by mycobacterium abscessus are responsible for a range of disease manifestations from pulmonary to skin infections and are notoriously difficult to treat, due to innate resistance to many antibiotics.  key points: mycobacterium abscessus subsp.  in contrast, mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (m. paratuberculosis) is a slow-growing organism that is the causative agent of johne's disease in cattle and chronic granulomatous infections in a variety of other ruminant hosts.  mycobacterium intracellulare is a slow-growing pathogenic mycobacterium closely related to mycobacterium avium.  mycobacterium abscessus is a rapid-growing, multidrug-resistant, non-tuberculous mycobacterial species responsible for a variety of human infections, such as cutaneous and pulmonary infections. ||| ",yes
Is NADPH oxidase 5 expressed in rodents?,"nadph oxidase produces ros, although the expression of its five subunits are thought to be restricted largely to non-neuronal cells.  the nad(p)h cytochrome b5 oxidoreductase, ncb5or (previously named b5+b5r), is widely expressed in human tissues and broadly distributed among the animal kingdom.  the expression and functional significance of nadph oxidase 5 (nox5) and its five isoforms in vascular cells is poorly understood.  here, we show that nadph oxidase subunits are present in neurons.  nadph oxidase 5 (nox5), the main isoform of nox in spermatozoa, has been recognized as the main active generators of reactive oxygen species (ros), including superoxide anion (o 2 -. )  nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (nadph) oxidase, which catalyzes the formation of reactive oxygen species (ros) in phagocytic cells, has five subunits: p67phox (""phox""refers to ""phagocyte oxidase""), p47phox, p40phox, p22phox, and gp91phox (catalytic subunit).  nadph oxidase 5 (nox5) is a homologue of the gp91(phox) subunit of the phagocyte nadph oxidase.  nad(p)h cytochrome b(5) oxidoreductase (ncb5or), comprising cytochrome b(5) and cytochrome b(5) reductase domains, is widely distributed in eukaryotic organisms.  nadph oxidases are enzymes that transport electrons across the plasma membrane and generate superoxide radical from molecular oxygen.  nadh cytochrome b(5) oxidoreductase (ncb5or) is found in animals and contains three domains similar to cytochrome b(5) (b(5)), chord-sgt1 (cs), and cytochrome b(5) reductase (b(5)r).  in a number of animal species soluble nadh-cytochrome b5 reductase of erythrocytes was compared with membrane-bound nadh-cytochrome b5 reductase of liver microsomes by using an antibody to purified nadh-cytochrome b5 reductase from rat liver microsomes.  peroxiredoxin 5 is the last discovered mammalian member of an ubiquitous family of peroxidases widely distributed among prokaryotes and eukaryotes.  in humans, there are 5 homologs of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (nadph) oxidases (noxes) that generate superoxide (o(2)(-)), which can dismute to produce ros, and play significant roles in innate immunity and cell proliferation.  nadph oxidases (noxes) are enzymes that preferentially use nadph as a substrate and generate superoxide.  overall, these results indicate that nadph oxidase is unexpectedly present in neurons and can contribute to neuronal apoptosis.  nox5 is expressed in lymphoid organs and testis and distinguished from the other nadph oxidases by its unique n terminus, which contains three canonical ef-hands, ca(2+)-binding domains.  previous studies have shown that the reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (nadph)- binding domain of rat liver microsomal steroid 5alpha-reductase isozyme-1 (r5alphar-1) is in a highly conserved region of the polypeptide sequence (residues 160-190).  nox5 is expressed in human blood vessels.  peroxiredoxin 5 is a mammalian thioredoxin peroxidase ubiquitously expressed in tissues.  to determine whether nox 5 is expressed in rabbit corneal stromal cells (rcsc). ||| ",no
Is NEMO a zinc finger protein?,"two variations of nemo's zinc finger are implicated in various disease states including ectodermal dysplasia and adult-onset glaucoma.  here, we report that the zinc finger (zf) motif, located in the regulatory c-terminal half of nemo, forms a specific complex with ubiquitin.  the regulatory domain is located in the c-terminal half of nemo and contains a classical cchc-type zinc finger (zf).  we recently demonstrated that the c-terminal zinc finger (zf) of nemo is also able to bind ubiquitin.  thus, our findings indicate that nemozfisa bona fide ubiquitin-binding domain of the ubiquitin-binding zinc finger type.  an important regulatory domain of nf-b essential modulator (nemo) is a ubiquitin-binding zinc finger, with a tetrahedral cys3his1 zinc-coordinating binding site.  the evolutionary conserved zinc finger protein znf503/zeppo2 (zinc finger elbow-related proline domain protein 2, zpo2) plays critical roles during embryogenesis.  recent study in several different systems has identified a set of novel zinc finger proteins that appear to form a distinct subfamily that we have named the net family.  neural zinc finger factor 1 (nzf-1) is a nonclassical zinc finger protein involved in neuronal development.  the net (noca, nlz, elb, tlp-1) subfamily of zinc finger proteins is an important mediator during developmental processes.  zinc finger swim-type containing 5 (zswim5) is a newly discovered protein, which contains a novel zinc-chelating domain swim (cxcxncxh), and is predicted to interact with dna or proteins.  altogether, these results shed light onto the role of nemo zf as a protein-binding motif and show that a precise structural integrity of the zf should be preserved to lead to a functional protein-recognition motif triggering full nf-kappab activation.  several classes of zinc finger proteins have been shown to bind other metal ions, including iron.  neural zinc finger factor 1 (nzf-1) is a member of a family of neural-specific transcription factors that contain multiple copies of a relatively uncharacterized zinc binding motif.  the zinc finger homeodomain enhancer-binding protein (zfhep) is involved in skeletal patterning, immune cell, muscle, and brain development, and is necessary for life.  previous studies have determined that the n-terminal region, a putative zinc finger, is capable of binding zn2+.  members of the net family (noc, nlz, elbow, and tlp-1) share two protein motifs--a buttonhead box and an sp motif--with zinc finger proteins from the sp family.  nemo (nf-kappab essential modulator) is a regulatory protein essential to the canonical nf-kappab signaling pathway, notably involved in immune and inflammatory responses, apoptosis, and oncogenesis.  c2h2 zinc finger proteins make up one of the largest protein families in eukaryotic organisms.  the negatively regulating zinc finger protein (nzfp) is an essential transcription repressor required for early development during gastrulation in xenopus laevis. ||| ",yes
Is NOD1 activated in inflammation?,"previous studies demonstrated that nod1 plays an important role in inflammatory cardiovascular diseases.  nod1 is a member of nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptors family that participates in many inflammatory processes.  the nucleotide-binding and oligomerization domain (nod)-containing protein 1 (nod1) plays the pivotal role in host-pathogen interface of innate immunity and triggers immune signalling pathways for the maturation and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines.  we found that nod2 through its n-terminal caspase recruitment domain directly binds and activates caspase-1 to trigger il-1beta processing and secretion in mdp-stimulated macrophages, whereas the c-terminal leucine-rich repeats of nod2 prevent caspase-1 activation in nonstimulated cells.  nod2, a nod-like receptor (nlr), is an intracellular sensor of bacterial muramyl dipeptide (mdp) that was suggested to promote secretion of the proinflammatory cytokine il-1beta.  gain-of-function in vitro experiments further showed that nod2 overexpression significantly promotes pro-inflammatory cytokine release in hasmc.  nod1, which is expressed by immune and non-immune cells, is activated after recognizing microbe-associated molecular patterns (mamps).  upon the recognition of ie-dap, nod1 self-oligomerizes in an atp-dependent fashion and interacts with adaptor molecule receptor-interacting protein 2 (rip2) for the propagation of innate immune signalling and initiation of pro-inflammatory immune responses.  therefore, our results indicate that nod2 is an asthma-related factor that can promote cell proliferation and inflammatory response by mediated expression of tslp in hasmc.  nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain protein 2 (nod2) stimulates diverse inflammatory responses resulting in differential cellular phenotypes.  thus, nod2 plays a key role in the b. anthracis-induced inflammatory response by being a critical mediator of il-1beta secretion.  nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain 1 (nod1), a pattern recognition receptor (prr) that detects bacterial peptidoglycan fragments and other danger signals, has been linked to inflammatory pathologies.  thus, our data suggest that nod2 is responsible for the membrane recruitment of rick to induce a regulated nf-kappab signaling and production of proinflammatory cytokines.  to identify the role of nod2 in vascular arterial obstructive diseases, we investigated the expression and pathophysiological role of nod2 in a vascular injury model of neointimal hyperplasia.  in response to pathogen attack, nod2 stimulates cytokine and defensin production by activating nuclear factor (nf)-kappab, a key transcription factor responsible for mediating downstream reactions.  nod2 is an intracellular protein involved in host recognition of specific bacterial molecules and is genetically associated with several inflammatory diseases, including crohn's disease (cd).  these results provide evidence for the involvement of nod2 in vascular homeostasis and tissue injury, serving as a potential molecular target in the modulation of arteriosclerotic vascular disease.  we conclude that nod2 is important for osteoclast differentiation and inflammatory bone resorption in vivo and also for the macrophage response to gram-negative bacteria.  by sensing the muramyl dipeptide (mdp), a bacterial wall component, nod2 triggers the nf-kappab signaling pathway and promotes the release of proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-8.  nod2 plays an important role in the innate immunity of the intestinal tract. ||| ",yes
Is NSD-1015 an inhibitor of Aromatic L-Amino Acid Decarboxylase?,"the centrally acting aromatic amino acid dopa decarboxylase (aadc) inhibitor, 3-hydroxybenzyl hydrazine (nsd-1015), is widely used to study the neurotransmitter-like actions of l-dopa.  were inhibited by nsd-1015 (25 mg kg(-1) i.p.  these results suggest that, while nsd-1015 blocks central aadc activity, it also acts as a monoamine oxidase inhibitor so maintaining striatal dopamine concentration by reducing dopamine metabolism.  following central aadc inhibition with nsd-1015 (25 mg kg(-1) i.p.  pretreatment of rats with the central aadc inhibitor, nsd-1015 (100 mg/kg i.p.  administration of nsd-1015 (50-200 mg/kg i.p.  nsd-1015 pretreatment inhibited dopamine formation and elevated l-dopa levels in plasma.  pretreatment with nsd-1015 (10 - 50 mg kg(-1); i.p.)  subjects administered single doses of ndi-010976 at 20, 50, or 200 mg had significant inhibition of dnl compared to placebo (mean inhibition relative to placebo was 70%, 85%, and 104%, respectively).  the o-arylcarbamate urb597 (cyclohexylcarbamic acid 3'-carbamoylbiphenyl-3-yl ester; also referred to as kds-4103) is a potent inhibitor of fatty-acid amide hydrolase (faah), an intracellular serine hydrolase responsible for the inactivation of the endogenous cannabinoid anandamide.  however, the effects of nsd-1015 on l-dopa-induced motor activity are unclear as both increases and decreases have been reported.  nsd-1015 (50-200 mg/kg i.p.)  nsd-1015, therefore, may not be an appropriate tool for the study of brain aadc activity and for assessing the neuromodulatory role of l-dopa.  ndi-010976, an allosteric inhibitor of acetyl-coenzyme a carboxylases (acc) acc1 and acc2, reduces hepatic de novo lipogenesis (dnl) and favorably affects steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis in animal models of fatty liver disease.  we now investigate the effects of the centrally acting aromatic amino acid dopa decarboxylase (aadc) inhibitor nsd-1015 (3-hydroxybenzyl hydrazine) on the motor actions of l-dopa and dopamine agonist drugs in mptp treated common marmosets.  acc inhibition with a single dose of ndi-010976 is well tolerated and results in a profound dose-dependent inhibition of hepatic dnl in overweight adult male subjects.  some derivatives exhibited potent inhibitory activity against human 11β-hsd1, although with low selectivity over the isoenzyme 11β-hsd2, and poor microsomal stability.  ly290181 is a potent inhibitor of cell proliferation, producing 50% inhibition of vascular smooth muscle, endothelial, chinese hamster ovary, hela, and human erythroleukemia cells at concentrations of 8-40 nm.  lysine decarboxylase (ldc) catalyzes the first-step in the biosynthetic pathway of quinolizidine alkaloids (qas), which form a distinct, large family of plant alkaloids.  ay-994 (trans-1,4-bis-(2-chlorobenzyl-aminomethyl) cyclohexane dihydrochloride), a potent inhibitor of the enzymatic reduction of the delta 7-double bond of delta 5,7-sterols, has been shown to inhibit, at higher concentrations (10-4 m), the enzymatic reduction of the delta 14-double bond of cholesta-8,14-dien-3 beta-ol and cholesta-7,14-dien-3 beta-ol. ||| ",yes
Is Obeticholic Acid used for treatment of Primary Biliary Cholangitis?,"this review will summarize the use of obeticholic acid (oca) in treatment of primary biliary cholangitis (pbc).  obeticholic acid (oca) is the second-line treatment approved for patients with primary biliary cholangitis (pbc) and an inadequate response or intolerance to ursodeoxycholic acid.  obeticholic acid (oca) is approved for the treatment of patients with primary biliary cholangitis (pbc) who are partial responders or intolerant to ursodeoxycholic acid.  we tested whether the treatment with obeticholic acid (oca) would improve liver excretion of bile acids compared with placebo in 8 patients with primary biliary cholangitis.  obeticholic acid (oca) is a potent farnesoid x receptor (fxr) agonist approved for the treatment of primary biliary cholangitis.  obeticholic acid (oca) was recently approved as the only on-label alternative for patients with primary biliary cholangitis (pbc) with intolerance or suboptimal response to ursodeoxycholic acid (udca).  obeticholic acid (oca) and fibrates are second-line therapies for patients with primary biliary cholangitis (pbc) with an inadequate response to ursodeoxycholic acid (udca).  obeticholic acid (oca) is exemplified as a potent drug for treating primary biliary cirrhosis and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease by inhibiting bile acid synthesis.  obeticholic acid (oca) is a semisynthetic farnesoid x receptor (fxr) agonist, an analogue of chenodeoxycholic acid (cdca) which is indicated for the treatment of primary biliary cholangitis (pbc) in combination with ursodeoxycholic acid (udca).  this article provides expert guidance on the management of pruritus symptoms in patients receiving obeticholic acid (oca) as treatment for primary biliary cholangitis (pbc).  obeticholic acid (oca) is a semisynthetic bile acid (ba) analog and potent farnesoid x receptor agonist approved to treat cholestasis.  recently obeticholic acid, a farnesoid x receptor (fxr) agonist, was fda-approved to treat cholestatic liver diseases, providing a new therapeutic strategy for cholestasis.  the general usage of ursodeoxycholic acid for primary biliary cirrhosis needs reevaluation.  recently obeticholic acid (oca) which is a farnesoid x receptor (fxr) agonist was approved by fda to treat cholestatic liver diseases, which provided us a newly therapeutic strategy against cholestasis.  obeticholic acid (oca) is an agonist of the nuclear bile acid receptor farnesoid x receptor, which regulates hepatic bile acid metabolism.  among bile acids, ursodeoxycholic acid (udca) is the drug of choice for treating primary biliary cirrhosis and dissolving cholesterol gallstones.  obeticholic acid (oca) was shown to be effective in more than one-third of patients not responding to ursodeoxycholic acid in a real-world context in italy.  ursodeoxycholic acid has a marginal therapeutic effect for primary biliary cirrhosis.  some randomised clinical trials have found an effect of ursodeoxycholic acid for primary biliary cirrhosis.  we tested whether oca treatment would influence hepatic transport of conjugated bile acids in patients with primary biliary cholangitis (pbc) who responded inadequately to treatment with ursodeoxycholic acid (udca). ||| ",yes
Is PER3 required for CHK2 activation in human cells?,"in vitro and in vivo kinase assays showed that pctk3 was phosphorylated by pka at ser(12), ser(66), and ser(109) and that pctk3 activity significantly increased via phosphorylation at ser(12) by pka even in the absence of cyclin a2.  the results of the present study identify a novel regulatory mechanism of erk3 that operates in a cell-cycle-dependent manner.  here we describe the mechanisms of catalytic activation of pctk3 by cyclin a2 and camp-dependent protein kinase (pka).  taken together, our results provide the first evidence for the mechanisms of catalytic activation of pctk3 by cyclin a2 and pka and a physiological function of pctk3.  phosphoinositide 3-kinase (pi3k) participates in extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (erk1-2) activation according to signal strength, through unknown mechanisms.  our results suggest that nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of erk3 is required for its negative regulatory effect on cell cycle progression.  in the presence of cyclin a2, pctk3 activity was comparable to cdk2 activity.  using pc12 cells as a model system of neuronal cells, we show that chk participates in signaling mediated by trka receptors.  chk2 degradation is independent of both its activation and its kinase activity, but also of the phosphorylation in s456.  erk3 (extracellular-signal-regulated kinase 3) is an atypical mapk (mitogen-activated protein kinase) that is suggested to play a role in cell-cycle progression and cellular differentiation.  the aim of our study was to explore whether cr2 can independently mediate the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (mapks, including erk, jnk, and p38mapk), and to highlight the molecular mechanism of cd4+ cell deletion in aids.  chk was found to be associated with tyrosine-phosphorylated trka receptors in pc12 cells upon stimulation with ngf.  we find that chpks can target key regulators of transcription and replication.  thus, chk is a novel signaling molecule that participates in trka signaling, associates directly with trka receptors upon ngf stimulation, and is involved in neurite outgrowth of pc12 cells in response to ngf.  our data identify the first physiological protein substrate for erk3 and suggest a functional link between these kinases in which mk5 is a downstream target of erk3, while mk5 acts as a chaperone for erk3.  pkk may be phosphorylated by two specific mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinases, mekk2 and mekk3, and this interaction may in part be mediated through a critical activation loop residue, thr184.  an in vitro kinase assay using retinoblastoma protein as the substrate showed that pctk3 was specifically activated by cyclin a2 but not by cyclin e1, although its activity was lower than that of cdk2.  amino acid sequence analysis revealed that pctk3 contained four putative pka phosphorylation sites.  the present work aimed at investigating erk3 distribution during cell cycle and apoptosis in human tumor hela cells.  activation and blocking tests of mapks (erk, jnk, and p38mapk) were carried out in hos-cr2, hos-cd4, and hos-cd4cr2 cells. ||| ",yes
Is PLK2 involved in alpha-synuclein phosphorylation in Parkinson disease?,"polo like kinase 2 (plk2), a serine/threonine serum inducible kinase, has been proposed to be the major factor responsible for phosphorylating alpha-synuclein (α-syn) at serine-129 (ser-129) in parkinson's disease (pd).  polo-like kinase 2 (plk2) has been recently recognized as the major enzyme responsible for phosphorylation of α-synuclein at s129 in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that this kinase may play a key role in the pathogenesis of parkinson's disease and other synucleinopathies.  these results support a significant role for a plk kinase in phosphorylating α-synuclein at ser129 in the brain, and suggest that plk2 is responsible for this activity under physiological conditions.  alpha-synuclein (α-syn) is a neuronal protein that is highly implicated in parkinson's disease (pd), and protein phosphatase 2a (pp2a) is an important serine/threonine phosphatase that is associated with neurodegenerative diseases, such as pd.  α-synuclein plays important roles in the development of parkinson's disease (pd) pathologies.  polo-like kinase 2 (plk2) was previously proposed as an important kinase in α-synuclein phosphorylation at ser129.  to better understand the role of plk2 in α-synuclein phosphorylation in vivo, we further evaluated the effect of plk2 genetic knockdown and pharmacological inhibition on phospho-α-syn levels in different brain regions of plk2 knockout (ko), heterozygous (het) and wild-type (wt) mice.  α-synuclein (α-syn), especially its abnormal oligomeric and phosphorylated form, plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of parkinson's disease (pd).  although α-synuclein (α-syn) phosphorylation has been considered as a hallmark of sporadic and familial parkinson disease (pd), little is known about the effect of pd-linked mutations on α-syn phosphorylation.  α-synuclein phosphorylated at ser 129 (phospho-α-syn) is the most common synuclein modification observed in parkinson's disease pathology and transgenic animal models.  alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn) phosphorylation at serine 129 is characteristic of parkinson disease (pd) and related alpha-synulceinopathies.  elevated phosphorylation of the pd-defining pathological protein, α-synuclein, correlates with its aggregation and toxic accumulation in neurons, whilst genetic missense mutations in the kinases pten-induced putative kinase 1 and leucine-rich repeat kinase 2, increase susceptibility to pd.  it is known that α-synuclein is phosphorylated (p-α-synuclein) in pd and tau-hyperphosphorylation (p-tau) is also a pathologic feature of pd.  the pathologic accumulation and aggregation of α-synuclein (α-syn) underlies parkinson's disease (pd).  to gain insight into the functions of alpha-synuclein, we sought protein kinases that phosphorylate alpha-synuclein in the central nervous system.  alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn) is implicated in the pathogenesis of parkinson's disease, genetically through missense mutations linked to early onset disease and pathologically through its presence in lewy bodies.  alpha-synuclein, a major constituent of lewy bodies (lbs), has been implicated to play a critical role in the pathogenesis of parkinson's disease (pd), although the physiological function of alpha-synuclein has not yet been known.  here, we show that expression of g2019s-lrrk2 increases α-synuclein mobility and enhances aggregation of α-synuclein in primary cultured neurons and in dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta, a susceptible brain region in pd.  increasing evidence suggests that phosphorylation may play an important role in the oligomerization, fibrillogenesis, lewy body (lb) formation, and neurotoxicity of alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn) in parkinson disease.  recent studies demonstrated cutaneous phosphorylated α synuclein (p-syn) deposition in idiopathic and some monogenetic parkinson disease (pd) patients, suggesting synucleinopathy identical to that in the brain. ||| ",yes
Is PLK2 involved in alpha-synuclein phosphorylation in the nervous system?,"polo like kinase 2 (plk2), a serine/threonine serum inducible kinase, has been proposed to be the major factor responsible for phosphorylating alpha-synuclein (α-syn) at serine-129 (ser-129) in parkinson's disease (pd).  to gain insight into the functions of alpha-synuclein, we sought protein kinases that phosphorylate alpha-synuclein in the central nervous system.  alpha-synuclein (α-syn) is a neuronal protein that is highly implicated in parkinson's disease (pd), and protein phosphatase 2a (pp2a) is an important serine/threonine phosphatase that is associated with neurodegenerative diseases, such as pd.  together the data reveal a functional interaction between alpha-synuclein and pp2a that leads to pp2a activation and underscores a key role for alpha-synuclein in protein phosphorylation.  we further examined the relationship between mapk signaling and the effects of alpha-synuclein expression on ecdysone-inducible neuro2a cell lines and found that cells expressing alpha-synuclein had less phosphorylated mapks.  alpha-synuclein is a small protein implicated in the pathophysiology of parkinson's disease (pd).  alpha synuclein can be phosphorylated at serine129 (p-s129), and the presence of highly phosphorylated alpha-synuclein in lewy bodies suggests changes to its phosphorylation status has an important pathological role.  several lines of evidence suggest that phosphorylation of α-synuclein (α-syn) at s87 or s129 may play an important role in regulating its aggregation, fibrillogenesis, lewy body formation, and neurotoxicity in vivo.  in conclusion, prap functions as a downstream target for pyk2/raftk and plays a role in alpha-synuclein phosphorylation.  together, our findings provide novel mechanistic insight into the role of phosphorylation at s87 and s129 in the pathogenesis of synucleinopathies and potential roles of phosphorylation in alpha-syn normal biology.  since fyn regulates various signal transduction pathways in the central nervous system and plays an essential role in the neuronal cell differentiation, survival, and plasticity, results of this paper indicate that phosphorylation of alpha-synuclein might be involved in one of the fyn-mediated signaling pathways in neuronal cells.  we demonstrate that the kinase(s) responsible for alpha-synuclein s129 phosphorylation is constitutively active in sh-sy5y cells and involves casein kinase 2 activity.  inhibition of pp2a dramatically increased ser40 phosphorylation only in alpha-synuclein overexpressors in which alpha-synuclein was also found to co-immunoprecipitate with pp2a.  alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn) phosphorylation at serine 129 is characteristic of parkinson disease (pd) and related alpha-synulceinopathies.  alpha-synuclein (α-syn) is the principal protein component of lewy bodies, a pathological hallmark of parkinson's disease (pd).  increasing evidence suggests that phosphorylation may play an important role in the oligomerization, fibrillogenesis, lewy body (lb) formation, and neurotoxicity of alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn) in parkinson disease.  α-synuclein (α-syn) is a cytosolic protein known for its association with neurodegenerative diseases, including parkinson's disease and other synucleinopathies.  alpha-synuclein is a presynaptic protein involved in the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative diseases, such as parkinson's disease.  we observed that alpha-synuclein overexpression caused reduced ser40 phosphorylation in mn9d cells and inducible pc12 cells.  such phosphorylation was inhibited by prap expression, suggesting that prap negatively regulates alpha-synuclein phosphorylation following cell stress. ||| ",yes
Is POLD3 essential for mouse development?,"experimentation with pbx1 knockout mice has shown that pbx1 is necessary for early embryogenesis.  dlx3, a homeodomain transcription factor, is essential for placental development in the mouse.  here, we investigated how its absence alters the trajectory of postnatal brain development using as model the pallid mouse.  pax transactivation domain-interacting protein (ptip, or paxip1) is required for mouse development and has been implicated in dna damage responses and histone modification.  the dlx3(-/-) mouse embryo dies at embryonic d 9.5-10 putatively due to placental failure.  the paired-box homeodomain transcription factor pax3 is a key regulator of the nervous system, neural crest and skeletal muscle development.  because patch mouse mutants which fail to express pdgf alpha-receptor also have rib abnormalities, we sought to determine whether pax3 may influence the expression of this receptor.  dlx3-null mice die by embryonic day 10.0 due to placental failure.  the homeodomain protein distal-less 3 (dlx3) is essential for normal placental development in mice.  taken together, these data suggest that pax6 is not essential for pituitary differentiation, but rather functions to establish appropriate neonatal homeostatic levels of gh and prl, possibly through regulation of translational or secretory mechanisms.  the expression pattern of lhx3 is well conserved between xenopus and mouse, underscoring the functional importance of this gene as a regulator of development.  we concluded that the loss of loxl3 attenuates mouse embryonic lung development.  we have used the splotch mouse which has a mutation in the pax3 gene to determine what role pax3 may play in rib morphogenesis.  dlx3 is specifically required for full expression and secretion of pgf in vivo.  p-lim (lhx3a) is a lim homeodomain transcription factor essential for pituitary development and motor neuron specification in mice.  mdm2-conditional col3.6-cre mice die at birth and display multiple skeletal defects.  moreover, in vitro studies support the conclusion that dlx3 is sufficient to directly modulate expression of the pgf gene promoter in placental cells.  lysyl oxidase-like 3 (loxl3), a human disease gene candidate, is a member of the lysyl oxidase (lox) family and is indispensable for mouse palatogenesis and vertebral column development.  in this study, we investigated a possible role for loxl3 in mouse embryonic lung development.  lhx3/lim-3/p-lim is a lim homeodomain transcription factor which is essential in mice for the development of anterior and intermediate lobes of the pituitary gland. ||| ",yes
Is PTEN involved in follicular thyroid carcinoma?,"therefore, thyroid tumor cell lines show alteration of pten gene expression regulation.  papillary thyroid carcinoma (ptc) arises from the thyroid follicular epithelium and represents the most frequent thyroid malignancy.  several data indicate that silencing of pten gene expression may be relevant in follicular thyroid cell transformation.  this study has demonstrated that the under-expression of pten protein and the over-expression of her-2 protein may play a role in the carcinogenesis and development of thyroid cancer.  therefore, this study investigated the pten expression of thyroid cancer and the relationship between pten, clinical status and other biologic factors such as her-2/neu and p53.  most thyroid cancers are derived from the follicular cell.  pten protein was found to be under-expressed more frequently in thyroid cancers (29%) than in benign thyroid tumors (4.2%).  thus, in the present study regulation of pten gene expression in thyroid cells was investigated.  thyroid carcinomas derived from follicular cells comprise papillary thyroid carcinoma (ptc), follicular thyroid carcinoma, poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma (pdtc) and undifferentiated anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (atc).  these results demonstrate that the prevalence of the ptc gene in thyroid tumor is low and may not be essential for human thyroid tumorigenesis.  the reduction in pten expression in thyroid cancers was not significantly related with the recorded clinical factors such as size, age, lymph node metastasis and p53, except for her-2 which was found to be significantly related (p=0.001).  papillary thyroid carcinoma (ptc) cells express oncofetal fibronectin (onffn) mrna, which may be useful to detect circulating tumor cells.  follicular carcinoma (ftc) is considered more malignant than papillary thyroid carcinoma (ptc), and anaplastic thyroid cancer (atc) is one of the most lethal human cancers.  thyroid cancer is the most common malignancy of endocrine system, and papillary thyroid cancer (ptc) is the most common subtype.  follicular variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma (fvptc) is a common variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma (ptc), but the association between braf mutation and the clinicopathological and ultrasonographical characteristics of fvptc has not been well studied.  this gene has been thought to act as a tumorigenetic factor in thyroid carcinoma, although the action of ptc oncogene products is still unknown.  higher thyrotropin concentrations are predictive for a malignant nature of follicular neoplasm.  foxe1, a thyroid-specific transcription factor also known as ttf-2, was recently identified as a major genetic risk factor for papillary thyroid carcinoma (ptc).  papillary thyroid cancer (ptc) is the most common well-differentiated thyroid cancer.  the follicular variant (fv) of papillary thyroid carcinoma is characterized by a follicular growth pattern and cytologic features of papillary carcinoma. ||| ",yes
Is PUVA therapy indicated for eczema treatment?,"systemic puva therapy may be useful in the treatment of chronic palmoplantar eczema.  both oral and bath puva with 8-methoxypsoralen (8-mop) have been shown to be effective in the treatment of chronic palmoplantar eczema.  this study compared the effects of localized high-dose uva1 irradiation versus topical cream puva for treatment of chronic vesicular dyshidrotic eczema.  topical psoralen plus uva (puva) is an effective treatment for localized forms of eczema, psoriasis, and palmoplantar pustulosis, which avoids some of the undesirable side-effects of systemic psoralens.  local bath-puva therapy is of value in the management of chronic palmoplantar eczema resistant to standard modes of topical treatment.  our purpose was to assess the effectiveness of local bath-puva therapy in 28 patients with chronic palmar or plantar eczema or both who were resistant to conventional topical treatment.  to compare the therapeutic efficacy, tolerability and duration of remission after oral vs. bath puva using 8-mop in patients with chronic palmoplantar eczema.  oral puva is preferable for patients with hyperkeratotic eczema and bath puva for patients with dyshidrotic eczema.  local puva (psoralen plus uva light) is an effective outpatient treatment for patients with palmoplantar eczema or psoriasis.  previous studies have shown that oral puva is effective in urticaria pigmentosa.  psoralen plus uv-a (puva) is an effective therapy for psoriasis but also for other inflammatory dermatoses.  oral puva is very effective for the long-term treatment of urticaria pigmentosa as well as systemic mastocytosis.  recent studies have demonstrated that systemic or topical puva therapy, i.e., ultraviolet a (uva) irradiation following treatment with 8-methoxypsoralen (8-mop), is effective against the sclerotic skin lesions in systemic sclerosis.  topical puva-paint avoids some of the unwanted side effects of systemic psoralens and has been used successfully in the treatment of palmoplantar eczema and psoriasis.  hyperkeratotic eczema cleared significantly better with oral than with bath puva (p=0.03).  puva, the combination of psoralen (p) and long-wave ultraviolet radiation (uva), is being used increasingly in the management of psoriasis and several other dermatologic disorders.  8-methoxypsoralen+uva (ultraviolet light of 320-400 nm) known as puva has been in use for a number of years for the treatment of psoriasis and vitiligo.  we studied the long-term effectiveness of oral puva treatment in urticaria pigmentosa as well as in systemic mastocytosis.  since 1975 oral 8-methoxypsoralen administered in association with ultraviolet-a radiation (uva), (puva) has been widely used to treat psoriasis and other cutaneous diseases.  however, few data are available on the effectiveness of local bath-puva therapy in palmoplantar eczema. ||| ",yes
Is Pfh1 a component of the replisome?,"pfh1, the sole member of the pif1 helicases in schizosaccharomyces pombe, is multifunctional and essential for maintenance of both the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes.  pfh1, the sole schizosaccharomyces pombe pif1 family dna helicase, is essential for maintenance of both nuclear and mitochondrial dnas.  these findings argue that pfh1 is a positive regulator of telomere length and telomere replication.  we show that the 76 c-terminal residues are responsible for targeting pfhp1 to the nucleus.  our results uncover a novel function of pif1 and provide insights into the mechanism of hr.  these results suggest p1 repa is structurally homologous to plasmid initiators, including those of f, r6k, psc101, pcu1, pps10, pfa3, pgsh500, rts1, rephi1b, repfib, and rsf1010.  it is unclear how rev1 is recruited to replication foci in cells.  pfh1 promoted semi-conservative replication through telomeric dna, as replication forks moved more slowly through telomeres when pfh1 levels were reduced.  the effects of pfh1 on telomere replication and telomere length are likely direct as pfh1 exhibited high telomere binding in cells expressing endogenous levels of pfh1.  however, we lack mechanistic insights into the functions of pfh1 and its different motifs.  in contrast, here we show that, instead of depending on rep, pf replication depends on uvrd, an accessory helicase implicated in dna repair.  in addition, npfh1 displaced proteins from dna and possessed strand-annealing activity.  recombinant pf1-cys-prx protein (rpf1-cys-prx) competed with glutathione (gsh) for fp and inhibited fp degradation by gsh.  we have assessed the properties of an open reading frame pfprex (formerly known as pom1) and confirm that it specifies a multi-domain polypeptide with dna primase, dna helicase, dna polymerase and 3'-5' exonuclease activities.  pif1 has a role in dna synthesis across hard-to-replicate sites and in lagging-strand synthesis with polymerase δ (polδ).  pf replicates by a rolling circle replication system which depends on a phage-encoded initiator protein and host factors usually involved in chromosome replication.  here we show that the nuclear isoform of pfh1 (npfh1) unwound rna/dna hybrids more efficiently than dna/dna, suggesting that pfh1 resolves rna/dna structures like r-loops in vivo.  rep, an accessory replicative dna helicase, is crucial for replication of filamentous phages in escherichia coli.  pfhp1 is essential for parasite proliferation and the heritable silencing of genes linked to antigenic variation, host cell invasion, and sexual conversion.  furthermore, we reveal that each of the three functional domains of pfhp1 are required for heterochromatin formation, gene silencing, and mitotic parasite proliferation. ||| ",no
Is Prochlorococcus the most abundant photosynthetic organism?,"prochlorococcus is the most abundant photosynthetic prokaryote on our planet.  prochlorococcus was isolated around 20 years ago and is probably the most abundant photosynthetic organism on earth.  prochlorococcus and synechococcus are the most abundant photosynthetic organisms in oligotrophic waters and responsible for a significant percentage of the earth's primary production.  prochlorococcus is the numerically dominant phototroph in the tropical and subtropical oceans, accounting for half of the photosynthetic biomass in some areas.  prochlorococcus is a major contributor to primary production, and globally the most abundant photosynthetic genus of picocyanobacteria because it can adapt to highly stratified low-nutrient conditions that are characteristic of the surface ocean.  prochlorococcus describes a diverse and abundant genus of marine photosynthetic microbes.  prochlorococcus is the numerically dominant phototroph in the oligotrophic subtropical ocean and carries out a significant fraction of marine primary productivity.  prochlorococcus is an abundant marine cyanobacterium responsible for a significant part of global primary production.  photosynthetic prokaryotes of the genus prochlorococcus play a major role in global primary production in the world's oligotrophic oceans.  prochlorococcus, the most abundant genus of photosynthetic organisms, owes its remarkably large depth distribution in the oceans to the occurrence of distinct genotypes adapted to either low- or high-light niches.  prochlorococcus is a major photosynthetic prokaryote in nutrient-limited, open ocean environments and an important participant in the global carbon cycle.  the phytoplankton community in the oligotrophic open ocean is numerically dominated by the cyanobacterium prochlorococcus, accounting for approximately half of all photosynthesis.  prochlorococcus, a unique marine picocyanobacterium, contains the divinyl- (dv-) type chlorophylls (chls), dv-chl a and dv-chl b, as its photosynthetic pigments.  marine picocyanobacteria of the genera prochlorococcus and synechococcus numerically dominate the picophytoplankton of the world ocean, making a key contribution to global primary production.  the ability of prochlorococcus to numerically dominate open ocean regions and contribute significantly to global carbon cycles is dependent in large part on its effectiveness in transforming light energy into compounds used in cell growth, maintenance, and division.  recently, genes encoding the phycobiliprotein phycoerythrin were identified in several prochlorococcus isolates, thus making it the only extant photosynthetic prokaryote to possess a chlorophyll a/b antenna as well as phycobiliprotein genes.  newly designed primers targeting rbcl (co2 fixation), psba (photosystem ii) and rnpb (reference) genes were used in qrt-pcr assays to assess the photosynthetic capability of natural communities of prochlorococcus, the most abundant photosynthetic organism on earth and a major contributor to primary production in oligotrophic oceans.  here we show that the moderate low-light-adapted strain prochlorococcus sp.  picocyanobacteria such as synechococcus and prochlorococcus depend on chlorophyll a-binding protein complexes to capture light energy.  recent measurements of natural populations of the marine cyanobacterium prochlorococcus indicate this numerically dominant phototroph assimilates phosphorus (p) at significant rates in p-limited oceanic regions. ||| ",yes
Is Propofol used for short-term sedation?,"propofol is a commonly used sedative medication for procedural sedation with a limited side effect profile.  propofol is an anesthetic agent that is commonly used for conscious sedation.  propofol is also being increasingly used for sedation.  propofol is commonly used for sedation during endoscopic procedures.  propofol is a short-acting, intravenous sedative-hypnotic agent that is widely used for the induction and maintenance of general anesthesia and sedation.  propofol is a short-acting, hypnotic agent that is increasingly being used for gastrointestinal endoscopic sedation.  propofol (2.6-diisopropylphenol), a short-acting hypnotic agent, has been increasingly used to provide deep sedation in the endoscopy community with an acceptable safety profile.  the administration of propofol by the endoscopist and the assistant nurse, is an effective and safe method of sedation in patients of low and high-risk as well as in elderly patients.  propofol (2,6-diisopropylphenol) is an ultrashort-acting sedative agent with sedative and amnestic effects that is used not only for anesthesia but also for sedation during minor outpatient procedures and endoscopic examinations.  propofol (2,6-diisopropylphenol) is an intravenous short-acting anaesthetic widely used for inducing and maintaining anaesthesia.  this finding suggests that propofol should remain the drug of choice for short duration anaesthesia.  propofol is increasingly being used for sedation in colonoscopy; however, its benefits over midazolam (± short-acting opioids) are not well quantified.  propofol (2,6-diisopropyl phenol) is a relatively new intravenous sedative hypnotic with an ideal pharmacokinetic profile for conscious sedation.  propofol is often used as an anesthetic agent for electroconvulsive therapy (ect).  propofol-based sedation administered by anesthesiologists and the routine use of end-tidal capnography and bispectral index (bis) monitoring may attenuate risks of complications.  propofol (2,6-diisopropylphenol) is a versatile, short-acting, intravenous (i.v.)  propofol (2,6 di-isopropylphenol) is considered to be a short acting anaesthetic that is both rapid in onset and short in duration after cessation, but data on pharmacokinetics and metabolism in neonates were absent.  the recovery from sedation was faster in patients receiving propofol, although this did not reach statistical significance.  propofol has advantages as a sedative agent for endoscopic procedures including rapid onset, short half-life and rapid recovery time.  propofol is a widely used, short-acting, and intravenously administered hypnotic agent with notable antioxidant and free radical scavenging activities. ||| ",yes
Is RANKL secreted from the cells?,"previously, rankl was found to be localized to secretory lysosomes in osteoblastic cells and to translocate to the cell surface in response to stimulation with rank-fc-conjugated beads.  the distribution of rankl-expressing cells was immunohistochemically observed.  we also showed that rankl is relocated to the plasma membrane in response to stimulation with rank-fc-coated beads, indicating that the lysosomal organelles where rankl is localized function as secretory lysosomes.  furthermore, knockdown of vps33a expression reduced the lysosomal storage of rankl and caused the accumulation of newly synthesized rankl in the golgi apparatus, indicating that vps33a is involved in transporting rankl from the golgi apparatus to secretory lysosomes.  rankl and rank were colocalised in mast cells of nasal mucosa tissue.  rankl is mainly expressed by synovial fibroblasts and t cells within the joints of rheumatoid arthritis patients.  expression of rankl protein and mrna was analyzed by flow cytometry, elisa, and real-time pcr.  here, we investigate under which conditions human basophils express rankl.  rankl was first discovered as a t cell-derived activator of dendritic cells (dcs) and has many functions in the immune system, including organogenesis, cellular development.  in this study, we showed that rankl is predominantly localized in lysosomal organelles, but little is found on the cell surface of osteoblastic cells.  the expression of rankl increased in endothelial cells, inflammatory cells and periodontal ligament cells.  rankl, a member of tumor necrosis factor (tnf) superfamily, regulates the differentiation, activation, and survival of osteoclasts through binding to its cognate receptor, rank.  rankl was specifically deleted in t cells (tnfsf11(flox/δ) lck-cre), in collagen vi expressing cells including synovial fibroblasts (tnfsf11(flox/δ) col6a1-cre) and in collagen ii expressing cells including articular chondrocytes (tnfsf11(flox/δ) col2a1-cre).  rankl plays a pivotal role in the differentiation, function and survival of osteoclasts, the principal bone-resorbing cells.  although rankl is expressed in most immune cells and tissues, it is not clear how this might affect allergic inflammation.  rankl is involved in multifaceted processes of immunoregulation and bone resorption such as they occur in rheumatoid arthritis (ra).  the expression of rankl on synovial fibroblasts rather than t cells is predominantly responsible for the formation of osteoclasts and erosions during inflammatory arthritis.  however, subcellular trafficking of rankl and its regulatory mechanisms in osteoblastic cells is still unclear.  these results suggest that rankl storage in secretory lysosomes is important to control osteoclast activation and to maintain bone homeostasis.  to date, studies on physiological role of rankl have been mainly carried out with extracellular rankl probably due to difficulties in achieving high level expression of functional transmembrane rankl (mrankl). ||| ",yes
Is RASA2 involved in melanoma?,"alterations in the ras signaling cascade are almost uniformly present in melanoma.  the majority of human melanomas harbor activating mutations in either the braf or nras gene.  the molecular changes responsible for the biological activity of ra in melanoma are not well understood.  consequently, we investigated the mutational profile of b-raf and n-ras in biopsies and corresponding cell lines from metastatic tumor lesions of 109 melanoma patients (ajcc stage iii/iv), and its respective impact on survival.  in melanoma, the ras/raf/mek/erk signalling pathway is an area of great interest, because it regulates tumor cell proliferation and survival.  to gain further insight into ras isoforms at transcriptional level, we obtained the cutaneous melanoma data from cbioportal and investigated the ras mrna expression levels in different stages of melanoma and evaluated their correlation with clinical characteristics and patients' survival.  in general, melanomas carry a mutated nras, a mutated braf, or concurrent braf and pten mutations.  moreover, high expression of rab22a was significantly associated with advanced clinical stage in melanoma.  in the present study, we found that rab22a mrna expression was significantly upregulated in melanoma tissues (including 60 primary melanomas and 84 metastatic melanomas) compared to benign nevi (n = 20), which were significantly higher in metastatic melanoma tissues than primary tissues.  our results confirm that melan-a protein is broadly expressed in the majority of benign and malignant melanocytic lesions and suggest that a103 can be helpful diagnostically, not only for metastatic tumors, but also for primary skin lesions.  ras itself is only infrequently mutated in melanoma although downstream of ras lie braf on the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway and pten on the protein kinase b/akt pathway.  pathway analysis suggests that cdc2, chek1, cdc45l and mcm6 are key players in mediating the biological activity of ra in b16 melanoma cells.  this study aimed to investigate the prognostic value of hras mrna expression in cutaneous melanoma.  although the classic ras-raf-mek pathway is thought to be the main pathway involved in melanoma pathogenesis, genetic alterations in the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-akt pathway, including pten-regulated signaling, are also thought to contribute.  taken together, our study uncovers both activity-dependent and independent mechanisms of arg-ii in promoting melanoma progression.  few studies have focused on the transcriptional level of ras isoforms (kras, nras, and hras) in cutaneous melanoma.  taken these findings together, our study could validate an oncogenic role of rab22a in melanoma, suggesting that rab22a may be a potential therapeutic target for melanoma.  in conclusion, our data showed that transcriptional regulation was different for the three ras isoforms in cutaneous melanoma.  in this study, we analyzed the frequency of braf and nras gene mutations and investigated their association with clinicopathological features of melanomas in the turkish population.  in an analysis of sequential global gene expression changes during a 4-48 h ra treatment of b16 mouse melanoma cells, we found that ra increased the expression of 757 genes and decreased the expression of 737 genes. ||| ",yes
Is RET the major gene involved in Hirschsprung disease?,"the ret proto-oncogene is considered to be the major susceptibility gene involved in hirschsprung disease.  ret is the major gene associated to hirschsprung disease (hscr) with differential contributions of its rare and common, coding and noncoding mutations to the multifactorial nature of this pathology.  although the ret proto-oncogene is the most frequently affected gene in hirschsprung disease, rare coding sequence variants explain only a small part of hirschsprung disease cases.  mutations in the ret gene are the primary cause of hirschsprung disease (hscr), or congenital intestinal aganglionosis.  the ret proto-oncogene is a major cause of hirschsprung's disease (hd) as demonstrated by the experimentally produced intestinal aganglionosis in mice with a null mutation of this gene and by the increased evidence of ret mutations in patients with hd.  as expected, variants in or near ret showed the strongest overall association with hirschsprung disease and the most statistically significant association was observed when using a recessive genetic model (rs2435357, nc_000010.10:g.43582056t > c; genotype tt, or = 17.31, p = 1.462 × 10-21).  the ret proto-oncogene is the major gene involved in the complex genetics of hirschsprung disease (hscr), or aganglionic megacolon, showing causative loss-of-function mutations in 15-30% of the sporadic cases.  the ret proto-oncogene is the major gene involved in the pathogenesis of hirschsprung (hscr), a complex genetic disease characterized by lack of ganglia along variable lengths of the gut.  traditional ret germline mutations account for a small subset of hirschsprung disease patients, but several studies have shown that there is a specific haplotype of ret associated with the sporadic forms of hirschsprung disease.  ret common variants are associated with hirschsprung disease (hscr; colon aganglionosis), a congenital defect of the enteric nervous system.  ret is the major causative gene and contains > 80% of all known disease-causing mutations.  we aimed to assess the genetic background of hirschsprung disease using a genome-wide association analysis combined with sequencing all ret exons in samples from 105 hirschsprung disease cases (30 familial and 75 sporadic) and 386 controls.  hirschsprung disease (hscr) is a complex genetic defect of intestinal innervation mainly ascribed to loss of function mutations of the ret gene.  the pathogenesis of hirschsprung disease is complex.  germline mutations of the ret proto-oncogene (ret), its ligand glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (gdnf), and neurturin (ntn) gene have been reported in patients with hirschsprung's disease.  recent advances show that the ret gene is a major locus involved in the pathogenesis of hscr.  a significant over-transmission of the ""hirschsprung disease haplotype"" was detected when comparing transmitted versus nontransmitted alleles in the group of hirschsprung disease triads without mutation.  because expression of ret mrna plays an important role in establishing the enteric neuronal lineage, decreased ret mrna expression in the aganglionic bowel may suggest maldevelopment of neural crest-derived cells in hirschsprung's disease.  hirschsprung disease (hscr) stands as a model for genetic dissection of complex diseases.  here we present a survey of the different molecular mechanisms through which ret mutations lead to the disease development. ||| ",yes
Is RIP1 (RIP-1) part of the necrosome?,"receptor interacting protein kinase 1 (ripk1/rip1) and rip3 are key components of the necrosome.  rip1 also associates with rip3 to form the necrosome that triggers necroptosis.  necroptosis is a type of programmed necrosis regulated by receptor interacting protein kinase 1 (rip1) and rip3.  in necrosomes, the rip homotypic interaction motif (rhim) of rip3 and rip1 forms amyloidal complex.  necroptosis is a form of programmed necrosis mediated by signaling complexes with receptor-interacting protein 1 (rip1) and rip3 kinases as the main mediators.  as increased rip1 ubiquitination in the necrosome correlates with impaired rip1 and rip3 phosphorylation and function, these results suggest that cyld controls rip1 kinase activity during necrosome assembly.  we further demonstrate that rip1 within the np-40 insoluble necrosome is ubiquitinated and that cyld regulates rip1 ubiquitination in this compartment.  tnfα is a prototypic inducer of necrosome activation, and it is widely believed that deubiquitination of rip1 at the tnfr-1 signaling complex precedes transition of rip1 into the cytosol where it forms the rip1-rip3 necrosome.  it is known that rip1 and rip3 form heterodimeric filamentous scaffold in necrosomes through their rip homotypic interaction motif (rhim) domain-mediated oligomerization, but the signaling events based on this scaffold has not been fully addressed.  necroptosis is mediated by a signaling complex called necrosome, containing receptor-interacting protein (rip)1, rip3, and mixed-lineage kinase domain-like (mlkl).  receptor interacting protein 1 (rip1) has a critical role in initiation of programmed necrosis or necroptosis.  necroptosis is mediated by signaling complexes called necrosomes, which contain receptor-interacting protein 3 (rip3) and upstream effectors, such as rip1.  rip1 in a close collaboration with rip3 not only mediates necroptosis but also is involved in apoptosis and inflammatory signaling.  interestingly, phosphorylation of one of rip3 in the dimer is sufficient to induce necroptosis.  these results strongly suggest that ck1 proteins are necrosome components which are responsible for ripk3-s227 phosphorylation.  by using inducible dimer systems we found that rip1-rip1 interaction is dispensable for necroptosis; rip1-rip3 interaction is required for necroptosis signaling, but there is no necroptosis if no additional rip3 protein is recruited to the rip1-rip3 heterodimer, and the interaction with rip1 promotes the rip3 to recruit other rip3; rip3-rip3 interaction is required for necroptosis and rip3-rip3 dimerization is sufficient to induce necroptosis; and rip3 dimer-induced necroptosis requires mlkl.  under the latter conditions, rip1-rip3 necrosome formation is only delayed, but not abolished in cyld(-/-) cells.  receptor-interacting protein kinase-3 (rip3 or ripk3) is a central protein in necroptosis, but posttranslational processes that regulate rip3 activity and stability remain poorly understood.  receptor interacting protein 1 (rip1), which plays a key role in apoptosis, cell survival and programmed cell necrosis, is one of the most important proteins in the rip family.  we further show that rip3 oligomer is not more potent than rip3 dimer in triggering necroptosis, suggesting that rip3 homo-interaction in the complex, rather than whether rip3 has formed homo polymer, is important for necroptosis. ||| ",yes
Is Rac1 involved in cancer cell invasion?,"rac1 has been shown to regulate the cell cycle in cancer cells.  a large number of aggressive cancer cell lines display elevated levels of activated rac1, a small gtpase widely implicated in cytoskeleton reorganization, cell motility, and metastatic dissemination.  the gtpase rac1 is a well-established master regulator of cell motility and invasiveness contributing to cancer metastasis.  rac-1, which is a member of the rho guanosine triphosphatase (gtpase) family, has been demonstrated to play an important role in cancer invasion and metastasis.  silencing of rac3 inhibited cell invasion and cell migration in lung adenocarcinoma cell lines.  the results in this study indicate, for the first time, that rac-1 is involved in the invasion and metastatic progression of escc and may be a potential marker for evaluating the prognosis of escc patients and a therapy target for escc.  rac1, an intracellular signal transducer, regulates a variety of cell functions, including the organization of the cytoskeleton, cell migration, and invasion.  dysregulation of the rac1 signaling pathway, resulting in elevated motile and invasive potential, has been reported in multiple cancers.  although expression of rac1b alone is insufficient to drive tumor initiation, the expression of rac1b synergizes with an oncogenic allele of k-ras resulting in increased cellular proliferation and accelerated tumor growth.  conclusions: our findings suggest that rac3 regulates cell invasion, migration and emt via p38 mapk pathway.  the rho gtpase rac regulates actin cytoskeleton reorganization to form cell surface extensions (lamellipodia) required for cell migration/invasion during cancer metastasis.  taken together, our data indicate that rac1-gtp is an important player in emt-mediated tumor invasion and a potential therapeutic target for crcs.  overexpression of rac1 has been reported in several human cancers.  rac-1 protein was expressed in 228 (97.85%) cancer tissues with cytoplasm staining, and there were significant correlations between rac-1 expression and tumor location (p = 0.045), tumor stage (p = 0.020), tumor depth (p = 0.023) and lymph node metastasis (p = 0.009).  therefore, rac1 could be a therapeutic target for breast cancer.  nsc23766, an inhibitor of rac1 activity, could also inhibit lung cancer cell migration, invasion and induce rearrangements of the actin cytoskeleton.  rac3 may be a potential biomarker of invasion and metastasis for lung adenocarcinoma, and knockdown of rac3 may potentially serve as a promising therapeutic target for lung adenocarcinoma.  we aimed to study the molecular basis for the specific contribution of rac1 in the progression of colorectal cancer.  rac1 signalling modulates cancer progression since its overexpression leads to an increased tumour growth of xenografts of human colorectal tumour cells, while a drastic reduction of rac1 expression by sirna interferes with cancer progression (espina et al., unpublished results).  rac gtpase-activating protein (racgap) 1 plays a key role in controlling various cellular phenomena including cytokinesis, transformation, invasive migration and metastasis. ||| ",yes
Is Rheumatoid Arthritis related to myopathy?,"rheumatoid myositis (rm) is still poorly characterized, albeit the concept of muscle involvement in rheumatoid arthritis (ra) is well-recognized as being driven by a wide range of causes including inflammation, drugs, impaired joint flexibility, sedentarism.  the overlapping forms of myositis, when the patient also meets the criteria for rheumatoid arthritis (ra), affect 3%-5% of myositis patients .  rheumatoid arthritis (ra) is a disease of unknown etiology that causes irreversible joint destruction and has been known to present with not only various extra-articular symptoms, but also various autoimmune disorders.  rheumatoid arthritis (ra) is an inflammatory autoimmune disease of unknown etiology, affecting mainly the joint but also other tissues.  chronic inflammation of rheumatoid arthritis (ra) is associated with disturbances in muscle and bone metabolism.  these muscle impairments contribute to disability and cardiometabolic disease in rheumatoid arthritis.  prospective study on 23 consecutive rheumatoid arthritis (ra) with muscle involvement as defined by clinical, biological and imagistic parameters.  osteoarthritis is the most common rheumatoid disease.  rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disorder of unknown aetiology.  in rheumatoid arthritis, chronic inflammation, physical inactivity, and medication toxicities impair skeletal muscle.  rheumatoid arthritis skeletal muscle disease in the current era is defined by impaired contractile function (poor strength and endurance) and sarcopenic obesity (decreased muscle mass, increased fat mass, and intramuscular adiposity).  the usual clinical presentation of inflammatory myopathy associated with connective tissue disease is not different from isolated polymyositis or dermatomyositis, i.e., subacute onset of proximal weakness affecting both upper and lower girdle with high serum ck level.  here we report a patient with mctd/myositis overlap syndrome displaying an uncommon clinical presentation and a distribution of muscle weakness involving facial, neck and arm muscles with sparing of lower limbs.  here, we describe a case of mmf which is associated with rheumatoid arthritis.  these skeletal muscle alterations contribute to continued rheumatoid arthritis disparities in physical function and cardiometabolic health.  idiopathic inflammatory myopathies, mainly polymyositis (pm) may occur in the course of several autoimmune diseases.  mostly this is myositis in the context of a connective tissue disease with associated features such as raynaud's phenomenon, arthralgias, pulmonary fibrosis or scleroderma.  in numerous cases, the intensification of inflammatory lesions resembles changes seen in arthritis, particularly in rheumatoid arthritis, which inhibits the differential diagnosis by means of imaging examinations.  the purpose of this study was to investigate whether endocrine regulators of myogenesis and bone metabolism in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (ra) in remission differed from unaffected healthy controls.  the synovitis is probably responsible for the musculoskeletal symptoms in pmr. ||| ",yes
Is Rucaparib effective for ovarian cancer?,"introduction: rucaparib is increasingly being utilized for women with recurrent ovarian cancer both as treatment and maintenance therapy.  rucaparib is a drug with potential as maintenence monotherapy in ovarian cancers irrespective of genetic mutation.  these results support further clinical evaluation of rucaparib either as a single agent or as an adjunct to chemotherapy for the treatment of sporadic ovarian cancer.  to review the pharmacology, safety, efficacy, and the role of rucaparib in the treatment of relapsed, advanced ovarian cancer.  rucaparib as a maintenance treatment showed increased progression-free survival in patients with ovarian carcinoma who achieved a response to platinum-based chemotherapy, with an acceptable safety profile.  across all primary analysis groups, rucaparib significantly improved progression-free survival in patients with platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer who had achieved a response to platinum-based chemotherapy.  rucaparib appears to be a safe and effective new option in the treatment of relapsed, advanced brca1/2 mutant ovarian cancer.  a total of 2 phase i/ii trials and 1 phase ii trial have evaluated the safety and efficacy of oral rucaparib in ovarian cancer.  ovarian cancer patients with highly malignant tumors and relapses on platinum based chemotherapy exhibited statistically significant reductions in tumor size with maintenance rucaparib therapy vis a vis placebo.  rucaparib, a poly(adp-ribose) polymerase inhibitor, has anticancer activity in recurrent ovarian carcinoma harbouring a brca mutation or high percentage of genome-wide loss of heterozygosity.  phase ii and iii trials have documented that rucaparib has single-agent antitumor activity in patients with high-grade ovarian carcinoma, with both brca-mutated (germline and somatic) and with homologous recombination deficiency (hrd).  rucaparib, a polyadpribose polymerase inhibitor (parpi), was approved recently for use in women with high-grade serous ovarian cancer (hgsoc).  in ariel3 (nct01968213), the poly(adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase inhibitor rucaparib significantly improved progression-free survival versus placebo regardless of biomarker status when used as maintenance treatment for recurrent ovarian cancer.  in the current study we investigated the inhibitory effect of rucaparib (rubraca®) on human ovarian cancer skov3 and a2780 cells and its possible mechanism.  here, we investigate the potential role of the parp inhibitor rucaparib (co-338, formerly known as ag014699 and pf-01367338) for the treatment of sporadic ovarian cancer.  in this trial we assessed rucaparib versus placebo after response to second-line or later platinum-based chemotherapy in patients with high-grade, recurrent, platinum-sensitive ovarian carcinoma.  we studied the growth inhibitory effects of rucaparib in a panel of 39 ovarian cancer cell lines that were each characterized for mutation and methylation status of brca1/2, baseline gene expression signatures, copy number variations of selected genes, pten status, and sensitivity to platinum-based chemotherapy.  radiotherapy is highly effective in palliating symptomatic ovarian cancer.  patients with ovarian cancer, fallopian tube cancer and peritoneal cancer that treated with olaparib in the affiliated cancer hospital of nanjing medical university between september 2018 and june 2019 were recruited.  genetic heterogeneity of the tumor did not have an impact upon rucaparib efficacy in ovarian carcinoma. ||| ",yes
Is SLC22A3 expressed in the brain?,"expression and immunostaining studies demonstrated that slc26a11 is abundantly expressed in the cerebellum, with a predominant expression in purkinje cells.  this research has established the mrna expression of syn iii in 22 adult human brain regions as well as the methylation specificity in the closest cpg island of this gene.  slc26a11 (human)/slc26a11 (mouse), also known as kidney brain anion transporter (kbat), is a member of the slc26 anion transporter family and shows abundant mrna expression in the brain.  thus, slc22a2 is associated with phenotypes of net tubular creatinine secretion and esrd.  co-immunofluorescent data showed that clc-3 is mainly distributed in a- and c-type nociceptive neurons.  we examined the effects of the single nucleotide polymorphisms ofslc22a3 on the variability in slc22a3 expression and sebum levels in humans.  slc6a3, which encodes the primary regulator of extracellular dopamine (da) concentration, the da transporter, has been implicated in schizophrenia (scz).  luciferase, knockdown, chromatin immunoprecipitation (chip), electrophoretic mobility shift assay were employed to investigate transcriptional regulation of slc22a3 expression.  slc22a14 is expressed specifically in male germ cells, and mice lacking the slc22a14 gene show severe male infertility.  slc22a23 is an orphan gene in the slc22 family of organic membrane transporters, and its single-nucleotide polymorphism rs17309827-t was recently nominally associated with intestinal inflammation in a genome-wide association study.  we conclude that slc26a11 (kbat) is prominently distributed in output neurons of various subcortical and cortical structures in the central nervous system, with specific expression in purkinje cells and that it may operate as a chloride channel regulating acid translocation by h⁺-atpase across the plasma membrane and in intracellular compartments.  the function of slc16a11 may be related to lipid metabolism.  solute carrier family 22 member 3 (slc22a3), also called organic cation transporter 3 (oct3), is responsible for organic cation transport, which can eliminate many endogenous small organic cations, drugs, and toxins.  this segment of chromosome 22 contains the sulfotransferase-4a1 (sult4a1) gene, which encodes an enzyme thought to be involved in neurotransmitter metabolism in the central nervous system.  as slc22a2 encodes the organic cation transporter 2 (oct2), the association might be due to an effect on tubular creatinine handling.  solute carrier (slc) 16a11 has been reported as a risk gene for type 2 diabetes (t2d).  the purpose of this candidate gene study was to identify a specificslc6a3activity associated with scz by using functional genetic approaches.  we previously identified solute carrier 22a14 (slc22a14) as a spermatogenesis-associated transmembrane protein in mice.  we found that patients with higher slc22a3 expression had longer survival times than those with lower slc22a3 expression (p = 0.051).  here, we show that slc22a14 is crucial for sperm motility and male fertility in mice. ||| ",yes
Is STAT3 involved in EIF2AK2-dependent suppression of autophagy?,"we further showed that phosphorylation of eef2k at ser398 was essential for induction of autophagy, while phosphorylation of the kinase at ser366 and ser78 exerted an inhibitory effect on autophagy.  these results suggest that stat3 contributes to crpc cell survival and chemoresistance by modulating autophagy.  overall, this study reveals a novel regulatory role of the eif2α-atf4 pathway in the fine-tuning of the autophagy gene transcription program in response to stresses.  here, we establish that the eif2α/atf4 pathway directs an autophagy gene transcriptional program in response to amino acid starvation or endoplasmic reticulum stress.  we then investigated the mechanism by which tnfaip3 promotes autophagy signaling.  autophagy is a pro-survival pathway and can be regulated via the protein kinase-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (perk)/eif2α-mediated endoplasmic reticulum (er) stress pathway.  autophagy is inhibited by tor-dependent signaling.  we found that tak1 inhibits p70 s6 kinase1 (s6k1) phosphorylation by interfering interaction of raptor with s6k1, thus inducing autophagy.  transcription factor e3 (tfe3) is reported to be a crucial gene that regulates autophagy flux and lysosome function.  in some models s6k1 activity correlates with autophagy suppression, however, some other studies show that s6k1 promotes rather than inhibits this process.  the molecular mechanism underlying transforming growth factor-β activated kinase 1 (tak1)-induced autophagy is poorly understood.  the inhibition of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mtor) signaling pathway promotes the initiation of autophagy, and the mitogen-activated protein kinase (mapk)/extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (erk) is well known to induce autophagy.  in addition, we show that eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eef-2k) is also required for autophagy signaling during er stress, suggesting that phosphorylation of eef-2 may serve as an integrator of various cell stresses for autophagy signaling.  this study provides the first in vitro and in vivo evidence of tak1-induced autophagy and we believe that our findings significantly contribute to the understanding of the mechanisms underlying the induction of autophagy.  taken together, these findings establish that lysosomal accumulation of akt and phafin2 is a critical step in the induction of autophagy via an interaction with ptdins (3)p.  this study aimed to determine the interaction between autophagy and ire1α-jnk pathway on cell survival in response to er stress during the initial phase of hepatic steatosis.  the phosphorylation of the subunit alpha of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eif2alpha), a critical regulatory event in controlling protein translation, has recently been found to mediate the induction of autophagy.  to explore the molecular mechanisms of autophagy, we investigated the effect of tmp21.  signal transducer and activator of transcription (stat)3 expression is correlated with neoplasm growth, metastasis, and prognosis; it has also been implicated in the regulation of autophagy, which may in turn contribute to tumor chemoresistance.  meanwhile, docetaxel induced autophagy was inhibited by stat3 activation, which increased mitochondrial damage and decreased crpc cell viability. ||| ",yes
Is STAT3 transcription factor regulated by mTORC1?,"here we present evidence for the involvement of stat3, a known mtorc1 regulated transcription factor, in this process.  here we show that the foxo3a transcription factor is coordinately regulated by mtorc1 and mtorc2, and plays a crucial role in controlling cell proliferation.  these results suggest that mtorc1, in coordination with mtorc2, controls cell proliferation by regulating foxo3a gene expression and sgk1-mediated phosphorylation of foxo3a at ser314.  mtorc1 has emerged as a central regulator of cellular metabolism, cell proliferation, cellular differentiation, autophagy and immune response regulation.  mtorc1 coordinates cell growth and metabolism in response to environmental input, including growth factors, amino acid, energy and stress.  we demonstrate that stat3 promotes the transcription of pten by directly binding on the pten promoter.  mtorc1  regulates diverse cell functions.  these findings help explain how mtorc1 selects its substrates, how its kinase activity is controlled, and how it is activated by cancer-associated mutations.  the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mtorc1) is a key metabolic hub that controls the cellular response to environmental cues by exerting its kinase activity on multiple substrates1-3.  we also show that pi3k- and akt-independent pathways mediated by mtorc1 regulate the expression of hif1 (hypoxia-inducible factor 1) transcription factor complex.  in mammals, the transcriptional activity of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (stat3) is regulated by the deacetylase sirt1.  the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mtorc1) controls cell growth and metabolism in response to nutrients, energy levels, and growth factors.  in contrast to mtorc1, mtorc2, which is not well understood, participates in cell survival and the regulation of actin and cytokeratin organization.  mtorc2 mainly controls cell survival and migration through phosphorylating glucocorticoid-regulated kinase (sgk), protein kinase b (akt), and protein kinase c (pkc) kinase families.  mtorc1 (mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1) controls transcriptional programs that determine cd8+ cytolytic t cell (ctl) fate.  the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mtor) functions as a component of two large complexes, mtorc1 and mtorc2, which play crucial roles in regulating cell growth and homeostasis.  consistently, mtorc1 inactivation induced downregulation of serum- and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase 1 (sgk1), the kinase responsible for ser314 phosphorylation.  mtor is the catalytic subunit of mtor complex 1 (mtorc1), which integrates multiple environmental signals to control cell growth and metabolism.  the mammalian target of rapamycin (mtor) is a serine/threonine protein kinase which associates with regulatory-associated protein of tor (raptor), forming the mtorc1 complex, which is necessary for activation of the mtor pathway.  together, our data reveal a novel mechanism of mtorc1 activation that mediates optimal cd8+ t-cell function and antiviral activity. ||| ",yes
Is SUMOylation a post-translational modification in eukaryotes?,"sumoylation is a relevant protein post-translational modification in eukaryotes.  sumoylation, the covalent attachment of a member of the small ubiquitin-like modifier (sumo) family of proteins to lysines in target substrates, is an essential post-translational modification in eukaryotes.  amongst the various post-translational modifications (ptms), sumoylation is a conserved process of attachment of a small ubiquitin-related modifier (sumo) to a protein substrate in eukaryotes.  our results as a whole suggest that sumoylation is a process conserved in the eukaryotic lineage, and that its study is significant for understanding the biology of this interesting parasite and the role of post-translational modification in its evolution.  sumoylation, the conjugation of target proteins with sumo (small ubiquitin-related modifier), is a type of post-translational modification in eukaryotes and involves the sequential action of activation (e1), conjugation (e2) and ligation (e3) enzymes.  sumo, a reversible post-translational protein modifier, plays important roles in many processes of higher eukaryotic cell life.  sumoylation, the post-translational modification of proteins by the addition of sumo, is a highly conserved process that seems to be present in modern cells.  sumoylation is a form of post-translational modification where small ubiquitin-like modifiers (sumo) are covalently attached to target proteins to regulate their properties.  sumoylation is a posttranslational modification in which a member of the small ubiquitin-like modifier (sumo) family of proteins is conjugated to lysine residues in specific target proteins.  sumoylation, the covalent attachment of sumo (small ubiquitin-like modifier), is a eukaryotic post-translational event that has been demonstrated to play a critical role in several biological processes.  sumoylation has emerged as an important post-translational modification that involves the covalent attachment of the small ubiquitin-like modifier (sumo) polypeptide to a lysine residue of a target protein.  post-translational sumoylation, the covalent attachment of a small ubiquitin-like modifier (sumo), regulates the functions of proteins engaged in diverse processes.  sumoylation is an essential post-translational modification that regulates a variety of cellular processes including cell cycle progression.  small ubiquitin-like modifier (sumoylation) is a reversible post-translational modification, which plays important roles in numerous biological processes.  protein modification by sumo (small ubiquitin-related modifier) has emerged as an essential regulatory mechanism in eukaryotes.  sumoylation is an essential ubiquitin-like modification involved in important biological processes in eukaryotic cells.  posttranslational modification of proteins by small ubiquitin-like modifier (sumo) plays essential roles in eukaryotic growth and development.  proteomic studies in other organisms have reported that orthologs of putative t. cruzi sumoylated proteins are similarly modified, indicating conserved functions for protein sumoylation in this early divergent eukaryote.  sumo (small ubiquitin-like modifier) conjugation is a post-translational modification implicated in a variety of cellular functions including transcriptional regulation, nuclear location and signal transduction.  sumoylation, which transfers the small ubiquitin-related modifier (sumo) polypeptides to target proteins, regulates diverse cellular processes in eukaryotes. ||| ",yes
Is Sarcolipin a regulatory/inhibitory protein of the Calcium ATPase SERCA?,"sarcolipin (sln) has been shown recently to uncouple ca transport from adenosine triphosphate hydrolysis by serca.  sarcolipin (sln), a transmembrane peptide, regulates the activity of serca1a by decreasing its ca2+ transport rate, but its mechanism of action is still not well-understood.  sarcolipin (sln), a single-spanning membrane protein, is a regulator of the sarco-endoplasmic reticulum ca2+-atpase (serca1a).  the transmembrane protein sarcolipin regulates calcium storage in the sarcoplasmic reticulum of skeletal and cardiac muscle cells by modulating the activity of sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum ca(2+)-atpases (sercas).  sarcolipin, a homologue of phospholamban, regulates ca2+ uptake through the interaction with sarcoplasmic reticulum ca2+ atpase (serca) and is predominantly expressed in the atrial muscle.  sarcolipin (sln) inhibits the cardiac sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum ca(2+) atpase (serca2a) by direct binding and is superinhibitory if it binds through phospholamban (pln).  sarcolipin (sln) is a key regulator of sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum (sr) ca(2+)-atpase (serca), and its expression is altered in diseased atrial myocardium.  sarcolipin (sln) inhibits the cardiac sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum ca2+ atpase (serca2a) by direct binding and is superinhibitory if it binds as a binary complex with phospholamban (pln).  further solid-state nmr experiments together with functional measurements on serca1a in the presence of nac-rsyqy, a peptide representing the conserved region of sarcolipin, suggest that the peptide binds to the same site as the parent protein at the luminal face of serca1a, where it reduces v(max) for calcium transport and inhibits atp hydrolysis with an ic(50) of approximately 200 microm.  the highly conserved c-terminal region ((27)rsyqy-cooh) of sarcolipin helps to target the protein to the sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane and may also participate in the regulatory interaction between sarcolipin and serca.  the sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum calcium atpase (serca) is regulated in a tissue-dependent manner via interaction with the short integral membrane proteins phospholamban (pln) and sarcolipin (sln).  the sarcoplasmic reticulum (sr) ca2+-atpase (serca2a) is under the control of an sr protein named phospholamban (pln).  sarcolipin (sln), a regulator of the sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum ca(2+)-atpase of fast-twitch skeletal muscle (serca1a), is also expressed in cardiac and slow-twitch skeletal muscles where phospholamban (pln) and serca2a are expressed.  the sarcoplasmic reticulum (sr) ca(2+)-atpase (serca2a) is under the control of a closely associated sr protein named phospholamban (pln).  the sarcoendoplasmic reticulum ca(2+)-atpase (serca) is responsible for intracellular ca(2+) homeostasis.  the sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum ca(2+)-atpase (serca) plays a crucial role in maintaining the ca2+ homeostasis, which itself, controls various essential cellular function.  the sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum ca2+ atpase (serca) actively pumps ca2+ into the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum, thereby regulating intracellular ca2+ concentrations and associated physiological processes.  the sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum ca2+-atpase 2a (serca2a) performs active reuptake of cytoplasmic ca2+ and is a major regulator of cardiac muscle contractility.  serca1a is an atpase calcium pump that transports ca2+ from the cytoplasm to the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum lumen.  ca-atpase regulates intracellular ca levels by pumping ca into sarcoplasmic reticulum. ||| ",yes
Is Solanezumab effective for Alzheimer's Disease?,"solanezumab at a dose of 400 mg administered every 4 weeks in patients with mild alzheimer's disease did not significantly affect cognitive decline.  solanezumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds soluble amyloid beta peptide, is being developed for treatment of alzheimer's disease (ad).  solanezumab treatment was previously shown to significantly increase total (bound + unbound) cerebrospinal fluid (csf) levels of amyloid β (aβ)1-40 and aβ1-42 in patients with mild to moderate alzheimer's disease dementia yet did not produce meaningful cognitive effects.  in the expedition 1 and 2 phase 3 clinical trials, solanezumab was shown to be ineffective in subjects with mild-to-moderate alzheimer's disease, and to have no effect on brain aβ burden.  solanezumab is an anti-amyloid monoclonal antibody in clinical testing for treatment of alzheimer's disease (ad).  solanezumab is a humanized anti-amyloid β monoclonal antibody being developed as a passive immunization treatment to slow the progression of alzheimer disease (ad).  solanezumab (ly2062430) is a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds to the central region of β-amyloid, a peptide believed to play a key role in the pathogenesis of alzheimer's disease (ad).  solanezumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody, preferentially binds soluble forms of amyloid and in preclinical studies promoted its clearance from the brain.  solanezumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds amyloid, failed to improve cognition or functional ability.  solanezumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that preferentially binds to soluble amyloid β and promotes its clearance from the brain in preclinical studies.  solanezumab is a monoclonal antibody that binds to β-amyloid (aβ), a protein that plays a key role in the pathogenesis of ad.  ly2062430 (solanezumab) is a humanized monoclonal antibody being studied as a putative disease-modifying treatment of ad.  in two phase 3, double-blind trials (expedition 1 and expedition 2), we randomly assigned 1012 and 1040 patients, respectively, with mild-to-moderate alzheimer's disease to receive placebo or solanezumab (administered intravenously at a dose of 400 mg) every 4 weeks for 18 months.  acute and subchronic treatment with solanezumab of transgenic mice attenuated or reversed memory deficits with no effects on incidence or severity of cerebral amyloid angiopathy-associated microhemorrhages, a severe side effect associated with bapineuzumab, another monoclonal antibody.  further studies of solanezumab for the treatment of ad are warranted.  in the expedition3 phase 3 trial, participants with mild alzheimer's disease were randomized to receive intravenous infusions of either 400 mg of solanezumab or placebo every 4 weeks for 76 weeks.  solanezumab can neutralize soluble aβ peptides, which may represent the more neurotoxic of the aβ species.  plasma and csf concentrations of solanezumab and amyloid beta (abeta) and cognitive evaluations were obtained.  the humanized monoclonal antibody solanezumab was designed to increase the clearance from the brain of soluble aβ, peptides that may lead to toxic effects in the synapses and precede the deposition of fibrillary amyloid.  selegiline, an irreversible inhibitor of monoamine oxidase b used in the treatment of parkinson's disease, has been demonstrated to have a potential cognition-improving effect in patients with alzheimer's disease (ad) undergoing treatment with an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor donepezil. ||| ",no
Is Stat4 a transcription factor?,"stat4 is a member of the signal transducer and activator of transcription (stat) family of molecules that localizes to the cytoplasm.  signal transducer and activator of transcription 4 (stat4) is a member of the stat family and localizes to the cytoplasm.  stat4 is a transcription factor activated in response to il-12, and is involved in th1 cell development.  stat4 regulates various genes expression as a transcription factor after it is phosphorylated, dimerizes and translocates to the nucleus.  signal transducer and activator of transcription (stat)6 is a transcription factor important for the development of th2 cells and regulation of gene expression by il-4 and il-13.  the stat transcription factor stat4 is a critical regulator of th1 differentiation and inflammatory disease.  stat4 is required for th1 development, although how a transiently activated factor generates heritable patterns of gene expression is still unclear.  these results further substantiate our observation that stat factors can function as transcriptional inhibitors.  the molecular mechanisms controlling the transcription of the stat4 gene are however, unclear.  we have investigated the mechanism by which stat6, through its transactivation domain, induces transcription.  stat (signal transducer and activator of transcription) proteins have been shown to be essential transcription factors which mediate biological effects of cytokines.  our previous studies showed that stat5 functions not only as a transcriptional activator but also as a transcriptional inhibitor, depending on the target promoter.  signal transducers and activators of transcription (stat) are latent transcription factors that participate in cytokine signaling by regulating the expression of early response genes.  the transcription factor stat6 plays a critical role in interleukin-4-dependent gene activation.  stat4 was initially cloned as a result of its homology with stat1 (refs 4, 5) and is widely expressed, although it is only tyrosine-phosphorylated after stimulation of t cells with interleukin (il)-12 (refs 6,7).  the molecular mechanisms by which transcription is selectively activated and precisely controlled by signal transducer and activator of transcription (stat) factors represent a central issue in cytokine-mediated cellular responses.  signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (stat6) has a crucial role in regulation of il-4-induced gene responses.  transcription factor sp4 is a member of the sp1 family.  interleukin-4 (il-4) stimulation leads to the activation of the signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (stat6).  stat6-mediated transcription is depend ent on the c-terminal transcription activation domain (tad), but the mechanisms by which stat6 activates transcription are poorly understood. ||| ",yes
Is TALEN being used on stem cells?,"the therapeutic use of stem cells is a popular topic that is often in the news.  here it is argued that the stem cells we propose for therapeutic application may be more closely related to embryonic cells than are hematopoietic stem cells.  stem cell research has important implications for medicine.  stem cells, which can be derived from different sources, demonstrate promising therapeutic evidences for cellular therapies.  the place of stem cells in the therapeutic armamentarium is currently subject to intense scrutiny.  stem cell research is currently focused on totipotent stem cells and their therapeutic potential, however adult stem cells, while restricted to differentiation within their tissue or origin, also have therapeutic utility.  among various types of stem cell, mesenchymal stem cells are one of the most common stem cells that are used in cellular therapy.  this bears relevance to the future of stem cell research policymaking.  stem cells may be obtained from somatic (adult) cell or embryonic cell origin.  this paper aims to briefly review the current status and potential of using stem cells to repair experimental sci.  transplantation with bone marrow hematopoietic stem cells (hsc) has been used for curative therapy for decades.  stem cell therapy is a potential treatment for spinal cord injury and different stem cell types have been grafted into animal models and humans suffering from spinal trauma.  the use of stem cells in the treatment of traumatic spinal cord injury (sci) in recent years has provided promising results.  a second issue is how the stem cells may best be manipulated for therapeutic use; this includes stem cell purification, amplification, fate selection, and suitability for clinical use.  experimental and clinical studies are currently underway to define the potentials of stem cells in the treatment of sci.  the source of stem cells influences their therapeutic potential, with stem cells derived from early-stage embryos remaining the most versatile.  tendon stem cells (tscs) may be used to effectively repair or regenerate injured tendons.  numbers of stem cell were identified and isolated from embryos, fetuses, or adult organs, harboring different properties, and thus providing multiple strategies of regenerative medicine for different diseases.  due to inconsistent results, it is still an important and clinically relevant question which stem cell type will prove to be therapeutically effective.  stem cell therapy is a relatively novel field of investigation, in which either differentiated cells or stem cells capable of differentiation are transplanted into an individual with the objective of yielding specific cell types in the damaged tissue and consequently restoring its function. ||| ",yes

Is TNNI3K a cardiac-specific protein?,"our data suggest that tnni3k is a cardiac-specific kinase and play important roles in cardiac system.  cardiac troponin i-interacting kinase (tnni3k) is a novel cardiac-specific kinase gene.  tnni3k is an understudied kinase, which is mainly expressed in the heart.  in addition, we review the potential of tnni3k as a target for clinical treatments in different cardiac diseases.  we here provide an overview of the role of tnni3k in cardiomyopathy and arrhythmia covering both a clinical perspective and basic science advancements.  cardiac troponin i-interacting kinase (tnni3k) is a cardiac-specific kinase whose biological function remains largely unknown.  tnni3k is a new cardiac-specific map kinase whose gene is localized to 1p31.1 and that belongs to a tyrosine kinase-like branch in the kinase tree of the human genome.  immunohistochemical analysis predominantly localized tnni3k in the nucleus of cardiac myocytes.  in the two decades since the discovery of tnni3k it has been implicated in multiple cardiac phenotypes and physiological processes.  human cardiac troponin i-interacting kinase (tnni3k) is a novel cardiac-specific functional kinase that can bind to ctni in a yeast two-hybrid screen.  the cardiac troponin i-interacting kinase (tnni3k), a novel cardiac specific kinase, is associated with cardiomyocyte hypertrophy.  molecular cloning of cardiac troponin i-interacting kinase (tnni3k), a novel cardiac-specific protein kinase containing seven n-terminal ankyrin (ank) repeats followed by a protein kinase domain and a c-terminal ser-rich domain, has previously been reported.  we have recently shown that tnni3k expression greatly accelerates cardiac dysfunction in mouse models of cardiomyopathy, indicating an important role in modulating disease progression.  to investigate the role of tnni3k in cardiac hypertrophy, we generated transgenic mouse lines with overexpression of human tnni3k specifically in the heart.  tnni3k could be a potential therapeutic target for preventing from heart failure.  these combined data suggest that tnni3k mediates cell signaling to modulate cardiac response to stress.  we conclude that tnni3k may be a novel mediator of ctni phosphorylation and contribute to the regulation of cardiac myofilament contraction function.  northern blot and 76-tissue array analyses showed that tnni3k is highly expressed in heart, but is undetectable in other tissues.  human genetic variants in tnni3k are associated with supraventricular arrhythmias, conduction disease, and cardiomyopathy.  in the present study we investigated the role of tnni3k in the cardiac myogenesis process and in the repair of ischemic injury. ||| ",yes

Is Tocilizumab effective for Giant-Cell Arteritis?,"our findings show, for the first time in a trial setting, the efficacy of tocilizumab in the induction and maintenance of remission in patients with giant cell arteritis.  tocilizumab, a humanised monoclonal antibody against the interleukin-6 receptor, has been associated with rapid induction and maintenance of remission in patients with giant cell arteritis.  tocilizumab is increasingly used in the treatment of large vessel vasculitis with recent approval for giant cell arteritis.  we therefore aimed to study the efficacy and safety of tocilizumab in the first randomised clinical trial in patients with newly diagnosed or recurrent giant cell arteritis.  a total of 11 patients were treated with tocilizumab (8 giant cell arteritis, 2 large vessel vasculitis associated with rheumatoid arthritis, 1 takayasu arteritis) after a median of 2 other steroid-sparing agents (range 1-4).  tocilizumab is efficacious in patients with large vessel vasculitis in a real-life situation.  tocilizumab (tcz), an il-6 receptor blocker, is approved for relapsing, refractory giant cell arteritis (gca).  between march 3, 2012, and sept 9, 2014, 20 patients were randomly assigned to receive tocilizumab and prednisolone, and ten patients to receive placebo and glucocorticoid; 16 (80%) and seven (70%) patients, respectively, had new-onset giant cell arteritis.  tocilizumab (tcz) has been used to effectively treat large vessel vasculitis.  tocilizumab, an anti-interleukin-6 receptor antibody, was investigated in patients with refractory takayasu arteritis (tak) in a phase 3 randomized controlled trial.  to determine the efficacy and safety of tocilizumab in large vessel vasculitis in a real-life setting using different routes of administration.  tocilizumab (actemra) is a humanized anti-interleukin-6 receptor antibody that has been used as a steroid-sparing agent in giant cell arteritis (gca).  furthermore, a large amount of case study data reveals that tocilizumab can be an effective therapy for not only rheumatoid arthritis but also for other mostly rare inflammatory rheumatic diseases.  retrospective analysis of consecutive patients at a tertiary rheumatology department who received tocilizumab for large vessel vasculitis.  in this single centre, phase 2, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, we recruited patients aged 50 years and older from university hospital bern, switzerland, who met the 1990 american college of rheumatology criteria for giant cell arteritis.  tocilizumab is a highly effective therapeutic agent for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis.  this article reviews the efficacy and tolerability of tocilizumab in these patients and briefly summarizes its pharmacology.  several large well-designed clinical trials and routine clinical practice studies showed that tocilizumab was an effective and generally well tolerated biologic for the treatment of adults with ra, including those with an inadequate response to dmards or tnfα antagonists.  giant cell arteritis is an immune-mediated disease of medium and large-sized arteries that affects mostly people older than 50 years of age.  giant cell arteritis (gca) is the most common form of systemic vasculitis in adults, affecting preferentially medium-large size arteries. ||| ",yes
Is Tofacitinib effective for Ulcerative Colitis?,"here, we examined the safety and efficacy of tofacitinib in active ulcerative colitis (uc).  tofacitinib, a pan-jak inhibitor, showed efficacy in ulcerative colitis  and has been approved for the treatment of patients with moderate to severe uc.  tofacitinib is a partially selective janus kinase inhibitor approved for the treatment of refractory moderate to severe ulcerative colitis .  tofacitinib, a novel, oral janus kinase inhibitor, demonstrated a dose-dependent efficacy for induction of clinical response and remission in patients with active ulcerative colitis (uc).  tofacitinib is a janus kinase inhibitor indicated to treat adult patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (uc).  tofacitinib is an oral, small-molecule janus kinase inhibitor for the treatment of ulcerative colitis (uc).  thus, our findings suggest that tofacitinib is quite effective in protecting from colitis by inhibition of a bundle of t cell derived cytokines like il-5, il-6, il-9, il-13 and il-17a.  tofacitinib is a first-in-class, partially selective inhibitor of janus kinase, recently approved for treating patients with ulcerative colitis (uc).  here, we analysed the inhibitory effect of tofacitinib on mucosal and blood t cells from patients with ulcerative colitis (uc).  tofacitinib is an oral, small-molecule inhibitor of jak approved in several countries for the treatment of ulcerative colitis (uc).  tofacitinib is an oral, small molecule inhibitor of jak for the treatment of ulcerative colitis (uc).  tofacitinib is an oral, small molecule janus kinase (jak) inhibitor for the treatment of ulcerative colitis (uc).  in 2018, the pan-janus kinase (jak) inhibitor tofacitinib was launched for the treatment of ulcerative colitis (uc).  application of tofacitinib emerges as an attractive concept for treatment of chronic intestinal inflammation at lower concentrations, whereas higher concentrations require attention due to prolonged wound healing.  although the clinical efficacy of tofacitinib in patients with ulcerative colitis (uc) has been assessed in the octave trial, there is a lack of adequate data on its efficacy in real-world clinical settings.  we describe our experience with the use of tofacitinib for treatment of patients with moderate-to-severe ibd.  tofacitinib suppressed acute and chronic oxazolone colitis compared to untreated wild-type mice associated with downregulation of cytokines produced by th2, th9 and th17 cells.  tofacitinib is a promising therapeutic agent for the induction and maintenance therapy in uc.  to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of tofacitinib in comparison to vedolizumab for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis (uc) after failure or intolerance to conventional therapy (bio-naive) or first-line biologic treatment (bio-experienced), from the spanish national health system (nhs) perspective.  although tofacitinib has proven efficacious in patients with active uc, it failed in patients with crohn's disease (cd). ||| ",yes
Is Tuberous Sclerosis a genetic disease?,"tuberous sclerosis (ts) is a rare genetic disorder of autosomal-dominant inheritance.  tuberous sclerosis (ts) is a relatively rare, autosomal dominant syndrome that displays high genetic penetrance in affected families.  tuberous sclerosis is a single-gene disorder caused by heterozygous mutations in the tsc1 (9q34) or tsc2 (16p13.3) gene and is frequently associated with mental retardation, autism and epilepsy.  tuberous sclerosis is a developmental genetic disorder caused by mutations in tsc1, which results in epilepsy, autism, and intellectual disability.  tuberous sclerosis is a relatively common inherited disease that causes multiple benign tumours in different organs, frequently leading to skin rashes, seizures and mental handicap.  here we review the current state of knowledge of the molecular genetics of tuberous sclerosis and the spectrum of mutations seen in and the implications of recent findings for patients.  tuberous sclerosis is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder that is characterized by the early development of hamartomas, malformations, and congenital tumors of the nervous system, skin, kidneys, lungs, and heart.  tuberous sclerosis complex is a rare autosomal dominant disorder caused by mutations in either of tsc1 and tsc2 genes.  tuberous sclerosis (tsc) is an autosomal dominant disorder, caused by mutations of either the tsc1 or tsc2 gene.  tuberous sclerosis (tsc) is caused by a mutation in either the tsc1 or tsc2 gene.  tuberous sclerosis (tsc) is a single-gene disorder caused by heterozygous mutations in the tsc1 or tsc2 gene.  tuberous sclerosis is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by involvement of skin, nervous system, kidneys, and lungs.  tuberous sclerosis complex is an autosomal dominant multi-system disorder with an incidence of about 1 in 6000 live births.  tuberous sclerosis (tsc) is an autosomal dominant disorder with both neurological and cutaneous manifestations often resulting in significant disability.  tuberous sclerosis complex (tsc), a heritable neurodevelopmental disorder, is caused by mutations in the tsc1 or tsc2 genes.  tuberous sclerosis complex (tsc) is a rare autosomal-dominant disorder caused by mutations in the tsc1 or tsc2 genes.  tuberous sclerosis complex is an autosomal dominant disease of benign tumors occurring in multiple organ systems of the body.  tuberous sclerosis (tsc) is a human genetic syndrome characterized by the development of benign tumors in a variety of tissues, as well as rare malignancies.  tuberous sclerosis complex presents diverse clinical characteristics, and either of tsc1 and tsc2 genes shows a wide range of mutations in their coding regions.  we describe the clinical characteristics of a chinese family with tsc1 gene mutation and present a literature review of chinese patients with tuberous sclerosis complex gene mutation reported since 2004. ||| ",yes
Is Turcot syndrome associated with glioblastoma?,"turcot syndrome (ts) is a rare genetic disorder of dna mismatch repair predisposing to glioblastoma (gbm) in the type 1 variant.  here we describe three patients with turcot's syndrome, each having colorectal adenocarcinoma and malignant glioma.  turcot syndrome (ts) or the glioma-polyposis syndrome, is a rare, heritable disorder thought by some authors to be a variant of familial adenomatous polyposis (fap).  turcot's syndrome or the glioma polyposis syndrome is a rare variant of the polyposis syndrome and it is characterized by colonic polyposis and central nervous system neoplasm typically a glioblastoma or a medulloblastoma.  patients with turcot syndrome (ts) are predisposed to colon tumors and primary brain tumors, typically glioblastomas or medulloblastomas.  turcot's syndrome is a rare hereditary disease in which malignant glioma of the central nervous system is associated with colonic polyposis.  turcot syndrome represents the unique and discrete occurrence of polyposis coli with glioblastoma multiforme, medulloblastoma, or both.  turcot syndrome (ts) is a rare genetic disease in which brain tumors occur in association with colonic polyposis.  turcot's syndrome, the association of brain tumor (usually glioblastoma, medullo-blastoma, or astrocytoma) and colonic polyps, is a very rare condition of which about 20 cases have been reported.  turcot syndrome is characterized by an association of malignant brain tumors and colon cancer developing in the patient's teens.  turcot syndrome is clinically characterized by the occurrence of primary brain tumor and colorectal tumor and has, in previous reports, been shown associated with germline mutations in the genes apc, mlh1, mhs6, and pms2.  the turcot syndrome is a rare disease which is characterized by a combination of a brain tumor with a y at which the neoplasm of the colon.  turcot's syndrome represents the association between familial multiple polyposis coli and neural tumors.  turcot's syndrome is characterized clinically by the occurrence of primary brain tumor and colorectal tumor and has in previous reports been shown to be associated with germline mutations in the genes apc, hmlh1, and hpms2.  turcot's syndrome is a rare, genetically transmittable disease in which patients with colonic polyposis (possibly complicated by the progression to adenocarcinoma) have malignant central nervous system neoplasms.  turcot's syndrome is characterized clinically by the concurrence of a primary brain tumor and multiple colorectal adenomas.  multiple cns tumors are extremely unusual in turcot's syndrome.  turcot's syndrome is a combination of multiple adenomatous gastrointestinal polyps and neuroepithelial tumors of the central nervous system (cns).  we present a case of turcot's syndrome in a child with malignant transformation.  we report two new families with turcot syndrome to illustrate and review its characteristics and facilitate diagnosis. ||| ",yes
Is Vitamin D deficiency in pregnant women associated with gestational diabetes?,"vitamin d deficiency in pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of gestational diabetes mellitus (gdm) and neonatal vitamin d deficiency.  lower vitamin d status in early pregnancy was associated with a significantly increased risk of subsequent gestational diabetes that was independent of race, age, season and maternal weight.  vitamin d deficiency is highly prevalent amongst pregnant women and is linked to a range of adverse complications, including gestational diabetes.  this study suggests that vitamin d may influence glucose tolerance during pregnancy and provides support for studies of vitamin d as a potential intervention to prevent gestational diabetes.  the beneficial effects of vitamin d on gestational diabetes have been shown, though data on the effects of co-administration of vitamin d with other nutrients on pregnancy outcomes in gestational diabetes (gdm) are scarce.  gestational diabetes mellitus (gdm) is often accompanied by low maternal vitamin d, that is, calcitriol (1,252 vitamin d3), levels.  the objective of this study was to determine the impact of vitamin d deficiency on maternal complications like gestational diabetes mellitus (gdm), anemia, iron deficiency, and preeclampsia among pregnant women.  the aim of this study was to determine whether low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin d in early pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of gestational diabetes mellitus.  vitamin d deficiency is common in pregnancy, leading to increase in the frequency of preeclampsia, cesarean delivery, neonatal bacterial vaginosis, and gestational diabetes.  this study was assigned to evaluate relation between serum vitamin d level and insulin resistance in gestational diabetes mellitus (gdm).  this review shows evidence that vitamin d supplementation has the potential to promote glycaemic control in women with gestational diabetes mellitus (gdm).  vitamin d deficiency also is common in pregnancy.  maternal low birthweight and vitamin d deficiency in pregnancy are associated with a similar spectrum of adverse pregnancy outcomes including pre-eclampsia and gestational diabetes.  the current study was designed and implemented to investigate the effect of vitamin d during the first and second trimesters of pregnancy in reducing the risk of gestational diabetes mellitus (gdm) in women who are at high risk .  this study compared serum levels of 25-hydroxy vitamin d(3) in pregnant women with gestational diabetes mellitus (gdm), impaired glucose tolerance (igt), and non-gdm control subjects.  these results suggested that rates of vitamin d deficiency are higher among women with igt/gdm, and the relationship between vitamin d status and glucose tolerance in pregnancy needs further study.  vitamin d was not significantly decreased in gdm compared to controls during pregnancy; however, both groups of pregnant women exhibited high prevalence of vitamin d deficiency.  the study findings revealed that maternal vitamin d deficiency in pregnancy is significantly associated with elevated risk for gdm, anemia, and preeclampsia.  women with gestational diabetes had significantly lower serum 25-hydroxyvitamin d compared with control subjects (56.3 vs. 62.0 nmol/l, p = 0.018).  this nested case-control study examined the association between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin d and risk of gestational diabetes within a cohort of pregnant women from march 2008 to december 2009, who had undergone antenatal screening between 15 and 18 weeks gestation and subsequent glucose tolerance testing. ||| ",yes
Is Vortioxetine effective for treatment of depression?,"clinical studies indicate that vortioxetine is effective in the treatment of major depression, though there is no suggestion of superiority over active comparators.  vortioxetine is a novel antidepressant capable of improving depressive and cognitive symptoms associated with major depressive disorder (mdd).  objective is to evaluate if new antidepressant vortioxetine may be a potential treatment option.  vortioxetine is a multimodal antidepressant approved for treatment of major depressive disorder.  antidepressant efficacy in major depressive disorder has been established in registration studies, but the effectiveness of vortioxetine in 'real world' patients and in comparison to other antidepressants needs further investigation.  at present, vortioxetine can be considered as an antidepressant option in patients with established major depressive disorder who have not responded adequately to other antidepressants.  vortioxetine is a potent antagonist of the 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor and serotonin transporter and has been reported to function as an antidepressant in the treatment of major depressive disorder.  vortioxetine is approved for the treatment of major depressive disorder and differs from other antidepressants in terms of its pharmacodynamic profile.  vortioxetine is a novel multimodal antidepressant that has improved cognitive function including executive function in depressed patients in randomised placebo-controlled clinical trials.  vortioxetine is approved for the treatment of major depressive disorder (mdd).  additionally, vortioxetine has beneficial effects on aspects of cognitive dysfunction in depressed patients.  conclusion : the mechanism of action, the efficacy on depression and safety profile and early data on cognitive impairment make vortioxetine a strong candidate for use in depression associated with cerebrovascular disease.  vortioxetine has also been shown to alleviate cognitive symptoms in preclinical studies and in patients with depression.  preclinical and clinical observations showed that vortioxetine (vort, an antidepressant with multimodal activity), presents beneficial effects on aspects of cognitive function.  this paper aims to provide clinicians with a brief overview of vortioxetine and its place in treatment.  vortioxetine is a well tolerated treatment, showing statistically lower withdrawal rates due to aes compared with other antidepressants.  to assess the relative efficacy and tolerability of vortioxetine against different antidepressant monotherapies in patients with major depressive disorder (mdd) with inadequate response to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (ssri) or serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (snri) therapy.  secondary results indicate numerical benefits for cognitive performance with vortioxetine monotherapy, and for depressive symptoms with vortioxetine augmentation.  vortioxetine has been registered by regulatory authorities for the treatment of major depressive disorder.  vortioxetine and duloxetine are two new antidepressant drugs that have been used clinically in the treatment of major depressive disorder (mdd). ||| ",yes
Is Weaver syndrome similar to Sotos?,"considerable phenotypic overlap between sotos and weaver syndromes is also evident.  some of the manifestations characterize both the weaver and sotos syndrome, and distinction between the two is mainly by clinical examination and molecular testing.  weaver syndrome is a congenital paediatric syndrome characterized by mental, respiratory and musculoskeletal manifestations.  two cases in the literature- referred to as weaver syndrome- exhibited nearly identical anomalies.  we conclude that intragenic mutations of nsd1 are the major cause of sotos syndrome and account for some weaver syndrome cases but rarely occur in other childhood overgrowth phenotypes.  differentiating features from weaver syndrome are discussed, and autosomal recessive inheritance is suggested.  we conclude therefore that nsd1 mutations account for most cases of sotos syndrome and a significant number of weaver syndrome cases in our series.  she has camptodactyly which has not previously been reported in sotos syndrome but is a common finding in weaver syndrome.  a 3-year old girl was admitted in our department with typical manifestations of weaver syndrome, associated with congenital dislocation of bilateral hips, hypoplastic talus and subtalar dislocation of her right ankle.  weaver syndrome (ws) is a rare congenital disorder characterized by generalized overgrowth, macrocephaly, specific facial features, accelerated bone age, intellectual disability, and susceptibility to cancers.  most of the patients with sotos syndrome have nsd1 gene deletions or mutations; however, the molecular basis of most of the weaver syndrome patients is unknown.  this paper reports the first female case of the weaver syndrome.  weaver syndrome is a rare overgrowth syndrome with distinct facial features in young children and variable learning disability.  weaver syndrome (ws), a condition first described in 1974 by weaver et al., consists of macrosomia, advanced skeletal age, characteristic pattern of facial and radiographic anomalies, and contractures.  we report on a 25-year-old woman who was diagnosed with weaver syndrome after reevaluation because of the family's concern regarding recurrence risk for mental retardation in offspring of the woman's brother.  weaver syndrome is a rare condition characterized by overgrowth, macrocephaly, accelerated osseous maturation, variable intellectual disability, and characteristic facial features.  some degree of phenotypic overlap exists with other overgrowth syndromes, in particular with weaver syndrome.  whether this boy showed a milder expression of the weaver syndrome or benign familial macrocephaly is discussed.  weaver syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder comprising accelerated growth rate and rapidly advancing skeletal maturation.  half brothers with classical childhood findings of weaver syndrome and their father with minimal clinical findings showed cervical spine anomalies that likely represent a consistent radiographic finding in this disorder. ||| ",yes
Is Wnt16b secreted in response to chemotherapy?,"in this study, we found wnt16b could be expressed and secreted into the microenvironment by human ovarian fibroblasts after dna damage-associated treatment, including chemotherapy drugs and radiation.  these results shed light on the roles of wnt16b in immune regulation, especially in regard to cancer treatment.  activation of the wnt signaling in some types of cancer and its relation with chemotherapy resistance is a very interesting issue that has been emphasized in recent years.  however, whether the wnt/β‑catenin pathway plays a role in resistance to antitumor chemotherapy drugs remains unknown.  wnt2 is implicated in various human cancers.  here, we demonstrate that the wnt inhibitory factor 1 (wif1), a secreted wnt antagonist, is downregulated in all human primary cervical tumors and cell lines analyzed.  here we found that wnt2 is highly expressed in colorectal cancer (crc) cells.  these results clarified for the first time the possibility that wnt5a plays an important role in regulating chemosensitivity to anticancer drugs in ovarian cancer cells.  however, it is still unclear whether wnt5a is involved in mediating chemoresistance in cancer.  treatment for cancer can induce a series of secreted factors into the tumor microenvironment, which can affect cancer progression.  thus, wif1 causes a major cellular re-distribution of β-catenin and a significant inhibition of the wnt/β-catenin pathway in tumor cells, as documented by a remarkable reversion in the expression of wnt/β-catenin transcriptional target genes (e-cadherin, c-myc, cyclin d1, cd44 and vegf).  wnt5a expression was immunohistochemically examined in ovarian cancer, benign tumor, and normal ovarian tissues.  anaberrant wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway is frequently implicated in tumorigenesis.  similarly, neutralizing secreted wnt2 reduces wnt target gene expression and suppresses crc cell proliferation.  wingless-type mmtv (mouse mammary tumor virus) integration site 16b (wnt16b) is a new member of the wnt family and has been reported to play growth-related roles in previous studies.  in an in vivo study, this monoclonal anti-wnt-2 antibody suppresses tumor growth in a xenograft model.  deregulations or mutations of wnt/β-catenin signaling have been associated to both tumour formation and progression.  wif1 treatment causes a significant decrease in intracellular wnt1 and tcf-4 proteins revealing novel wnt-regulatory mechanisms.  aberrant wnt signaling drives a number of cancers through regulation of diverse downstream pathways.  in cells derived from the same tumor, we demonstrated that the prevalence of lef1 (high β-catenin expressing cells) or tcf4 (low β-catenin expressing cells) as β-catenin partner for dna binding, is associated to the expression of two distinct profiles of wnt-responsive genes. ||| ",yes
Is a CpG island methylator phenotype involved in ependymomas?,"we determined the frequency of aberrant cpg island methylation of several tumor-associated genes: p16(ink4a), rb1, mgmt, dapk, timp3, thbs1, tp73, nf2 and caspase 8 in a group of 27 ependymomas, consisting of 22 who grade ii samples and five anaplastic who grade iii tumors.  dna methylation changes are likely to have biological importance in ependymomas.  our findings suggest that methylation commonly contributes to the inactivation of cancer-related genes in ependymomas.  hypermethylation of promoter cpg islands is a common epigenetic event in a variety of human cancers.  taken together, we conclude that hypermethylation of cpg islands is a common epigenetic event that is associated with the development of oligodendroglial tumors.  the aim of the present study is to investigate the relationship between the methylation status and clinicopathological parameters in ependymomas.  aberrant methylation of promoter cpg islands in human genes is an alternative genetic inactivation mechanism that contributes to the development of human tumors.  we conclude that there is a general deregulation of cpg island methylation in leukemia and that hypermethylation is not limited to single genes, but a number of genes are methylated concurrently.  supratentorial and spinal tumors displayed significantly more hypermethylated genes than posterior fossa tumors, similar to the 'cpg island methylator phenotype' (cimp) identified in glioma and colon carcinoma.  aberrant methylation of promoter cpg islands in human genes represents an alternative mechanism for genetic inactivation, and contributes to the development of human tumors.  tumors with a cpg island methylator phenotype (cimp), a distinct subgroup with extensive dna methylation, show characteristic features in the case of colorectal cancer.  the mechanisms underlying ectopic methylation of cpg islands in neoplastic cells are poorly understood.  hypermethylation in cancer often occurs in cpg islands that span the promoter regions of tumor suppressor genes.  the nonrandom pattern of increased cpg island methylation in the hybrid cell lines suggests that locus-specific features and/or clonal selection, and not just dna mtase expression, affect the evolution of ectopic methylation in neoplastic cells.  methylation status of core regions in promoter cpg islands was examined for 20 (candidate) tumor-suppressor genes, 4 genes that are not considered as tumor-suppressors, but are frequently silenced in human cancers, and 6 normally methylated melanoma antigen genes (mages).  the cpg island methylator phenotype (cimp or cimp-high) with widespread promoter methylation is a distinct epigenetic phenotype in colorectal cancer.  aberrant de novo methylation of cpg island dna sequences has been observed in cultured cell lines or upon malignant transformation, but the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are poorly understood.  our results showed that hypermethylation of cpg islands was detectable in 8 of 11 genes studied and 74% of tumors were hypermethylated in at least 1 gene.  the cpg island methylator phenotype (cimp or cimp-high) with widespread promoter methylation is a distinct phenotype in colorectal cancer.  concurrent dna methylation of multiple genes occurs in endometrial cancer and is referred to as the cpg island methylator phenotype (cimp). ||| ",yes
Is a mutation of the  ZIKV's membrane protein prM responsible for the microcephaly in new-born infants?,"the recent zika virus (zikv) epidemic is associated with microcephaly in newborns.  zika virus (zikv) infection is associated with microcephaly in fetuses, but the pathogenesis of zikv-related microcephaly is not well understood.  congenital microcephaly occurs in utero during zika virus (zikv) infection.  zika virus (zikv) can cause microcephaly in the fetus.  identification of risk factors for ophthalmoscopic findings in infants born with microcephaly and zikv intrauterine infection.  to assess and identify possible risk factors for ophthalmoscopic findings in infants born with microcephaly and a presumed clinical diagnosis of zikv intrauterine infection.  a small percentage of babies born to zika virus (zikv)-infected mothers manifest severe defects at birth, including microcephaly.  zika virus (zikv) infection of neural progenitor cells (npcs) in utero is associated with neurological disorders, such as microcephaly, but a detailed molecular understanding of zikv-induced pathogenesis is lacking.  zika virus (zikv) infection during pregnancy is associated with microcephaly, a congenital malformation resulting from neuroinflammation and direct effects of virus replication on the developing central nervous system (cns).  the recent zika virus (zikv) epidemic in latin america coincided with a marked increase in microcephaly in newborns.  maternal zika virus (zikv) infection during pregnancy is recognized as the cause of an epidemic of microcephaly and other neurological anomalies in human fetuses.  apoptosis of neural progenitor cells induced by zikv infection is believed to be a main reason for zikv infection-related microcephaly.  after the discovery that zika virus (zikv) could cause microcephaly and other birth defects, we have scrambled to understand how.  the zika virus (zikv) might cause microcephaly and ophthalmoscopic findings in infants of mothers infected during pregnancy.  overall, our findings suggest that relative to their unexposed peers, zikv-exposed children without microcephaly are not at considerably increased risk of neurodevelopmental impairment in the first 42 months of life, although a small group of children demonstrated higher frequencies of cognitive delay.  the relation of zika virus (zikv) with microcephaly is well established.  now, spreading along with the virus is misinformation that a zikv mutation is responsible for microcephaly.  the most notable effect of prenatal zika virus (zikv) infection is severe microcephaly.  zika virus (zikv) infection during pregnancy may be linked to fetal neurological complications that include brain damage and microcephaly.  they also suggest that immune activation after zikv infection may play an important role in the pathogenesis of zikv-related microcephaly. ||| ",yes
Is abdominal pain a common symptom in autism?,"individuals with autism spectrum disorder are more likely than typically developing individuals to experience a range of gastrointestinal abnormalities, including chronic diarrhea, constipation, food sensitivities, and abdominal pain.  there is an emerging body of evidence associating children having autism spectrum disorder (asd) with gastrointestinal (gi) symptoms, such as abdominal pain, chronic diarrhea, constipation, vomiting, gastroesophageal reflux, intestinal infections, and increased intestinal permeability.  this study confirms previously reported findings of an increase in bowel symptoms in children with autism.  increased severity of autism spectrum disorder symptoms was correlated with increased gastrointestinal symptom severity.  we investigated the relationship between autism spectrum disorder symptom severity and gastrointestinal symptoms while accounting for three associated behavioral symptom domains (irritability, aggressiveness, and specific fears), in a sample of 176 children (140 males and 36 females) ages 2-7 years old with autism spectrum disorder.  recent research has suggested that autism spectrum disorder (asd) and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (adhd) may be comorbid to pediatric chronic pain, but the empirical support is yet scarce.  evidence is accumulating that recurrent abdominal pain (rap) in children is associated with visceral hyperalgesia.  these gastrointestinal symptoms have been associated with higher levels of irritability and aggressive behavior, but less is known about their relationship with core autism spectrum disorder symptoms.  there was a significant difference in the reporting of certain bowel symptoms (constipation, diarrhoea, flatulence) and food faddiness between the autism group and the mainstream school control group.  anxiety and depression are implicated as contributors to abdominal pain in pediatric irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) but is unclear if this pain is associated with other psychological factors.  frequent abdominal pain (ap) in children and adolescents is often designated as functional gastrointestinal disorder.  abdominal pain and other gastrointestinal symptoms are common presenting features of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (mis-c) and can overlap with infectious or inflammatory abdominal conditions, making accurate diagnosis challenging.  it would appear, however, that this is not specifically associated with autism as bowel symptoms were reported in similar frequency to a comparison group of children with other developmental and neurological disorders.  individuals with autism spectrum disorder (asd) often exhibit differences in pain responsivity.  the abdominal wall is an often overlooked source of pain in children with chronic abdominal pain.  using a bowel symptom questionnaire we compared 51 children with autism spectrum disorder with control groups of 35 children from special school and 112 from mainstream school.  asthma at 1 and 2 years and food hypersensitivity at 8 years were significantly associated with abdominal pain at 12 years.  this review suggests that contrary to classical reports, individuals with autism spectrum disorder do not appear to have systematically altered pain responses or thresholds.  signs of pain-related distress).  more systematic experimental examination of this area is needed to understand responses to pain of individuals with autism spectrum disorder. ||| ",yes
Is acid alpha-glucosidase the enzyme that causes Pompe disease when mutant?,"pompe disease is caused by autosomal recessive mutations in the acid alpha-glucosidase (gaa) gene, which encodes gaa.  pompe disease (pd) is an autosomal recessive lysosomal disorder caused by the deficient activity of acid alpha-glucosidase (gaa) enzyme due to mutations in the gaa gene.  pompe disease (pd) is an autosomal recessive metabolic disorder caused by pathogenic variants in the acid α-glucosidase gene (gaa) that produces defects in the lysosomal acid α-1,4-glucosidase.  pompe disease (omim 232300) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the gene encoding acid α-glucosidase (gaa) (ec 3.2.1.20), the enzyme responsible for hydrolyzing lysosomal glycogen.  pompe disease is a lysosomal storage disorder caused by autosomal recessive mutations in the acid alpha-glucosidase (gaa) gene.  pompe's disease is a neuromuscular disorder caused by deficiency of lysosomal acid alpha-glucosidase.  pompe disease is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by deficiency of the lysosomal glycogen-hydrolyzing enzyme acid α-glucosidase (gaa).  pompe disease is an autosomal recessive lysosomal glycogen storage disorder caused by the deficiency of acid alpha-glucosidase and subsequent progressive glycogen accumulation due to mutations in the gaa gene.  pompe disease is a rare inherited metabolic disorder of defective lysosomal glycogen catabolism due to a deficiency in acid alpha-glucosidase (gaa).  pompe disease is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by a deficiency of acid alpha-glucosidase resulting in intralysosomal glycogen accumulation in multiple tissue types, especially cardiac, skeletal, and smooth muscle.  pompe disease is an autosomal recessive disorder of glycogen metabolism that is characterized by a deficiency of the lysosomal acid alpha-glucosidase.  pompe disease is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by a deficiency in 1,4-alpha-glucosidase (ec.3.2.1.3), the enzyme required to hydrolyze lysosomal glycogen to glucose.  pompe disease results from lysosomal acid α-glucosidase (gaa) deficiency and its associated glycogen accumulation and muscle damage.  pompe disease is an autosomal recessive glycogen storage disorder caused by a deficiency of the lysosomal glycogen-hydrolyzing enzyme acid α-glucosidase.  pompe disease (glycogen storage disease type ii, gsd ii, acid alpha-glucosidase deficiency, acid maltase deficiency, omim # 232300) is an autosomal-recessive lysosomal storage disorder due to a deficiency of acid alpha-glucosidase (gaa, acid maltase, ec 3.2.1.20, swiss-prot p10253).  in a cross-sectional single-centre study we clinically assessed 3 patients with classic infantile pompe disease and 39 patients with non-classic presentations, measured their acid alpha-glucosidase activities and analysed their gaa genes.  pompe disease is caused by the accumulation of glycogen in the lysosomes due to a deficiency of the lysosomal acid-α-glucosidase (gaa) enzyme.  the determination of acid alpha-glucosidase activity in dried-blood spots is a useful, noninvasive diagnostic assay for the identification of pompe disease.  pompe-affected individuals showed an almost total absence of acid alpha-glucosidase activity in blood spots.  currently, the clinical diagnosis of pompe disease is confirmed by the virtual absence, in infantile onset, or a marked reduction, in juvenile and adult onset, of acid alpha-glucosidase activity in muscle biopsies and cultured fibroblasts. ||| ",yes

Is aganglionic megacolon a feature of Down syndrome?,"one of the children with down's syndrome and total colonic aganglionosis died.  a case of acquired neurogenic megacolon in a child is reported.  hirschsprung's disease (hd) also called congenital aganglionic megacolon is a disorder caused by undeveloped distal to proximal intestinal nerve ganglion cells.  megacolon, the irreversible dilation of a colonic segment, is a structural sign associated with various gastrointestinal disorders.  down syndrome (ds) is recognized by characteristic facial features, intellectual disability, and an increased risk for cardiac malformations and duodenal atresia.  recently, hirschsprung disease (hscr), or congenital aganglionic megacolon, has been seen more often among patients with ds.  more recently, an association between down syndrome and achalasia was reported.  in this report, we describe a 48-year-old woman with a history of down syndrome who presented with dysphagia.  hirschsprung's disease, or congenital megacolon,is a malformation characterised by the absence of ganglion cells in the distal bowel.  down's syndrome is the most frequent chromosomal anomaly in humans and is associated with an incidence of anorectal anomalies many times greater than that found among the general population.  2 patients had a long colonic aganglionosis, 2 patients had a short aganglionotic segment and 13 patients had the common form of the disease.  dysganglionosis and aganglionosis have been frequently described in biopsies of the distal bowel in patients with anorectal malformation (arm).  the true association of total colonic aganglionosis and anorectal malformation has not been reported before.  aganglionosis was confirmed in three patients out of 53 patients with anorectal malformation.  14 consecutive subjects with idiopathic megacolon whose symptoms began after the age of 10 and a clinical history of 2-22 years.  the anorectal malformation associated with down's syndrome uniformly consists of a low-lying rectal pouch without a genitourinary or perineal fistula.  megacolon, chronic dilation of a colonic segment,is accompanied by extensive myenteric neuron loss.  the level of aganglionosis was up to the left colon in two and total colonic with ileal involvement in one.  two had down's syndrome.  subsequent evaluations confirmed total colonic aganglionosis. ||| ",yes
Is airplane stroke syndrome a common disease.,"several reports describe a potential association between prolonged flights and stroke.  the authors report three cases of ischemic stroke in young adults that occurred during or after an airplane flight.  stroke on board aircraft has been reported in retrospective case series, mainly focusing on economy class stroke syndrome.  we here describe the case of a 44-year-old woman who presented with an acute anterior circulation stroke after a transoceanic flight.  we found a low incidence of stroke in the setting of air travel.  economy class stroke syndrome and arterial dissection were well represented in our sample.  the estimated incidence of stroke was 1 stroke in 35 000 flights.  this study is a unique examination of significant outcomes in aviators with previous history of both af and stroke.methods: pilots examined by the faa between 2002 and 2012 who had had af at some point during his or her medical history were reviewed, and those with an initial stroke or transient ischemic attack (tia) during that time period were included in this study.  ""economy class"" stroke syndrome may be underdiagnosed and is an eminently preventable cause of stroke.  the 'headache attributed to airplane travel', also named 'airplane headache' (ah), is a recently described headache disorder that appears exclusively in relation to airplane flights, in particular during the landing phase.  the most common reason for not treating patients who had experienced stroke onset midflight was the delay in reaching the hospital.  this study demonstrated that headache attributed to airplane travel is not as rare as previously thought, being predominant during takeoff or landing.  the headache attributed to airplane travel, also named ""airplane headache"", is characterized by the sudden onset of a severe head pain exclusively in relation to airplane flights, mainly during the landing phase.  a prospective registry was designed to include all consecutive patients referred from an international airport (40 million passengers a year) to our hospital with a diagnosis of ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack and onset of symptoms during a flight or immediately after landing.  headache attributed to airplane travel, also named ""airplane headache"" (ah) is a headache that occurs during take-off and landing.  data on the actual incidence, pathogenesis, and prognosis of stroke in commercial flights are lacking.  airplane travel headache is rare and has recently been described as a new form of headache associated with a specific situation.  we present a young patient with a new type of headache that appeared during flights: take-off and landing of a plane and was not associated with other conditions.  as more cases of headache attributed to airplane travel are reported, epidemiological data can be obtained to further understand the incidence and prevalence of this condition, which can lead to improved treatment options for patients.  airplane headache (ah) occurs during flights and often appears as an intense, short lasting headache during take-off or landing. ||| ",no
Is alemtuzumab effective for remission induction in patients diagnosed with T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia?,"initial treatment with the monoclonal anti-cd52 antibody alemtuzumab induces responses in the majority of patients with t-cell prolymphocytic leukemia (t-pll).  alemtuzumab is the treatment choice for patients with t-prolymphocytic leukemia (t-pll).  infusional alemtuzumab followed by consolidating allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in eligible patients is considered a standard of care in t-cell prolymphocytic leukemia (t-pll).  in this case series, three chemotherapy-naïve t-pll patients received alemtuzumab for remission induction and allogeneic sct after reduced-intensity conditioning.  t-cell prolymphocytic leukemia is a rare aggressive malignancy with low susceptibility to conventional chemotherapy.  our findings demonstrate activity of combination epigenetic and immunotherapy in the incurable illness t-pll, particularly in the setting of previous alemtuzumab therapy.  treatment with alemtuzumab is a reasonable option for patients with progressive and symptomatic cll that is refractory to both alkylator-based and fludarabine-based regimens.  alemtuzumab, an anti-cd52 humanized monoclonal antibody, is the treatment of choice for remission induction.  t-cell prolymphocytic leukemia (t-pll) is a rare and aggressive postthymic t-cell neoplasm with an associated survival time of 1 year when left untreated.  background: t-cell prolymphocytic leukemia (t-pll) is a rare lymphoid malignancy with dismal prognosis.  current standard of care for t-pll is with alemtuzumab, followed by allogeneic or autologous stem cell transplant.  patients receiving alemtuzumab experienced significantly improved progression-free survival as compared with patients undergoing observation.  t-prolymphocytic leukemia (t-pll), a rare aggressive mature t-cell disorder, remains frequently resistant to conventional chemotherapy.  with the applications of chemotherapy regimens and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, the cure rate of t-all has been significantly improved.  use of the monoclonal anti-cd52 antibody alemtuzumab has improved the rate of complete remission and duration of response to more than 50% and between 6 and 12 months, respectively.  t- cell prolymphocytic leukemia (t- pll) is a rare aggressive hematological malignancy.  although the emergence of bone marrow (bm)-resident p190bcr-abl-specific t lymphocytes has been correlated with hematologic and cytogenetic remissions in patients with philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ph+ all) undergoing maintenance tyrosine-kinase inhibitor treatment, little is known about the possibility of culturing these cells ex vivo and using them in t-cell therapy strategies.  t-cell immunotherapies are promising options in relapsed/refractory b-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (all).  six single-arm studies evaluated disease response with administration of alemtuzumab as a single agent in the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory cll post-fludarabine.  t cell prolymphocytic leukemia (t-pll) is a rare, mature t cell neoplasm with distinct features and an aggressive clinical course. ||| ",yes
Is alternative splicing of apoptotic genes playing a role in the response to DNA or mitochondrial damage?,"a number of genes related to apoptosis undergo alternative splicing.  alternative splicing plays an important role in the control of apoptosis.  some apoptosis-regulating genes also undergo alternative splicing, generating splice variants that antagonzie normal transcripts on apoptosis.  it has long been suggested that alternative splicing is involved in regulation of apoptosis by producing mrna isoforms that encode proteins with distinct and even opposite functions in apoptotic pathways.  alternative splicing and dna damage exhibit cross-regulation, with not only dna damage inducing changes in alternative splicing, but alternative splicing itself possibly modulating the dna damage response (ddr).  genome-wide alternative splicing profiling was performed upon dna damage induction and sirt1 deletion.  transcriptional modification by alternative splicing is known to be involved in the regulation of programmed cell death.  here, we explore further this dna damage-dependent alternative splicing.  here, we explore further this dna damage-dependent alternative splicing.  alternative splicing plays important roles in regulating genes critical for cell death.  bcl-x) code for alternatively spliced protein variants with opposing functions, the manipulation of alternative splicing presents a unique way of regulating the apoptotic response.  these studies have provided new evidence supporting the important role of regulated splicing and sr proteins in the process of apoptosis.  studies using molecular, biochemical, and systems-based approaches have begun to reveal mechanisms underlying the regulation of alternative splicing of cell death genes.  differential alternative splicing can affect expression, subcellular distribution, and functional activities of the gene products.  dna damage caused genome-wide changes in alternative splicing in adult nscs and sirt1 deficiency dramatically altered ddr-related alternative splicing.  in this study, we investigated the effect of proapoptotic stimuli on alternative splicing of caspase-2 mrna in u937 cells.  in particular, extensive alternative splicing changes in ddr-related processes such as cell cycle control and dna damage repair were observed; these processes were dramatically influenced by sirt1 deficiency.  alternative splicing of these genes often leads to the formation of functionally different products, some of which have antagonistic effects that are either cell death-promoting or cell death-preventing.  in conclusion, alternative splicing might be involved in functional fine-tuning of trail-induced programmed cell death.  recently, it was demonstrated that inactivation of a single sr protein, asf/sf2, can modulate a specific step in the apoptotic pathway, internucleosomal dna fragmentation, by regulating icad pre-mrna alternative splicing. ||| ",yes
Is amantadine effective for treatment of disorders conciousness?,"recent studies have shown that amantadine, an uncompetitive n-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist and dopamine agonist, is effective for the treatment of various cerebral disorders and causes relatively mild side effects.  indeed, its actions as a pro-dopaminergic drug and as an n-methyl-d-aspartate antagonist makes amantadine an interesting candidate to improve consciousness and responsiveness in individuals with doc, including vegetative state and minimally conscious state.  amantadine is an interesting candidate as new antidepressant drug for the treatment of depression.  the present study aimed to investigate whether amantadine treatment is associated with better clinical outcomes in conservatively treated lhi patients.  amantadine hydrochloride is one of the most commonly used drugs in the pharmacotherapeutic treatment of disorders of consciousness (docs) following traumatic brain injury (tbi).  however, the use of amantadine for the subjective alleviation of fatigue in multiple sclerosis and in the treatment of agitated aggressive behavior in the traumatic brain injured patient has also been described.  an improvement in consciousness was observed within 3-6 days after the start of amantadine administration in all seven cases (n = 7/7; 100%).  in this study, amantadine administration showed substantial positive effects on recovery following severe cerebral hemorrhage.  amantadine appears to show a remarkable antidepressive efficacy in bdv-infected depressive patients.  amantadine is an antiviral agent that is also used in the treatment of parkinsonism and neuroleptic-induced extrapyramidal symptoms.  therefore, the therapeutical use of amantadine in bdv-infected depressive patients was investigated.  amantadine is useful for the prevention and treatment of influenza a and for the treatment of parkinson's disease and drug-induced extrapyramidal disorders.  amantadine treatment yielded a significant decrease in death in-hospital (before psm: or 0.143, 95% ci 0.034 to 0.605; after psm: or 0.113, 95% ci 0.020 to 0.635) and 3-month mortality (before psm: or 0.214, 95% ci 0.077 to 0.598; after psm: or 0.176, 95% ci 0.053 to 0.586) in unmatched and matched multivariate analyses.  amantadine is currently recommended for use in patients of posttraumatic brain injury with unconsciousness.  the aim of this study was to assess effect of amantadine on cognition among individuals with a history of tbi and behavioral disturbance using a parallel-group, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of amantadine 100 mg twice-daily versus placebo for 60 days.  amantadine, which was originally developed as an antiviral medication, functions as a dopamine agonist in the central nervous system and consequently is utilized in the treatment of parkinson disease, drug-induced extrapyramidal reactions, and neuroleptic malignant syndrome.  amantadine is currently recommended for use in patients of post-traumatic brain injury with unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (uws).  originally introduced into pharmacotherapy as an antiviral compound, amantadine was shown to also have multiple pharmacological eftfects on the central nervous system.  the aim of the present studies was to estimate concentrations of amantadine in the central nervous system under therapeutic conditions.  amantadine (1-amino-adamantane) is clinically used for the management of parkinson's disease and drug-induced extrapyramidal symptoms. ||| ",yes

Is arimoclomol a co-inducer of the heat shock response?,"in this review we summarize the evidence for the neuroprotective effects of enhanced heat shock protein expression by arimoclomol and other inducers of the heat shock response.  arimoclomol is a hydroxylamine derivative, a group of compounds which have unique properties as co-inducers of heat shock protein expression, but only under conditions of cellular stress.  it is well established that salicylate and several other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (nsaid), including indomethacin, can activate the heat-shock response, albeit at high concentrations.  arimoclomol is an investigational drug for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (als) that amplifies heat shock protein gene expression during cell stress.  arimoclomol, an amplifier of heat shock protein expression involved in cellular stress response, has emerged as a potential therapeutic candidate in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (als) in recent years.  the novel hydroxylamine derivative, bimoclomol, has been shown previously to act as a co-inducer of several heat shock proteins (hsp-s), enhancing the amount of these proteins produced following a heat shock compared to heat shock alone.  here we show that the co-inducing effect of bimoclomol on hsp expression is mediated via the prolonged activation of the heat shock transcription factor (hsf-1).  bimoclomol has been shown to increase an inducible member of the heat shock protein 70 family (hsp70) and cytoprotect in vitro.  the results demonstrate that indomethacin lowers the temperature-time conbination necessary to induce several physiological processes associated with the heat-shock response.  exposure of mammalian cells in culture to the anti-inflammatory drugs sodium salicylate or indomethacin results in activation of heat shock factor 1 (hsf1) dna binding activity.  bimoclomol, the recently developed non-toxic heat shock protein (hsp) coinducer, was shown to display multilateral protective activities against various forms of stress or injuries at the level of the cell, tissue or organism.  there was a significant correlation (p<0.05) between hsp70 induction and infarct size reduction, whether produced by thermal stress or oral administration of bimoclomol.  arimoclomol csf levels increased with dose.  we have previously shown that the drug-induced hsf1 becomes associated with the heat shock elements of the hsp70 promoter, yet transcription of the hsp70 gene is not induced (jurivich, d. a., sistonen, l., kroes, r. a., and morimoto, r. i.  heat shock response is an adaptive response, which helps the cells to regulate their physiological homeostasis under stress.  although salicylate in combination with a mild heat stress induced heat shock factor activation, only the hearts from severely heat-stressed animals (42 degrees c) demonstrated a significantly elevated myocardial hsp72 content and a significantly enhanced postischemic recovery of left ventricular developed pressure and rates of contraction and relaxation.  carbenoxolone (cbx) is a semisynthetic derivative of the licorice root substance glycyrrhizinic acid and has been previously reported to induce only heat shock protein 70  however, compounds such as arimoclomol have effects beyond targeting protein mis-handling and can also affect additional pathological mechanisms such as oxidative stress.  it was previously shown that heat shock, as well as nsaids, inhibits ir-induced activation of nf-kappab and that nf-kappab protects against ir-induced cytotoxicity.  western blots showed a significant increase in hsp70 6 h after oral administration of bimoclomol and 24 h after thermal stress. ||| ",yes
Is armodafinil used for treatment of insomnia?,"armodafinil is a wakefulness-promoting medication.  armodafinil is typically used in clinical practice to maintain cognition and wakefulness in patients suffering from sleep deprivation.  armodafinil has been shown to improve wakefulness in patients with excessive sleepiness (es) associated with treated obstructive sleep apnoea, shift work disorder or narcolepsy.  armodafinil, a wakefulness-promoting agent, has been studied as adjunctive therapy for the treatment of major depressive episodes associated with bipolar i disorder.  we assessed the ability of armodafinil to improve wakefulness and cognition and reduce fatigue in this population.  armodafinil, the (r)-enantiomer of modafinil, is a medication used to treat the excessive sleepiness associated with narcolepsy, obstructive sleep apnea/hypopnea syndrome, and shift work sleep disorder.  armodafinil is the pharmacologically active r-enantiomer of modafinil, a widely prescribed wake-promoting agent used to treat several sleep-related disorders including excessive daytime sleepiness associated with narcolepsy, shift work sleep disorder, and obstructive sleep apnea/hypopnea syndrome.  once-daily armodafinil was effective in improving wakefulness in adult patients with excessive sleepiness associated with obstructive sleep apnoea/hypopnoea syndrome (osa) , narcolepsy or shift work sleep disorder (swsd) in four large (n > 195), double-blind, multinational trials of 12 weeks' duration.  armodafinil , the r-enantiomer of modafinil, approved for treating excessive sleepiness associated with narcolepsy, obstructive sleep apnea and shift work disorder, is possibly effective as an adjunctive treatment for bipolar depression.  this study evaluated armodafinil 150 mg/day as an adjunct treatment for residual excessive sleepiness in patients with obstructive sleep apnea/hypopnea syndrome (osa/hs) who were otherwise well controlled with nasal continuous positive airway pressure (ncpap).  armodafinil (the r-isomer of racemic modafinil) and modafinil are wakefulness-promoting medications for excessive sleepiness associated with treated obstructive sleep apnea (osa).  the wakefulness-promoting medication armodafinil (r-modafinil) is being studied as an adjunctive treatment for patients with schizophrenia receiving antipsychotic therapy.  once-daily armodafinil was generally well tolerated in adult patients with excessive sleepiness associated with osa (despite treatment of the underlying condition), narcolepsy or swsd.  armodafinil is the r-enantiomer of modafinil, a wake-promoting agent, that primarily affects areas of the brain involved in controlling wakefulness.  adjunct treatment with armodafinil significantly improved alertness, overall clinical condition, and long-term memory.  these data suggest that armodafinil increases wakefulness by mechanisms that extend beyond inhibition of vlpo neurons.  armodafinil significantly improved episodic secondary memory (p=0.0102) and patient-estimated wakefulness (p<0.01) and reduced fatigue (p<0.05) compared with placebo.  armodafinil represents an option for long-term treatment of patients with es associated with treated osa, swd, or narcolepsy.  consequently, the intranasal administration of armodafinil ncsg could serve as a promising integrated-control measure for sleep deprivation.  we assessed the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of armodafinil for hypersomnia associated with dlb. ||| ",no
Is autism one of the characteristics of Moebius syndrome?,"seventeen children and young adults with moebius syndrome were examined with a view to finding symptoms of autism.  the high frequency of autistic symptoms in moebius syndrome might be a marked overrepresentation and could be suggestive of a common underlying neurobiological deficit at the brainstem level.  a strong association of moebius sequence with autism spectrum disorders (asds) has been suggested in earlier studies with heterogenous age groups.  moebius syndrome is a rare congenital neurological disorder.  moebius syndrome is a rare nonprogressive congenital neurological disorder with a wide range of severity and variability of symptoms.  moebius syndrome is a rare congenital disorder characterized mainly by the inability to move the eyes laterally or produce facial expressions such as smiling.  the etiologic hypotheses of moebius syndrome are also discussed.  moebius syndrome, also called congenital facial paralysis is a rare neurological disease, whose etiology is not fully elucidated.  moebius syndrome is a rare disease characterized by congenital facial paralysis and abducens palsy.  moebius syndrome is a rare congenital disorder characterized by congenital facial paralysis and impairment of ocular abduction.  moebius syndrome is a rare cause of congenital facial and abducens palsy.  moebius syndrome is a rare disorder with minimum clinical criteria of congenital facial weakness in association with impairment in abduction of one or both eyes.  moebius syndrome (mbs) is a rare congenital disorder characterized by rhombencephalic mal development, mainly presenting with facial palsy with limited gaze abduction.  this is a review of diagnosis, etiology and abnormalities of moebius syndrome.  moebius syndrome (mbs) is a congenital, non-progressive facial and abducens nerve palsy in the presence of full vertical gaze and may be associated with limb abnormalities and craniofacial dysmorphisms.  it presents a case of a premature newborn baby with moebius syndrome, showing unilateral facial nerve palsy, asymmetry of facial expression, inability to tightly close the right eyelids, asymmetry of the angles of the mouth with frequent drooling, poor sucking ability, dysphagia, extremity abnormalities and other cranial nerve involvement (viii, ix, x, xi).  this case series suggests that moebius syndrome may be associated with mirror movements.  the absence of facial expression in people with moebius syndrome may impair social interaction.  moebius syndrome is one of the rare disorder amongst the oromandibular limb hypogenesis.  we present three patients who meet minimum criteria for a diagnosis of moebius syndrome and who also display mirror movements. ||| ",yes
Is autophagy modulated in a circadian fashion?,"recent work has demonstrated that autophagy is rhythmically activated in a clock-dependent manner.  this review discusses the mechanisms underlying circadian autophagy regulation, the role of rhythmic autophagy in nutrient and energy metabolism, and its implications in physiology and metabolic disease.  autophagy and energy metabolism are known to follow a circadian pattern.  autophagy is a highly conserved intracellular degradation system, and recently was shown to display circadian rhythms in mice.  recently, we reported that autophagy exhibits robust circadian rhythm in mouse liver, accompanied by cyclic induction of genes involved in various steps of autophagy.  because autophagy is a conserved biological process that contributes to nutrient and cellular homeostasis, its cyclic induction may provide a novel link between clock and metabolism.  rhythmic activation of physiological autophagy appears to be regulated by transcription factor c/ebpβ, which is sufficient and required for nutritional and circadian regulation of autophagy gene expression.  our data provide insight into how circadian rhythms serve as a framework for connecting the spatial, temporal, and metabolic aspects of autophagy at a system-wide level.  taken together, these findings provide evidence for how the circadian clock regulates autophagy, imply that nutritional signaling affects both circadian regulation and autophagy activities in peripheral organs, and shed light on how circadian gene mutations act through autophagy to contribute to common metabolic diseases such as obesity.  luciferase reporter and chip assays show that the circadian clock directly regulates autophagy genes through nr1d1, and also regulates transcription of cebpb through per1b.  these data reveal a direct link between nutrient and clock-dependent regulation of gene expression shedding a new light on the crosstalk between autophagy, metabolism, and circadian cycles.  however, it is unclear whether autophagy and the circadian clock are coordinated by common control mechanisms.  these findings provide new insight into transcriptional control of autophagy and reveal a potentially important role of autophagy cycles in metabolic homeostasis.  the mechanisms underlying circadian regulation of autophagy, however, are still unclear.  abnormal autophagy regulation affects the chemoresistance of ovarian cancer, during which the circadian gene clock may play a major role.  genetic ablation of tfeb and tfe3 in mice results in deregulated autophagy over the diurnal cycle and altered gene expression causing abnormal circadian wheel-running behavior.  here, we measured the circadian rhythm of autophagy-related proteins in mouse hippocampus and tested the effect of sleep fragmentation (sf).  circadian rhythms of autophagy have been studied in several peripheral organs but not yet reported in the brain.  tfeb and tfe3 display a circadian activation over the 24-h cycle and are responsible for the rhythmic induction of genes involved in autophagy during the light phase.  our data identified a globally harmonized rhythm for basal macroautophagy, chaperone-mediated autophagy, and proteasomal activity, which concentrates liver proteolysis during the daytime. ||| ",yes
Is autophagy the process where bacteria ingest viral particles?,"autophagy is an intracellular degradation and recycling process that can also remove pathogenic intracellular bacteria and viruses from within cells (referred to as xenophagy) and activate the adaptive immune responses.  autophagy is a protective process against some intracellular bacteria and viruses; however, it is also used for replication by some viruses, such as poliovirus.  previous study showed that avibirnavirus particles could be engulfed into the autophagosome and degradation of virus particles took apart.  autophagy is a process to engulf aberrant organelles or protein aggregates into double-membrane vesicles for lysosomal breakdown.  autophagy, an ancient and highly conserved intracellular degradation process, is viewed as a critical component of innate immunity because of its ability to deliver cytosolic bacteria to the lysosome.  rationale: autophagy is an essential, homeostatic process by which cells break down their own components, it also contributes to restricting bacterial infection in host defense systems; yet, how autophagy regulates viral infection remains inconclusive.  autophagy involves the sequestration of endogenous or foreign components from the cytosol within double-membraned vesicles and the delivery of their content to the lysosomes for degradation.  (1,2) bacteria and viruses targeted for destruction are sequestered into large double-membrane vesicles called autophagosomes and subsequently delivered to the lysosomes where they are consumed by resident hydrolases.  bacteria that escape from membrane-enclosed vacuoles to the cytosol of cells are targeted by autophagy, which recognizes and captures bacteria into autophagosomes wherein their proliferation is restricted.  bacterial autophagy-a type of macroautophagy that is also termed xenophagy-selectively targets intracellular bacteria such as group a streptococcus (gas), a ubiquitous pathogen that causes numerous serious diseases, including pharyngitis, skin infections, and invasive life-threatening infections.  activation of autophagy is part of the innate immune response during viral infections.  in recent years, the process of selective autophagy has received much attention with respect to the clearance of protein aggregates, damaged mitochondria and bacteria.  conversely, pathogens can evolve proteins which modulate the autophagy pathway to subvert degradation and establish an infection.  cellular autophagy, a process that directs cytosolic contents to the endosomal and lysosomal pathways via the formation of double-membraned vesicles, is a crucial aspect of innate immunity to many intracellular pathogens.  unfortunately, conserved cellular pathways are often exploited by pathogens to facilitate their entry or replication, and autophagy is no exception.  during infection, cvb co-opts a cellular pathway, termed autophagy, to provide the membranes necessary for its replication.  autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved process by which cells ingest damaged organelles as a means of maintaining cell homeostasis.  selective autophagy is a highly specific and regulated degradation pathway for the clearance of damaged or unwanted cytosolic components and superfluous organelles as well as invading microbes.  pathogenic bacteria have evolved several mechanisms to escape degradation or exploit autophagy to acquire host nutrients.  many picornaviruses induce autophagy to benefit viral replication, but an understanding of how autophagy occurs remains incomplete. ||| ",yes
Is autosomal dominant inheritanced form of Osteogenesis imperfecta caused by mutations in the genes associated with collagen production?,"classic osteogenesis imperfecta, an autosomal dominant disorder associated with osteoporosis and bone fragility, is caused by mutations in the genes for type i collagen.  osteogenesis imperfecta is inherited as a dominant disease because if one allele is mutated, it contributes a mutant, destructive subunit polypeptide to collagen, which requires many subunits to form normal, polymeric, collagenous structures.  osteogenesis imperfecta is a clinically heterogenous disease caused by defective collagen syntesis associated with a mutation in the col1a1 or col1a2 genes.  in general, osteogenesis imperfecta is caused by heterozygous mutations in either of the genes encoding the alpha 1 or alpha 2 chains of type i collagen (col1a1 and col1a2, respectively).  mutations in type i collagen result in autosomal dominant osteogenesis imperfecta, whereas mutations in either of two components of the collagen prolyl 3-hydroxylation complex (cartilage-associated protein  and prolyl 3-hydroxylase 1 ) cause autosomal recessive osteogenesis imperfecta with rhizomelia (shortening of proximal segments of upper and lower limbs) and delayed collagen folding.  in general, osteogenesis imperfecta (brittle bone disease) is caused by heterozygous mutations in the genes encoding the alpha 1 or alpha 2 chains of type i collagen (col1a1 and col1a2, respectively).  most cases are caused by an autosomal dominant mutation in either col1a1 or col1a2 gene encoding type i collagen.  osteogenesis imperfecta (oi) is the most common heritable bone fragility disorder, usually caused by dominant mutations in genes coding for collagen type i alpha chains, col1a1 or col1a2 osteocalcin (ocn) is now recognized as a bone-derived regulator of insulin secretion and sensitivity and glucose homeostasis.  autosomal dominant oi is caused by mutations in the genes (col1a1 or col1a2) encoding the chains of type i collagen.  osteogenesis imperfecta (oi) is a rare heritable skeletal disorder which is mainly caused by defected type i collagen.  osteogenesis imperfecta (oi) is a heritable connective tissue disorder usually characterized by either a reduction in the production of normal collagen i or the synthesis of abnormal collagen.  osteogenesis imperfecta (oi) is a genetic disorder of connective tissue characterized by bone fragility and alteration in synthesis and posttranslational modification of type i collagen.  osteogenesis imperfecta (oi) is a heritable bone fragility disorder that is usually due to dominant mutations in col1a1 or col1a2.  the aim of this study was to identify mutations and allelic variants of the col1a1 gene in patients with osteogenesis imperfecta (oi).  three of 10 children with lethal or severe osteogenesis imperfecta, who did not have a primary collagen defect yet had excess post-translational modification of collagen, were found to have a recessive condition resulting in crtap deficiency, suggesting that prolyl 3-hydroxylation of type i collagen is important for bone formation.  autosomal dominant forms result from mutations in either the col1a1 (collagen type i alpha-1 chain) or col1a2 (collagen type i alpha-2 chain) genes encoding the type i collagen.  in most cases an impaired collagen production due to mutations in col1a1 or col1a2 cause this hereditary bone fragility syndrome with an autosomal dominant inheritance.  mutations affecting the pro alpha 1(i) or pro alpha 2(i) collagen genes have been identified in each of the major clinical types of osteogenesis imperfecta.  osteogenesis imperfecta is a heritable disorder that causes bone fragility.  osteogenesis imperfecta (oi) is a hereditary bone disease characterized by decreased bone density and multiple fractures, usually inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. ||| ",yes
Is avanafil indicated for treatment of erectile dysfunction?,"previous studies have reported the clinical efficacy of avanafil for erectile dysfunction (ed), but these findings are controversial.  these results permitted us to suggest that daily avanafil can improve the impaired endothelial function associated with the erectile dysfunction.  this study was conducted to assess the effect of daily avanafil on the endothelial markers' serum level and erectile function in patients with erectile dysfunction.  to compare the efficacy and safety between different dosages of avanafil for the treatment of erectile dysfunction (ed).  phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors (pde5-is) sildenafil, vardenafil, tadalafil and the recently approved avanafil represent the first-line choice for both on-demand and chronic treatment of erectile dysfunction (ed).  this study aims to investigate the safety and efficacy of avanafil for ed.  the efficacy and tolerability of vardenafil hydrochloride in men with erectile dysfunction (ed) and a history of nonresponse to sildenafil citrate have previously been reported.  sildenafil (viagra) is the first oral medication approved for the treatment of erectile dysfunction.  vardenafil was developed specifically to be an effective and safe oral medication for the treatment of erectile dysfunction, with potential advances over existing therapies.  it has proven to be an effective option in the treatment of erectile dysfunction of different etiologies.  at the end of treatment period, those randomised to avanafil achieved statistically significant improvement in erectile function, nitric oxide, cyclic guanosine monophosphate and endothelin-1 levels from baseline versus placebo regardless the type and duration of associated comorbidity as well as the duration and severity of erectile dysfunction.  to assess the ability of vardenafil to restore normal erectile function in men with general ed.  avanafil, from 50 to 200 mg, is effective and well tolerated for the treatment of ed, and an increase in dosage is associated with a significant rise in effectiveness but not with significantly more adverse events.  in this work, we randomly divided 140 males with erectile dysfunction and other diseases commonly associated with endothelial dysfunction like diabetes mellitus, hypertension and dyslipidaemia into two equal groups: treatment group, treated with 50mg daily oral avanafil, and control group, treated with placebo.  vardenafil is used in treatment of erectile dysfunction (ed) but reveals variable clinical outcomes.  while avanafil does not have any patient satisfaction trials to date, it has been proven to be a safe and effective treatment for ed with possibly the fastest onset of action and fewer visual disturbances than its competitors.  vardenafil is a selective phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor approved for the treatment of erectile dysfunction.  avanafil along with the other pde5is has shown to be a safe and effective oral treatment for ed, with avanafil's possible place in therapy for patients who want an on-demand option or as an alternative in patients who experience visual disturbances with the other agents.  vardenafil is a potent and highly selective oral phosphodiesterase type 5 (pde-5) inhibitor that has been shown in numerous clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance studies to be safe and effective for improving erectile function in men with erectile dysfunction (ed).  vardenafil is a selective phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor used for erectile dysfunction treatment. ||| ",yes
Is bapineuzumab effective for treatment of patients with Alzheimer's disease?,"bapineuzumab appears capable of reducing the cerebral beta-amyloid peptide burden in patients with alzheimer's disease.  bapineuzumab, an anti-β-amyloid monoclonal antibody, was evaluated in patients with mild to moderate alzheimer disease.  the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (pks) of bapineuzumab (aab-001), a humanized monoclonal antibody to amyloid beta, were evaluated in patients with mild-to-moderate alzheimer disease in a phase 1, randomized, third-party unblinded, placebo-controlled, single ascending dose trial.  bapineuzumab, a humanized anti-amyloid-beta (abeta) monoclonal antibody for the potential treatment of alzheimer disease (ad), was evaluated in a multiple ascending dose, safety, and efficacy study in mild to moderate ad.  bapineuzumab, a humanized anti-amyloid-beta monoclonal antibody, is in clinical development for the treatment of alzheimer's disease.  we performed this systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the safety and efficacy of bapineuzumab in patients with mild to moderate alzheimer's disease.  bapineuzumab, an anti-amyloid monoclonal antibody, was evaluated as a candidate for immunotherapy in mild-to-moderate alzheimer's disease (ad) patients.  bapineuzumab, an anti-amyloid-β monoclonal antibody, was evaluated in two placebo-controlled trials in apoe*ɛ4 carriers and noncarriers, respectively, with alzheimer's disease.  bapineuzumab did not improve clinical outcomes in patients with alzheimer's disease, despite treatment differences in biomarkers observed in apoe ε4 carriers.  bapineuzumab is a humanized anti-amyloid-beta (aβ) monoclonal antibody directed at lowering the cerebral aβ deposit in alzheimer's disease (ad).  bapineuzumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody, targets amyloid-β (aβ1-40/1 -42) that is believed to play a key role in the pathogenesis of alzheimer disease (ad).  bapineuzumab demonstrated target engagement with brain aβ, consistent with published clinical data.  bapineuzumab treatment induced exposure-dependent reductions in brain amyloid burden.  bapineuzumab is a fully humanized monoclonal antibody that binds to neurotoxic amyloid proteins in the brain, enhancing their clearance.  bapineuzumab sc once-monthly did not demonstrate significant treatment difference over placebo on cerebral amyloid signal at one year but was well-tolerated.  clinical studies using the n-terminal-directed anti-aβ antibody bapineuzumab have demonstrated reduced brain pet-pittsburg-b signals, suggesting the reduction of aβ plaques, and reduced levels of total and phosphorylated tau protein in the csf of treated ad patients.  however, the preliminary cognitive efficacy of bapineuzumab, a humanized anti-aβ monoclonal antibody, appears uncertain.  at week 71, bapineuzumab-treated participants with aria-e vs non-aria-e showed greater reduction in brain amyloid pet, greater reductions in csf phosphorylated tau (p-tau) (all comparisons p < 0.01), and total tau (t-tau) (all comparisons p < 0.025), and greater hippocampal volume reduction and ventricular enlargement (all p < 0.05).  this phase 2, open-label extension (ole) study evaluated long-term safety and efficacy of bapineuzumab in patients with the mild-to-moderate ad.  gantenerumab appears capable of reducing the cerebral β-amyloid peptide burden in patients with alzheimer's disease. ||| ",no
Is butterfly rash a symptom of Systemic lupus erythematosus?,"systemic lupus erythematosus may produce a transient rash before any other signs.  sle was diagnosed on the basis of a butterfly rash, photosensitivity, nondeforming arthritis, pleuropericarditis, and alopecia.  the butterfly rash and malar flush are common facial manifestations of several disorders.  over a 42-month period, we encountered skin biopsy specimens from 23 anti-ro-positive patients who did not have scle: 15 had sle variably manifesting as scle-like rashes; malar erythema; a dermatomyositis-like rash; vascular disease involving cutaneous, cardiac, peripheral, and central nervous systems; restrictive pulmonary disease; periorbital edema; and myositis.  lupus vulgaris and lupus pernio produce nodules that may spread in a butterfly pattern, and seborrheic dermatitis has a predilection for the malar prominences and other areas of the face.  several conditions have clinical and laboratory features that can mimic those present in systemic lupus erythematosus (sle).  lupus erythematosus manifests as cutaneous variants, such as discoid lupus erythematosus or systemic lupus erythematosus.  some of these ""sle mimickers"" are very common, such as rosacea which can be mistaken for the butterfly rash, while others such as kikuchi disease, type-1 interferonopathies, castleman's disease, prolidase deficiency, angioimmunoblastic t-cell lymphoma, evans' syndrome in the context of primary immune deficiencies and the autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome are exceptionally uncommon.  cutaneous lupus erythematosus (cle) includes skin symptoms seen in sle and cutaneous-limited le.  lupus erythematosus (le) includes a broad spectrum of diseases from a cutaneous-limited type to a systemic type.  systemic lupus erythematosus is a multisystem autoimmune disease characterized by general autoantibody production and a wide range of mucocutaneous, renal, neuropsychiatric, cardiovascular, infectious, and hematologic manifestations.  the clinical manifestations of this disease include an erythematous rash, oral ulcers, polyarthralgia, nonerosive arthritis, polyserositis, hematologic, renal, neurologic, pulmonary and cardiac abnormalties.  bullous systemic lupus erythematosus (bsle) is a rare autoimmune subepidermal blistering disease with a female predominance characterized as an acute vesicobullous eruption in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (sle).  previous studies have demonstrated that ro/ssa antigen antibody might be involved in the pathogenesis of lupus erythematosus.  bullous systemic lupus erythematosus (bsle) is a rare cutaneous autoimmune disorder characterized by rapid, widespread vesiculobullous lesions in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (sle).  skin is one of the main target organs in lupus erythematosus and in some circumstances, skin lesions precede systemic manifestations.  two patients had primary sjögren syndrome, one had primary antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, and two had rheumatoid arthritis; all five had clinical evidence of cutaneous vasculopathy encompassing livedo, perniosis, and palpable purpura.  subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus (scle) is characterized by particular cutaneous manifestations such as non-scaring plaques mainly in sunlight exposed parts of the body along with specific serum autoantibodies (i.e.  systemic lupus erythematosus (sle) is a rare complex autoimmune disease with a multisystem involvement.  skin manifestations are frequent and sometimes vesiculobullous lesions may apper such as in bullous lupus erythematosus. ||| ",yes
Is c-met involved in the activation of the Akt pathway?,"c-met involves in the activation of several signaling pathways, most of them are implicated in aggressive cancer phenotypes.  c-met is a receptor tyrosine kinase frequently overexpressed or amplified in many types of human cancers.  c-met is a receptor-type tyrosine kinase, which is involved in a wide range of cellular responses such as proliferation, motility, migration and invasion.  c-met is a tyrosine receptor kinase which is activated by its ligand, the hepatocyte growth factor.  c-met is abnormally activated in many tumour types.  at the molecular level, bms-777607 suppressed autophosphorylated c-met and downstream c-src and akt pathways.  in this review, we briefly summarize signaling pathways of c-met, and discuss the crystal structures of representative c-met and the binding modes with their ligands.  the receptor tyrosine kinase c-met is implicated in oncogenesis and is the target for several small molecule and biologic agents in clinical trials for the treatment of cancer.  c-met is a receptor tyrosine kinase that upon binding of its ligand, hepatocyte growth factor (hgf), activates downstream pathways with diverse cellular functions that are important in organ development and cancer progression.  activation of c-met leads to a wide spectrum of biological activities such as motility, angiogenesis, morphogenesis, cell survival and cell regeneration.  anomalous c-met signalling has been described in a variety of cancer types, and the receptor is regarded as a novel therapeutic target.  kinase activation could be due to over-expression of the normal c-met protein or to the presence of activating mutation(s).  here we describe the structural basis of c-met activation upon autophosphorylation and the selective small molecule inhibiton of autophosphorylated c-met.  aberrant c-met activation was found to induce tumour development, tumour cell migration and invasion, and the worst and final step in cancer progression, metastasis.  binding of the hepatocyte growth factor to the cell surface receptor of c-met induces activation via autophosphorylation of the kinase domain.  the c-met receptor tyrosine kinase is aberrantly activated in many solid tumors.  the same results support the hypothesis that akt is a direct target of the pi3-k and identify cytoplasmic signaling molecules that may contribute to the transduction of pi3-k/akt activation signals.  over the last two decades, much has been learnt about the functional role of c-met signalling in different models of breast development and cancer.  recent studies have demonstrated a role for the c-jun n-terminal kinase (jnk) in met-induced transformation, but little is known about the molecular mechanisms that connect met to jnk activation.  akt1, also known as protein kinase b (pkb) alpha, is frequently activated in human cancers and has been implicated in many cell processes by phosphorylation of downstream molecules. ||| ",yes
Is c-myc subject to regulation by the circadian clock?,"the expression of cell cycle genes such as wee1, cyclins, and c-myc are under circadian control and could be directly under the regulation of the circadian transcriptional complex.  the circadian clock regulates daily variations in physiologic processes.  clock-interacting protein, circadian (cipc), has been indicated as an additional negative-feedback regulator of the circadian clock in vitro, although its physiological roles in circadian clock are unknown.  post-translational regulation of clk/cyc has previously been shown to be crucial for clock function and accurate timing of circadian transcription.  the circadian clock plays a critical role in physiology and medicine by cyclically regulating the expression of numerous genes.  our observations showed that hulc was able to heighten the expression levels of clock and its downstream circadian oscillators, such as period circadian clock 1 and cryptochrome circadian clock 1, in hepatoma cells.  the circadian transcription factor clock exhibits a circadian oscillation in its phosphorylation levels.  the circadian clock co-ordinates physiology and behavior with the day/night cycle.  however, the underlying mechanism of circadian clock disruption in hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc) remains unclear.  importantly, we found that the circadian transcriptional repressors cryptochrome (cry) and period (per) showed an opposite effect on clock phosphorylation; cry impaired bmal1-dependent clock phosphorylation, whereas per protected the phosphorylation against cry.  circadian genes control most of the physiological functions including cell cycle.  the circadian clock regulates biological processes from gene expression to organism behavior in a precise, sustained rhythm that is generated at the unicellular level by coordinated function of interlocked transcriptional feedback loops and post-translational modifications of core clock proteins.  the daily organisation of most mammalian cellular functions is attributed to circadian regulation of clock-controlled protein expression, driven by daily cycles of cryptochrome-dependent transcriptional feedback repression.  the molecular machinery that governs circadian rhythmicity comprises proteins whose interplay generates time-specific transcription of clock genes.  the circadian clock facilitates a temporal coordination of most homeostatic activities and their synchronization with the environmental cycles of day and night.  this phosphorylation controls the nuclear-cytosolic translocation of clock and thus its ability to regulate circadian gene expression in peripheral tissues.  the circadian rhythm regulates numerous physiological activities, including sleep and wakefulness, behavior, immunity and metabolism.  in addition, clock directly bound to the promoter of il-23r in γ/δ+ t cells, and il-23r expression in the mouse skin was under circadian control.  circadian genes continue to gain attention as important transcriptional regulators with the potential to influence a variety of biological pathways, including many cancer-related processes.  circadian rhythm is a biological rhythm governing physiology and behavior with a period of ∼24 h. at the molecular level, circadian output is controlled by a molecular clock composed of positive and negative feedback loops in transcriptional and post-translational processes. ||| ",yes
Is cadasil syndrome a hereditary disease?,"therefore, it has been suggested that cdls can be considered a transcriptomopathy.  cornelia de lange syndrome (cdls) is a rare congenital genetic disease causing abnormal unique facial phenotypes, several defects in organs and body parts, and mental disorder or intellectual disorder traits.  cornelia de lange syndrome (cdls) is a human developmental syndrome with complex multisystem phenotypic features.  cornelia de lange syndrome (cdls) is a multiple congenital anomaly disorder resulting from mutations in genes that encode the core components of the cohesin complex, smc1a, smc3, and rad21, or two of its regulatory proteins, nipbl and hdac8.  patients with cdls have a high incidence of chd, which varies according to the affected gene, the most frequent findings being septal defects and pulmonary stenosis.  cornelia de lange syndrome (cdls) and associated spectrum disorders are characterized by one or more congenital anomalies including distinctive facial features, upper limb abnormalities, intellectual disability, and other symptoms.  cornelia de lange syndrome (cdls) is the founding member of a class of multi-organ system birth defect syndromes termed cohesinopathies, named for the chromatin-associated protein complex cohesin, which mediates sister chromatid cohesion.  cornelia de lange syndrome (cdls) spectrum disorders are characterized by multiple organ system congenital anomalies that result from mutations in genes encoding core cohesin proteins smc1a, smc3, and rad21, or proteins that regulate cohesin function such as nipbl and hdac8.  here, we present a family of afro-caribbean ancestry with cdls presenting with phenotypic variability, including unusual lower limb abnormalities.  cornelia de lange syndrome (cdls) is produced by mutations in genes that encode regulatory or structural proteins of the cohesin complex.  actually, cdls-like phenotypes have been associated to mutations in chromatin-associated proteins, as kmt2a, aff4, ep300, taf6, setd5, smarcb1, mau2, zmynd11, med13l, phip, arid1b, naa10, brd4 or ankrd11, most of which have no known direct association with cohesin.  cardiological findings were evaluated in 149 patients with cdls and their possible relationship with clinical and genetic variables.  in this review, we intend to integrate the recent available evidence on the molecular mechanisms underlying the clinical manifestations of cdls, highlighting data that favors a transcription-centered framework, which support the idea that cdls could be conceptualized as a transcriptomopathy.  our results lead a definitive diagnosis of patients with cdls and expand the spectrum of mutations in the nipbl gene.  mutations in the hlxb9 gene have been suggested to be the genetic background of cs.  the observation of this novel family adds to our knowledge of the phenotypic and molecular aspects of cdls.  cornelia de lange syndrome (cdls) comprises a recognizable pattern of multiple congenital anomalies caused by variants of the dna cohesion complex.  if abnormal it is just another clinical manifestation of the syndrome.  genetic analysis was performed in 3 affected members and 1 unaffected member of a pedigree with cdcd including the affected 31-year-old proband.  mutations in cohesin genes have been identified in cornelia de lange syndrome (cdls), but its etiopathogenetic mechanisms are still poorly understood. ||| ",yes
Is calcium overload involved in the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy?,"it has been suggested that intracellular ca2+ overload in cardiac myocytes leads to the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy.  it has been suggested that the occurrence of an intracellular ca2+ overload may result in the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy, which is associated with depletion of high-energy phosphate stores and a derangement of ultrastructure and cardiac dysfunction.  decreased contractility of diabetic myocardium is associated with intracellular calcium overload.  the diabetic heart has an abnormal intracellular calcium (i) metabolism.  cardiac dysfunction in diabetic cardiomyopathy may be associated with abnormal ca2+ homeostasis.  this study investigated the effects of alterations in ca2+ homeostasis and sarcoplasmic reticulum ca2+-associated proteins on cardiac function in the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy.  it is now becoming clear that cardiac dysfunction in chronic diabetes is intimately involved with ca(2+)-handling abnormalities, metabolic defects and impaired sensitivity of myofibrils to ca(2+) in cardiomyocytes.  these results suggest that casr activation could lead to the apoptosis of cardiomyocytes in diabetic cardiac injury through the induction of calcium overload, the activation of the mitochondrial, and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway.  hyperglycaemia is a major aetiological factor in the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy.  ca(2+)-handling abnormalities in the diabetic heart occur mainly due to defects in sarcolemmal na(+)-k(+) atpase, na(+)-ca(2+) exchange, na(+)-h(+) exchange, ca(2+)-channels and ca(2+)-pump activities as well as changes in sarcoplasmic reticular ca(2+)-uptake and ca(2+)-release processes; these alterations may lead to the occurrence of intracellular ca(2+) overload.  we have found aberrant diastolic ca2+ concentrations (d), decreased glucose transport, elevated production of reactive oxygen species (ros), and increased calpain activity in cardiomyocytes from a murine model (db/db) of type 2 diabetes (t2d).  studies in cardiomyocytes have shown that diabetes results in impaired (i) homeostasis due to altered sarcoplasmic reticulum ca(2+) atpase (serca) and sodium-calcium exchanger (ncx) activity.  type 2 diabetic cardiomyopathy features ca2+ signaling abnormalities, notably an altered mitochondrial ca2+ handling.  echocardiography and hemodynamic measurements revealed that cardiac dysfunction is associated with the progression of diabetes, which also correlated with a gradual but significant decline in ca2+ spark frequency (in the 4-, 8- and 12-week diabetic groups).  changes in calcium handling, disruption of the extracellular matrix regulation with accumulation of cardiac collagen, and furthermore cardiac inflammation may be an important mediator of this disease.  these results improve our understanding of how diabetes affects calcium regulation in cecs, and may contribute to the development of new therapies for dcm treatment.  therefore, our study demonstrates that the reticulum-mitochondria ca2+ miscoupling may play an early and reversible role in the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy by disrupting primarily the mitochondrial bioenergetics.  ca2+ sparks exhibited a time-dependent decay with progression of diabetic cardiomyopathy, which may partly contribute to cardiac dysfunction.  importantly, altered calcium homeostasis may also be involved in diabetes-associated endothelial dysfunction, including impaired endothelium-dependent relaxation and a diminished capacity to generate nitric oxide (no), elevated cell adhesion molecules, and decreased angiogenic growth factors.  clinical and experimental observation has showed the development of dysfunctional cardiomyopathy as one of the main complications of diabetes. ||| ",yes
Is cardiac magnetic resonance imaging indicated in the pre-participation screening of athletes?,"in view of this, pre-participation cardiac screening is mandatory across many sporting disciplines to identify those athletes at risk.  advanced cardiac imaging, using cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (mri) and multidetector computed tomography (ct), is increasingly used in the work-up of athletes with suspected abnormalities on screening.  cardiovascular magnetic resonance (cmr) is frequently used in the investigation of suspected cardiac disease in athletes.  adding ecg to medical history and physical examination improves the overall sensitivity of preparticipation cardiovascular screening in athletes.  although cardiovascular screening is recommended for athletes before participating in sports, the role of 12-lead electrocardiography (ecg) remains uncertain.  professional athletes or participants in a competitive athletic program underwent a screening that included family and personal medical history, physical examination, electrocardiography, exercise testing, and doppler echocardiography.  when added to the medical history and physical examination, an ecg used during the pre-participation screening (pps) of young athletes can greatly enhance the ability to detect underlying cardiovascular pathology.  echocardiography is frequently used as a first-line screening tool of athletes.  background previous studies revealed a relatively high prevalence of electrocardiographic findings indicative for myocardial ischemia in asymptomatic athletes undergoing pre-participation screening.  systematic pre-participation screening of subjects practicing sports activity has the potential to identify athletes at risk of sudden cardiac death.  the aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of cardiac structural changes via the systematic use of echocardiography in preparticipation screening of competitive athletes.  for patients less than 35 years of age, cardiac mri is the first option after initial echocardiography for further assessment of cardiomyopathies, myocarditis and coronary anomalies, which are major causes of sudden cardiac death in young athletes.  although imaging is not advocated as a first-line screening tool, there is a growing interest in the use of echocardiography in ppe of athletes.  these findings suggest the use of echocardiography in at least the first preparticipation screening of competitive athletes to improve the effectiveness of programs aimed at preventing sudden death in athletes.  the application of echocardiography in preparticipation screening might be essential: it shows high sensitivity and specificity for identification of structural cardiac disease and it is the first-line imagining technique for primary prevention of scd in athletes.  however, limited evidence are present concerning the yield of echocardiography as a second-line exam in athletes with abnormal pre-participation screening.  although cardiovascular screening is recommended before participating in competitive sports, the role of the 12-lead electrocardiogram (ecg) has been debated.  in this review, we discuss how cmr can be used in athletes with suspected cardiomyopathy with particular reference to volumetric analysis and tissue characterization.  screening of competitive athletes and other individuals exposed to regular and intense physical exercise, such as military personnel, can lead to an early and preclinical identification of cardiac conditions associated with a higher risk for sudden cardiac death.  objectives the main purpose of this study was to investigate the positive predictive value of myocardial perfusion scintigraphy for detection of coronary artery disease in asymptomatic athletes with abnormal exercise testing results during pre-participation screening. ||| ",no
Is celiac disease caused by gliadin-induced transglutaminase-2 (TG2)-dependent events ?,"the enzyme transglutaminase 2 (tg2) plays a crucial role in the initiation of celiac disease by catalyzing the deamidation of gluten peptides.  type 2 transglutaminase (tg2) has an important pathogenic role in celiac disease (cd), an inflammatory intestinal disease that is caused by the ingestion of gluten-containing cereals.  a number of lines of evidence suggest that transglutaminase 2 (tg2) may be one of the earliest disease-relevant proteins to encounter immunotoxic gluten in the celiac gut.  type 2-transglutaminase (tg2) activity seems to be responsible for a strong autoimmune response in celiac disease, tg2 being the main autoantigen.  celiac disease (ced) is a t-cell-dependent enteropathy with autoimmune features where tissue transglutaminase (tg2)-mediated posttranslational modification of gliadin peptides has a decisive role in the pathomechanism.  autoantibodies specific for the enzyme transglutaminase 2 (tg2) are a hallmark of the gluten-sensitive enteropathy celiac disease.  the multifunctional, protein cross-linking transglutaminase 2 (tg2) is the main autoantigen in celiac disease, an autoimmune disorder with defined etiology.  in celiac disease, gluten ingestion provokes small-bowel mucosal injury and production of iga autoantibodies against transglutaminase 2 (tg2).  in celiac disease, small intestinal transglutaminase 2 causes deamidation of glutamine residues in gluten peptides, which enhances stimulation of t cells and leads to mucosal injury.  transglutaminase (tg)2 is the autoantigen in celiac disease, but also tg3 antibodies have been detected in the serum of celiac disease patients.  a prominent example is the involvement of transglutaminase 2 (tg2) in the gluten-sensitive enteropathy celiac disease, where the enzyme is both the target of autoantibodies and responsible for the generation of immunogenic gluten epitopes.  the chronic, small intestinal inflammation that defines celiac disease is initiated by a hla-dq2 restricted t-cell response to ingested gluten peptides after their in vivo deamidation by tissue transglutaminase (tg2).  our findings are in line with the concept that a ""celiac cellular phenotype"" exists and that tg2 may contribute to this phenotype.  several studies support the concept that celiac anti-tg2 antibodies may contribute to disease pathogenesis.  these and other investigations also suggest that the reaction catalyzed by tg2 on dietary gluten peptides is essential for the pathogenesis of celiac disease.  the present report focuses on the diagnosis of celiac disease and its pathogenesis, which depends on a genetic predisposition (hla dq2 or dq8 haplotypes), gluten ingestion and t cell activation, type ii transglutaminase (tg2), the autoantigen recognized by the antiendomysial antibody playing a key role.  inhibition of transglutaminase 2 is a potential treatment for celiac disease.  transglutaminase 2 (tissue transglutaminase, tgase 2) was recently identified as an endomysial autoantigen in celiac disease (cd).  deamidation of distinct glutamines in hla-dq2 restricted gliadin epitopes, considered critical in the pathogenesis of coeliac disease (cd), can be mediated by tissue transglutaminase (ttg).  by means of its catalytic activity, tg2 seems to have an important pathogenetic role in celiac disease (cd), an inflammatory intestinal disease caused by the ingestion of gluten-containing cereals. ||| ",yes
Is cilengitide effective for treatment of glioblastoma?,"the children's oncology group acns0621 study thus evaluated whether cilengitide is active as a single agent in the treatment of children with refractory high-grade glioma (hgg).  cilengitide was well tolerated when combined with standard chemoradiation and may improve survival for patients newly diagnosed with glioblastoma multiforme regardless of mgmt methylation status.  cilengitide, an αv integrin antagonist, has demonstrated activity in recurrent adult glioblastoma (gbm).  cilengitide is a selective integrin inhibitor that is well tolerated and has demonstrated biologic activity in patients with recurrent malignant glioma.  cilengitide is a cyclic peptide antagonist of integrins alphavbeta3 and alphavbeta5 that is currently being evaluated as a novel therapeutic agent for recurrent and newly diagnosed glioblastoma.  the primary objectives of this randomized phase 2 trial were to determine the safety and efficacy of cilengitide when combined with radiation and temozolomide for patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme and to select a dose for comparative clinical testing.  the integrin antagonist cilengitide has been explored as an adjunct with anti-angiogenic properties to standard of care temozolomide chemoradiotherapy (tmz/rt → tmz) in newly diagnosed glioblastoma.  in this study we found that, at clinically relevant concentrations, cilengitide (1-100 microm) induces detachment in some but not all glioma cell lines, while the effect on cell viability is modest.  in this study, we investigated the anti-glioma effect of cilengitide using dna microarray analysis.  we investigated whether cilengitide could amplify the antitumor effects of radiotherapy in an orthotopic rat glioma xenograft model.  no consistent effects of cilengitide on glioma cell migration or invasiveness were observed in vitro.  cilengitide (emd121974) is a cyclized pentapeptide that is a potent and selective integrin antagonist which has shown activity in malignant gliomas.  we aimed to assess cilengitide combined with temozolomide chemoradiotherapy in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma with methylated mgmt promoter.  cilengitide (emd121974), an inhibitor of the adhesive function of integrins, demonstrated preclinical efficacy against malignant glioma.  gene expression profiling revealed more detailed mechanism of the anti-glioma effect of cilengitide.  these data suggest that the beneficial clinical effects derived from cilengitide in vivo may arise from altered perfusion, which promotes temozolomide delivery to glioma cells.  it is speculated that cilengitide can inhibit tumor growth, invasion, and angiogenesis.  this analysis does not support concerns that integrin antagonism by cilengitide may induce a more aggressive phenotype at progression, but also provides no evidence for an anti-invasive activity of cilengitide in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma.  cilengitide (clg) is an inhibitor of both αv β3 and αv β5 integrins, with a defined anti-tumour effect in glioblastoma.  cilengitide (cgt) is a cyclic pentapeptide that demonstrated efficacy for gbm treatment by targeting the integrins avβ3 and avβ5 over-expressed on gbm cells. ||| ",no
Is clathrin involved in E-cadherin endocytosis?,"clathrin-mediated endocytosis (cme), in particular, involves the cytoplasmic protein clathrin which induces formation and internalization of clathrin-coated membrane buds that contain extra-cellular cargo.  e-cadherin is a central component of the adherens junction in epithelial cells and continuously undergoes endocytosis via clathrin-coated vesicles and/or caveolae depending on the cell type.  we examined the selective regulation of clathrin-dependent egfr signaling and endocytosis.  the existence of clathrin-coated buds on endosomes suggests that clathrin might mediate later endocytic trafficking events.  clathrin-mediated endocytosis (cme) occurs via the formation of clathrin-coated vesicles from clathrin-coated pits (ccps).  clathrin-mediated endocytosis is a major regulator of cell-surface protein internalization.  during clathrin-mediated endocytosis (cme), plasma membrane regions are internalized to retrieve extracellular molecules and cell surface components.  hsc70 is known to be involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis (cme) by which cells take up various extracellular materials.  thus, in mdck cells, e-cadherin appeared to be endocytosed solely through smap1-regulated clathrin-coated vesicles.  the clathrin pathway is the principal route for receptor-mediated endocytosis and growth factor downregulation.  in mammalian cells, clathrin plays a crucial role in this process as a scaffolding protein underlying the invaginating plasma membrane and surrounding the primary endocytic vesicle.  clathrin-coated vesicles execute receptor-mediated endocytosis at the plasma membrane.  in the central nervous system, clathrin-mediated endocytosis is crucial for efficient synaptic transmission.  clathrin plays important roles in intracellular membrane traffic including endocytosis of plasma membrane proteins and receptors and protein sorting between the trans-golgi network (tgn) and endosomes.  for endocytosis, the main adaptor is the adaptor protein (ap)-2 complex, but it is uncertain how clathrin contacts ap-2.  in this study, we examined the role of smap1, a clathrin-interacting gtpase-activating protein (gap) for the adp-ribosylation factor 6 (arf6) gtpase, in e-cadherin endocytosis.  collectively, smap1 likely represents a key arf6gap in clathrin dependent endocytosis of e-cadherin in mdck cells.  formation of the endophilin ii-ca(2+) channel complex is ca(2+)-dependent in clathrin-mediated endocytosis.  collectively, these data indicate a role for calcyon in clathrin-mediated endocytosis in brain.  clathrin-coated vesicles mediate a variety of endocytosis pathways in cells, including endocytic events at synapses. ||| ",yes
Is cocaine use associated with increased risk for intracerebral hemorrhage?,"these findings implicate cocaine use as a significant risk factor for fatal brain hemorrhage and may explain, in part, the increased incidence of hemorrhagic stroke in some drug-using cohorts.  cocaine is a cause of intracerebral hemorrhage (ich), but there are no large studies that have characterized the location, pathology, and outcome of patients with cocaine-associated ich.  recent cocaine ingestion is associated with hemorrhages that occur more frequently in subcortical locations, have a higher risk of intraventricular hemorrhage, and have a poor prognosis compared to patients with cocaine-negative, spontaneous ich.  cocaine abuse has been reported to be associated with an increased frequency of hemorrhagic or ischemic stroke.  to determine the incidence of cocaine abuse in cases of fatal intracranial hemorrhage and to examine potential pathophysiologic mechanisms.  cocaine use has been temporally associated with neurovascular complications, including the rupture of intracerebral aneurysms.  intracerebral hemorrhage (ich) is a well-recognized complication of recreational cocaine use.  these results may be relevant to an increased frequency of cerebrovascular accidents in cocaine-abusing individuals.  whereas we found no evidence that chronic cocaine use is a risk factor for caa, given the age-associated nature of caa and the aging population using cocaine, caa-induced hemorrhage in the setting of cocaine use may be more common than recognized.  nine cases of intracranial hemorrhages related to cocaine usage are presented.  the relationship between severe cocaine-induced hypertension, and the development of subarachnoid or intracerebral hemorrhages is noted, and apparently is related to sudden transient increases of blood pressure related to cocaine use.  it is now believed cocaine use may lead to subarachnoid hemorrhage.  cocaine is a known vasoactive drug associated with poor clinical outcomes and high in-hospital mortality related to aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage; however, the association of prior cocaine use with the incidence of vasospasm and delayed cerebral ischemia remains controversial.  intracerebral hemorrhage has been reported as a cocaine-related complication, but has not previously been associated with pregnancy.  we report a case of cocaine-associated intracerebral hemorrhage in the postpartum period which complicated the differential diagnosis and management of hypertension and seizures.  cocaine use is associated with a variety of serious neurological complications, including cerebral infarction, intracerebral and subarachnoid hemorrhage, transient ischemic attacks, migraines, and seizures.  cocaine is a widespread recreational drug that has the potential to induce neurological vascular diseases, including ischaemic and haemorrhagic stroke.  although cocaine abuse has been associated with an increased incidence of cerebrovascular accident, the underlying mechanisms are unknown.  the purpose of the current study was to determine the type of neurovascular complications associated with cocaine use in our patient population, the temporal relationship between cocaine use and their onset, and whether cocaine users with subarachnoid hemorrhage (sah) presented with smaller aneurysms at an earlier age than a control group of noncocaine users with sah.  we review the current literature on the association of cocaine use with the incidence of vasospasm and delayed cerebral ischemia as well as the effects of cocaine on the cerebrovasculature. ||| ",yes
Is corpus callosum involved in the Mowat–Wilson syndrome?,"developmental malformations of the corpus callosum (ccd) can lead to learning and intellectual disabilities.  the corpus callosum has been implicated in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.  alterations in midsagittal corpus callosum (cc) area and morphology have been suggested in several disease processes of the nervous system.  corpus callosum (cc) abnormalities are frequently reported in patients with refractory mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (rmtle).  nine patients had corpus callosum abnormalities, 4 of 9 patients had abnormal signal in the genu and splenium, 5 of 9 patients had abnormal signal only in the splenium.  corpus callosum shape deformation, therefore, may reflect a midline neurodevelopmental abnormality.  background: the regional distribution of the widespread cerebral morphological alterations in progressive supranuclear palsy (psp) is considered to include segmental parts of the corpus callosum (cc).  wilson's disease (wd) with neurological presentation is associated with brain lesions classically localised in globus pallidus, putamen, thalamus, mesencephalon, pons and dentate nucleus.  the corpus callosum (cc) plays a pivotal role in inter-hemispheric transfer and integration of information and is a relatively understudied structure in bipolar disorder (bd).  the corpus callosum, the largest white matter tract in the brain, is a midline structure associated with the formation of the hippocampus, septum pellucidum, and cingulate cortex, which have been implicated in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia.  a correlation between width and angle of the corpus callosum was found in patients with affective disorder.  we examined the corpus callosum and its subregion volumes and their relationship to cognition, psychotic symptoms, and age in probands with schizophrenia (sz), psychotic bipolar disorder (pbd), and schizoaffective disorder; their first-degree relatives; and healthy control subjects.  the corpus callosum modulates interhemispheric communication and cognitive processes.  rather, the corpus callosum seems important for transferring lateralised information (such as verbal or visuospatial activity) of the pre-motor variety.  lesions of corpus callosum (cc) have not been studied in a broad population of patients with wd.  corpus callosum is the most important commissure of the brain and therefore represents a first-choice candidate to challenge hypotheses of disrupted inter-hemispheric connectivity and white matter pathology in patients with schizophrenia.  our findings indicate wilson's disease can involve the posterior as well as the anterior part of cc and patients with cc involvement had more extensive brain lesions, more severe neurological dysfunctions and psychiatric symptoms.  this study aimed to compare clinical features between wd-cca and wd without corpus callosum abnormalities (wd-no-cca).  corpus callosum shape abnormalities in first-episode psychotic patients with schizophrenia may reflect a midline neurodevelopmental abnormality.  this pictorial essay shows the mri findings in fetal corpus callosal developmental abnormalities in a very systematic manner. ||| ",yes
Is creatinine assessment included in the MELD score?,"although serum creatinine is included in the model for end-stage liver disease (meld) score, it is an inaccurate marker of renal function, namely, of glomerular filtration rate (""true"" gfr) in patients with decompensated cirrhosis.  although meld score seems to have a good performance in predicting aki after olt, serum creatinine had no impact on its prediction despite its importance on meld calculation.  the excellent short-term prognostic accuracy of the meld score was confirmed even when patients with abnormal creatinine serum levels were excluded from the analysis (c-index=0.935).  the meld score has shown that, besides markers of liver function, serum creatinine has a strong prognostic value in cirrhosis.  the model for end-stage liver disease (meld) score incorporates serum creatinine and was introduced to facilitate allocation of orthotopic liver transplantation (lt).  this study aimed to evaluate the impact of two creatinine measurement methods on the model for end stage liver disease (meld) score and glomerular filtration rate estimation (egfr) in cirrhotic patients.  median creatinine value was 0.85mg/dl and meld was 19.  creatinine is a standard marker for estimation of the transplanted kidney function.  however, the meld score proved to be better at defining patients' prognosis in the short-term as compared with both the traditional ctp score (p=0.012) and the creatinine-modified ctp (p=0.047).  the role of the model for end-stage liver disease (meld) score in predicting complications, such as acute kidney injury (aki), after orthotopic liver transplantation (olt) has yet to be evaluated and serum creatinine may be too heavily weighted in the existing meld formula, since it has many pitfalls in cirrhotic patients.  meld score, ckd-epi formula creatinine-based egfr and cystatin c-based egfr were evaluated in 100 cirrhotic patients.  the positive results obtained by using the meld score were confirmed even after excluding patients with impaired renal function.  the meld score has a short-term prognostic yield that is better than what is provided by both the ctp and ctp creatinine-modified scores, even in cirrhotic patients who are not critically ill.  ctp, creatinine-modified ctp, and meld scores were calculated in a cohort of 145 cirrhotic patients.  the only independent risk factor for aki was calculated meld and when the components of the meld score were analyzed, inr had a much stronger impact in predicting aki then serum creatinine.  the creatinine-modified ctp was calculated as follows: we assessed the mean creatinine serum level and standard deviation (sd) of the 145 study patients, then assigned a score of 1 to patients with creatinine serum levels < or = to the mean, a score of 2 to patients with creatinine levels between the mean and the mean+1 sd, and a score of 3 to patients with creatinine levels above the mean+1 sd.  to evaluate and compare the short-term prognostic accuracy of the ctp, the creatinine-modified ctp, and the meld scores in patients with liver cirrhosis.  the creatinine serum level is an important predictor of survival in patients with liver cirrhosis.  to investigate the impact of serum creatinine measurement on the applicability of glomerular filtration rate (gfr) evaluation equations.  the objective of this study was to review the accuracy of measured creatinine clearance (mcrcl) from timed urine collections for estimating true gfr. ||| ",yes
Is curcumin a phytochemical?,"curcumin (1,7-bis(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-1,6-heptadiene-3,5-dione) is a natural compound with antiproliferative properties.  curcumin (diferuloylmethane), an orange‑yellow component of turmeric or curry powder, is a polyphenol natural product isolated from the rhizome of curcuma longa.  curcumin (diferuloylmethane), an orange-yellow component of turmeric or curry powder, is a polyphenol natural product isolated from the rhizome of the plant curcuma longa.  curcumin, a phenolic compound from the rhizome of the plant curcuma longa has anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and anti-cancer activities.  curcumin (diferuloylmethane) is a chemical derived from several curcuma species (turmeric), possessing anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties and which, thus, may be a potential anticancer drug.  curcumin, a yellow pigment in asian spice, is a natural polyphenol component of curcuma longa rhizome.  thus, curcumin is one of the most promising phytochemicals that target various cancers and inflammation-mediated diseases.  curcumin, a natural, biologically active compound extracted from rhizomes of curcuma species, has been shown to possess potent anti-inflammatory, anti-tumor, and anti-oxidative properties.  for centuries, curcumin has been used in medicinal preparations and as a food colorant.  curcumin, a natural, biologically active compound extracted from rhizomes of curcuma species, has been shown to possess potent anti-inflammatory, anti-tumor and anti-oxidative properties.  curcumin, a polyphenol extracted from the plant curcuma longa, exhibits a number of pharmacological properties and has been used for the treatment of inﬂammatory diseases.  curcumin, a natural compound extracted from rhizomes of curcuma curcuma species, has been shown to possess potent anti-inflammatory, anti-tumor and anti-oxidative properties.  current research indicates curcumin  exerts a beneficial effect on health which may be partly attributable to its anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory properties.  curcumin, the active ingredient of the rhizome of the plant turmeric (curcuma longa linn), a commonly used spice, prevents cancer in animal tumor models.  curcumin, a member of the curcuminoid family of compounds, is a yellow colored phenolic pigment obtained from powdered rhizome of c. longa linn.  curcumin (1,7-bis(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-1,6-heptadiene-3,5-dione) is commonly used as a spice, food additive or dietary pigment.  for centuries, curcumin has been used in some medicinal preparation or used as a food-coloring agent.  the natural product curcumin has long been recognized for its medicinal properties and is utilized for the treatment of many diseases.  curcumin, a component of turmeric (curcuma longa), has been shown to exhibit chemopreventive activity.  this review summarizes various in vitro and in vivo pharmacological aspects of curcumin as well as the underlying action mechanisms. ||| ",yes
Is cystatin C or cystatin 3 used as a biomarker of kidney function?,"cystatin c is a promising kidney function marker.  cystatin c has been proposed as a surrogate marker of kidney function.  studies have questioned, however, whether cystatin c is predominantly a measure of kidney function.  recent studies suggest that serum cystatin c (cysc) is a more sensitive marker of renal functions than serum creatinine (cr).  urinary cystatin c (u-cysc) is a new biomarker for acute tubular kidney dysfunction and may also indicate chronic tubular dysfunction.  cystatin-c is an alternative and accurate marker of renal function in kt patients showing similar diagnostic characteristics to s-cr.  thus, to assess, whether cystatin c (cysc) provides better information on renal function than other markers, cysc, creatinine clearance (crcl), serum creatinine (scr), beta2-microglobulin (beta2-m), and 125i-iothalamate clearance were determined in 30 patients.  cystatin c (cysc) has been proposed as a more accurate marker of renal function than serum creatinine (scr).  serum cystatin c, a cysteine protease inhibitor, has been suggested as a new marker of glomerular filtration rate (gfr).  the significance of cystatin c for differentiating chronic kidney disease (ckd) stages and established cystatin c-based equations estimating gfr were evaluated.  cystatin c have shown to be a renal function parameter with higher sensitivity and specificity than serum creatinine.  s(cyst) levels of 1.4, 1.7, and 2.2 mg/l respectively predicted i-gfr levels of 80, 60, and 40 ml/minute/1.73 m. in conclusion, cystatin c is a reliable marker of renal function during the immediate post-olt period, especially when the goal is to identify moderate changes in gfr.  using cystatin c, a novel serum marker of kidney function, several studies have shown that mild kidney dysfunction is associated with increased risk for cardiovascular disease and mortality.  ckd stages were more sensitively differentiated by cystatin c compared to scr, especially in moderate and severe kidney dysfunction.  we have tried to define if different kinds of kidney diseases may significantly affect the serum levels of cystatin c. four hundred and four patients were studied: 249 men and 155 women, mean age was 64.3±10.1 years.  to verify whether cystatin c may be of some use as a renal function marker immediately after orthotopic liver transplantation (olt), we compared serum cystatin c (s(cyst)), serum creatinine (s(cr)), and creatinine clearance (c(cr)) levels with the glomerular filtration rate (gfr).  serum cystatin c was recently proposed as an alternative marker of glomerular filtration rate (gfr), with a suggested better performance than creatinine.  cystatin-c (cys-c) has been proposed as an alternative marker of renal function for the estimated glomerular filtration rate (egfr), which seems to be more accurate than s-cr.  the performance of serum cystatin c as a screening marker of reduced creatinine clearance in renal transplantation was evaluated and compared to serum creatinine.  cystatin c reflects kidney dysfunction sensitively, and thus cystatin c-based estimation of gfr could provide a reliable support for clinical practice. ||| ",yes
Is cytisine superior to nicotine replacement therapy for smoking cessation?,"cytisine is more effective than placebo and nicotine replacement therapy for smoking cessation.  we investigated whether cytisine was at least as effective as nicotine-replacement therapy in helping smokers to quit.  when combined with brief behavioral support, cytisine was found to be superior to nicotine-replacement therapy in helping smokers quit smoking, but it was associated with a higher frequency of self-reported adverse events.  the effectiveness of cytisine for continuous abstinence was superior to that of nicotine-replacement therapy at 1 week, 2 months, and 6 months.  cytisine is an effective treatment for smoking cessation with efficacy comparable to that of other currently licensed treatments.  in this single-center study, cytisine was more effective than placebo for smoking cessation.  a recent rigorous study has shown that cytisine, a low-cost drug, is effective for smoking cessation.  cytisine, a partial agonist that binds with high affinity to the α(4)β(2) nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, is a low-cost treatment that may be effective in aiding smoking cessation.  the safety, feasibility, and short-term efficacy of cytisine for smoking cessation were evaluated in active smokers with cad after percutaneous coronary interventions (pci).  in a prespecified subgroup analysis of the primary outcome, cytisine was superior to nicotine-replacement therapy among women and noninferior among men.  at 1 month, continuous abstinence from smoking was reported for 40% of participants receiving cytisine (264 of 655) and 31% of participants receiving nicotine-replacement therapy (203 of 655), for a difference of 9.3 percentage points (95% confidence interval, 4.2 to 14.5).  placebo-controlled trials indicate that cytisine, a partial agonist that binds the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor and is used for smoking cessation, almost doubles the chances of quitting at 6 months.  a systematic review was undertaken to assess the efficacy of cytisine in smoking cessation.  the lower price of cytisine as compared with that of other pharmacotherapies for smoking cessation may make it an affordable treatment to advance smoking cessation globally.  cytisine tablets are very inexpensive to produce and could be a more affordable treatment than nicotine replacement, bupropion and varenicline.  if cytisine is as effective as varenicline, its lower cost and natural plant-based composition may make it an acceptable and affordable smoking cessation medication that could save millions of lives world-wide.  while cytisine has been found to be well-tolerated and more effective than nicotine replacement therapy, direct comparisons with varenicline have not been conducted.  three placebo-controlled trials, conducted in east and west germany in the 1960s and 1970s, suggest that cytisine, even with minimal behavioural support, may be effective in aiding smoking cessation.  although cytisine reversed several effects of nicotine, it seemed to have a reduced potential to produce withdrawal signs in nicotine-dependent subjects.  to examine whether standard cytisine treatment (25 days) was at least as effective as standard varenicline treatment (84 days) for smoking cessation. ||| ",yes
Is dasatinib effective for treatment of glioblastoma?,"these results strongly support the clinical use of dasatinib in the treatment of glioblastoma and provide a rationale for combination therapy with dasatinib and temozolomide.  dasatinib, a new-generation src and platelet-derived growth factor receptor (pdgfr) inhibitor, is currently under evaluation in high-grade glioma clinical trials.  in vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated inhibition of glioblastoma growth by imatinib mesylate (gleevec).  in this phase i study of recurrent glioblastoma patients, the combination of ccnu and dasatinib showed significant hematological toxicities and led to suboptimal exposure to both agents.  gefitinib, a selective epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, is under clinical testing and use in cancer patients, including glioma.  background: although programmed death-1 (pd-1) blockade is effective in treating several types of cancer, the efficacy of this agent in glioblastoma (gbm) is largely unknown.  it has also been evaluated in several clinical trials for treatment of brain tumors such as high-grade glioma.  in conclusion, darapladib acts as a potential anti-glioma compound via the induction of mitochondrial membrane depolarization and cell apoptosis, and the inhibition of akt signaling in glioma cells.  this open-label, phase ii trial evaluated cabozantinib in patients with recurrent or refractory glioblastoma (gbm).  dasatinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, has been approved for first-line treatment of leukemia and has also been evaluated for use in numerous other cancers.  here we retrospectively assessed the efficacy and toxicity of temozolomide plus apatinib, an oral small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor targeting vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 in recurrent glioblastoma.  epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors, including gefitinib, have been evaluated in patients with malignant gliomas.  in studying the action of dasatinib in human glioblastoma, we found that levels of phospho-src, akt, and ribosomal protein s6 were decreased in cell lines treated with low nanomolar concentrations of dasatinib at baseline and following stimulation with epidermal growth factor.  imatinib is an inhibitor of the tyrosine kinase activities of platelet-derived growth factor receptor (pdgf-r), which is involved in glioblastoma aggressiveness.  to determine the maximum tolerated dose (mtd) and dose-limiting toxicity (dlt) of dasatinib, an inhibitor of the src family kinase proteins, with erlotinib, an epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, among recurrent malignant glioma patients.  dasatinib is a new selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets certain kinases involved in cellular growth and development.  combination treatment of glioma cells with dasatinib and temozolomide resulted in a significant increase in cell cycle disruption and autophagic cell death.  a retrospective analysis of patients with recurrent glioblastoma who underwent apatinib plus temozolomide treatment was performed.  treatment for recurrent glioblastoma is poor, and there is a need for better therapies.  we used a novel fluorinated dasatinib derivative (f-ski249380), in combination with nanocarrier vehicles and metabolic imaging tools (micropet) to evaluate drug delivery and uptake in a platelet-derived growth factor b (pdgfb)-driven genetically engineered mouse model (gemm) of high-grade glioma. ||| ",no
Is davunetide being considered for the treatment of progressive supranuclear palsy?,"because progressive supranuclear palsy (psp) is linked to tau pathology, davunetide could be a treatment for psp.  we assessed the safety and efficacy of davunetide in patients with psp.  introduction: amantadine anecdotally improves gait in progressive supranuclear palsy (psp) but definitive data is lacking.  we aimed to investigate the safety and tolerability of biib092 in individuals with progressive supranuclear palsy.  progressive supranuclear palsy (psp) is a debilitating progressive neurodegenerative disorder for which there is no proven pharmacological treatment.  to date, pharmacological treatment options for progressive supranuclear palsy (psp), a neurodegenerative tauopathy, are limited.  davunetide is not an effective treatment for psp.  davunetide (al-108, nap) is an intranasally administered peptide currently being developed for treatment of alzheimer's disease and related disorders.  participants aged 41-86 years with probable or possible progressive supranuclear palsy with a score of 20 or greater on the mini-mental state examination (mmse) were enrolled.  progressive supranuclear palsy (psp) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder with no effective treatment.  davunetide (nap) is a leading drug candidate being tested against tauopathy.  biib092 is a humanised monoclonal antibody that binds to n-terminal tau and is thus being assessed as a potential novel treatment for progressive supranuclear palsy.  repeated administration of the anti-tau monoclonal antibody biib092, at doses of up to 2100 mg, appears to be well tolerated in participants with progressive supranuclear palsy.  progressive supranuclear palsy is a rare neurodegenerative disease associated with dysfunctional tau protein.  discussion: this post-hoc analysis of the davunetide trial did not find an association between amantadine and gait or cognitive measures in psp, but was not powered to find such a difference.  sixty-three subjects with schizophrenia received davunetide at one of two different doses (5, 30 mg) or placebo for 12 weeks in a multicenter, double-blind, parallel-group randomized clinical trial.  pre- and post-operative objective overall motor and gait subsection scores as well as patient-reported outcomes were recorded for 6 ppn-dbs-treated patients, 3 with parkinson's disease (pd), and 3 with progressive supranuclear palsy (psp).  this study investigates effects of davunetide on cognition in schizophrenia.  clinical trials for treatment of parkinson's disease suggest that (-)deprenyl (selegiline), an inhibitor of type b monoamine oxidase, may slow the disease progression.  the datatop study is a clinical trial in which deprenyl, a selective inhibitor of monoamine oxidase-b (mao-b), is being given to newly diagnosed parkinsonian patients in an attempt to halt the progression of their disorder. ||| ",yes
Is delayed enhancement documented in patients with non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy?,"all patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy and prior myocardial infarction (54 subjects) showed delayed enhancement with subendocardial (n = 4) or transmural (n = 50) extension.  among the 22 patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy but without previous myocardial infarction, 13 (59%) showed either subendocardial (n = 4) or transmural (n = 9) delayed enhancement.  the authors discuss the use of delayed enhancement for differentiation between ischemic and nonischemic myocardial disease and for narrowing the differential diagnosis when nonischemic etiologies are suspected.  in the dilated cardiomyopathy group, only seven (29%) patients showed delayed enhancement and its pattern was characterized by mid-wall, patchy or diffuse location.  patterns of delayed enhancement are different in dilated cardiomyopathy and ischemic cardiomyopathy, reflecting the presence of scarring or various degrees of fibrosis in left ventricular myocardium.  this review highlights the role of delayed enhancement magnetic resonance imaging for the diagnosis of patients with nonischemic myocardial disease.  the presence of subendocardial or transmural delayed enhancement at contrast-enhanced cardiovascular magnetic resonance allowed distinction between dilated cardiomyopathy and ischemic cardiomyopathy with high sensitivity (88%) and specificity (100%).  in nonischemic cardiomyopathy, the delayed enhancement usually does not occur in a coronary artery distribution and is often midwall rather than subendocardial or transmural.  myocardial delayed enhancement on cmr after administration of contrast accurately delineates a scar, a powerful marker of poor prognosis in dilated cardiomyopathy.  lately, delayed myocardial enhancement mr imaging has been developed and is currently being used for a growing number of clinical applications.  unlike myocardial infarction, which demonstrates subendocardial or transmural delayed contrast enhancement in a vascular distribution, nonischemic cardiomyopathies demonstrate enhancement that is not limited to a vascular territory.  patients with non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (dcm) often show ischemia-like electrocardiographic findings.  the presence of late gadolinium enhancement (lge) at the right ventricular insertion point (rvip) on cardiac magnetic resonance (cmr) is generally believed to be nonspecific, but the clinical implication of this unique lge pattern in patients with non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (nicm) has not been elucidated.  in combination with other cardiac mr imaging features, the location (subendocardial, transmural, subepicardial, or mesocardial) and pattern (patchy or diffuse) of abnormal delayed myocardial enhancement allow differentiation between ischemic (infarct-related) and nonischemic cardiomyopathies and, in cases of nonischemic cardiomyopathy, narrowing of the differential diagnosis.  to investigate the prognostic impact of left-ventricular (lv) cardiac magnetic resonance (cmr) deformation imaging in patients with non-ischaemic dilated cardiomyopathy (dcm) compared with late-gadolinium enhancement (lge) quantification and lv ejection fraction (ef).  contrast-enhanced cardiovascular magnetic resonance was performed in 100 patients with left ventricular dilatation and reduced systolic function: 24 had normal coronary arteries (dilated cardiomyopathy group) and 76 had significant coronary artery disease (ischemic cardiomyopathy group), with or without previous myocardial infarction.  to distinguish between ischemic and nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (dcm), we studied 43 patients with left ventricular dysfunction (15 ischemic and 28 nonischemic detected by coronary angiography) by dobutamine stress echocardiography.  dobutamine stress echocardiography safely provides diagnostic information in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy.  although delayed contrast material-enhanced cardiac magnetic resonance (mr) imaging has traditionally been used to evaluate ischemic disease and myocardial viability, it is increasingly being used in the evaluation of nonischemic cardiomyopathies.  to evaluate whether the extracellular volume fraction (ecv) measured using cardiac magnetic resonance (cmr) imaging can detect myocardial tissue changes in dilated cardiomyopathy (dcm) without late gadolinium enhancement (lge). ||| ",yes
Is depression associated with poor prognosis of brain tumor patients?,"depression as a common complication of brain tumors.  it remains unclear if clinical depression affects survival after surgical management of malignant brain astrocytoma.  in our experience, patients who are actively depressed at the time of surgery were associated with decreased survival after surgical management of malignant astrocytoma, independent of degree of disability, tumor grade, or subsequent treatment modalities.  depression was associated with significantly worsened survival regardless of time of diagnosis, especially among patients with high-grade glioma.  depression in cancer patients is prevalent and negatively impacts their quality of life.  depression appears to be associated with worse survival from cancer, but underlying mechanisms for this association are unknown.  preoperative depressive symptoms are associated with poor outcomes in patients with an astrocytoma.  depression and neurocognitive function, particularly executive functioning (ef), have been associated with overall survival (os) in patients with glioblastoma (gbm).  in the present study, we explored the degree to which tumor genotype may be associated with depression in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (nsclc).  depression can have debilitating effects on patients with a chronic morbid disease, in particular, cancer.  although depression appears to be associated with worse survival from cancer, the underlying mechanisms of this association are unknown.  depression is associated with worse survival in metastatic nsclc, and this relationship may be at least partially explained by tumor egfr genotype.  the aim of this meta-analysis was to study the effect of depression on glioma patients' survival.  depression is a common symptom among gastric cancer (gc) patients and serves as a potential indication of poor prognosis and advanced cancer clinical stage.  using re model, the various measures for survival outcomes displayed worsened outcomes for both high and low-grade glioma patients with depression compared to those without depression.  the findings indicated that depression could influence the association between cognitive functioning and qol in breast cancer patients.  at present, it is not clear whether mood disorders (md) and poor health related quality of life (hrqol) in the glioma population correlate with features of the tumor, or rather with secondary symptoms associated with treatment.  we investigated this possible relationship in a cohort of patients with metastatic nsclc, in which we had previously demonstrated an association between depression and worse survival.  is there a possible common pathogenesis for depression and glioma?  cytokines are associated with depressive symptoms in the general population and are important mediators of tumor growth and progression.the aims of this study were to: (1) characterize depressive symptoms, other treatment-related symptoms and biological mediators; and (2) determine whether preoperative depressive symptoms were associated with the selected biological mediators. ||| ",yes
Is desmin an intermediate filament protein involved in Dilated Cardiomyopathy (DCM)?,"desmin is one of five major intermediate filament proteins in cardiomyocytes.  it has been confirmed recently that a missense mutation of the gene encoding desmin, a cytoskeletal protein, can cause dilated cardiomyopathy.  the intermediate filament protein desmin is an integral component of the cardiomyocyte and serves to maintain the overall structure and cytoskeletal organization within striated muscle cells.  desmin is the major protein component of the intermediate filaments (ifs) cytoskeleton in muscle cells, including cardiac.  desmin, one of the basic muscular-specific structural proteins, is believed to play an important role in the progression of heart failure (hf).  desmin-related cardiomyopathy is a heterogeneous group of myofibrillar myopathies characterized by aggregates of desmin and related proteins in myocytes.  the exon 8 of the desmin gene, the critical region for the pathogenesis of dilated cardiomyopathy, was analysed by polymerase chain reaction, single-strand conformation polymorphism and sequencing.  desmin is one of the fundamental cytoskeleton proteins of cardiomyocytes, and has a mechanical, structural and regulatory function.  desmin-related myopathy (drm) is known to cause different types of cardiomyopathy.  this study was aimed at elucidating the frequency and clinical characteristics of dilated cardiomyopathy caused by desmin mutation.  the missense mutation (ile451met) of the desmin gene can be the genetic cause of dilated cardiomyopathy, although with very low frequency.  it has been suggested that remodeling of desmin cytoskeleton might contribute to the progression of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy and might affect patients' long-term prognosis.  in this review, we examine the cellular phenotypes in relevant animal models of desmin-related cardiomyopathy.  the accumulation of cleaved and misfolded desmin is a cellular hallmark of heart failure (hf).  in conclusion, in patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, a decrease or lack of desmin expression seems to be a strong, independent predictor of an unfavorable prognosis.  mutations in the human desmin gene cause cardiac disease, remodeling, and heart failure but the pathophysiological mechanisms remain unknown.  we emphasize the similarities observed between desmin-related cardiomyopathy and other protein conformational disorders and speculate that therapies to treat this disease may be broadly applicable to diverse protein aggregation-based disorders.  cardiomyocyte-specific overexpression of mutated desmin (a 7 amino acid deletion r172-e178, d7-des tg) causes accumulations of electron-dense aggregates and myofibrillar degeneration associated with cardiac dysfunction.  desmin was detected with immunohistochemical staining of cardiomyocytes.  dilated cardiomyopathy (dcm), as one of the common cardiomyopathies, is a disease of the heart muscle; however, the etiology and pathogenesis of dcm were still poorly understood. ||| ",yes
Is dexamethasone recommended for treatment of intracerebral hemorrhage?,"in conclusion, dexamethasone administered shortly after an intracerebral hematoma appears beneficial for the treatment of this condition.  dexamethasone was evaluated for the treatment of intracerebral hemorrhage using a rat model of cerebral hematoma induced by intracerebral injection of collagenase.  the indication for surgery in spontaneous intracerebral hematoma is given when, in spite of the administration of dexamethasone in high dosage, an improvement of the initial neurological symptoms could not be observed, or if a worsening is seen.  corticosteroids, particularly dexamethasone, are commonly used for treatments in patients with subarachnoid haemorrhage (sah) and primary intracerebral haemorrhage (pich) despite the lack of evidence.  in neurosurgery practice, dexamethasone (dex) is commonly used particularly in cerebral edema secondary to brain tumors, head trauma, and central nervous system infections.  dexamethasone has been used to manage brain edema in patients with intracranial abscess.  dexamethasone has been used to treat cerebral edema associated with brain abscess.  some studies have demonstrated the role of dexamethasone in the medical management of chronic subdural hematoma.  indication and timing of pharmacological venous thromboembolism prophylaxis in intracerebral hemorrhage patients is controversial.  indications to administer dexamethasone were either hospital brain abscess protocol or clinical presentation of cerebral edema.  patients with acute intracerebral hemorrhage (<6 hours) and elevated systolic blood pressure were included; patients received subcutaneous heparin following local best practice standards of care.  to determine whether use of subcutaneous heparin during the first 7 days after spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage increases risks of death and disability.  although there is no approved pharmacological intervention, such cerebral oedema is usually treated with dexamethasone.  use of subcutaneous heparin is associated with poor outcome in acute intracerebral hemorrhage, driven by increased residual disability.  despite the limitations of this study, and no clear relation of heparin with bleeding risk, we recommend careful consideration of the need for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis with heparin in intracerebral hemorrhage patients.  if dexamethasone is used, even as a single dose during craniotomy, intraoperative blood glucose concentrations should be carefully monitored and hyperglycemia treated, particularly in patients at risk for glucose-mediated exacerbation of brain injury.  dexamethasone has been shown in experimental studies to reduce cerebral oedema with only few mineralocorticoid side-effects.  dexamethasone, a synthetic glucocorticoid, is routinely prescribed with antineoplastic agents to alleviate pain associated with chemotherapy and reduce intracranial pressure.  current opinions regarding the use of dexamethasone in the treatment of chronic subdural hematomas (csdh) are only based on observational studies.  dexamethasone, a corticosteroid used to treat cerebral edema, is known to produce elevations in the blood glucose concentration, but the effect of a single intraoperative dose of dexamethasone on the blood glucose concentration is unknown. ||| ",no
Is dichlorphenamide effective for periodic paralysis?,"in two trials in patients with hypokalaemic periodic paralysis, dichlorphenamide was associated with a significantly (eightfold) lower paralytic attack rate and fewer patients with acute intolerable worsening compared with placebo.  as the first agent to be approved in the usa for this indication, dichlorphenamide is a valuable treatment option for patients with primary hyperkalaemic or hypokalaemic periodic paralysis.  to determine the short-term and long-term effects of dichlorphenamide (dcp) on attack frequency and quality of life in hyperkalemic (hyp) and hypokalemic (hop) periodic paralysis.  in 52-week, open-label extensions of the hop and hyp trials, dichlorphenamide provided sustained efficacy in patients with hypokalaemic or hyperkalaemic periodic paralysis.  in two trials in patients with hyperkalaemic periodic paralysis, the attack rate was lower with dichlorphenamide than placebo, with this comparison reaching statistical significance in one trial (crossover) but not the other (hyp), although the attack rate was approximately fivefold lower with dichlorphenamide than placebo in the hyp trial.  the efficacy and safety of dichlorphenamide in patients with primary periodic paralyses have been evaluated in four 9-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase iii trials .  therefore, we tested the efficacy of dichlorphenamide (dcp; daranide), a potent carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, in the treatment of episodic weakness in the primary pps.  patients with primary periodic paralyses in a double-blind, controlled, crossover study were randomized to dichlorphenamide or placebo for nine weeks, with a nine-week or longer between-treatment washout period.  dcp is effective in reducing the attack frequency, is safe, and improves quality of life in hop periodic paralysis.  dichlorphenamide was generally well tolerated in all four phase iii trials and during the extension trials; the most common adverse events were paraesthesia, cognitive disorders and dysgeusia.  this analysis describes effects of dichlorphenamide among adolescents and adults.  dichlorphenamide was effective and well tolerated in two studies, including one with adolescents.  dichlorphenamide was comparably effective and tolerated among a small number of adolescents as well as adults, although types of adverse events differed between groups.  we performed two multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trials, one involving 42 subjects with hypokalemic periodic paralysis (hypopp) and the other involving 31 subjects with potassium-sensitive periodic paralysis (pspp).  severity-weighted attack frequency was likewise reduced more with dichlorphenamide than with placebo in adolescents and adults.  we evaluated whether droxidopa, a prodrug converted to norepinephrine, is beneficial in the treatment of symptomatic neurogenic orthostatic hypotension, which results from failure to generate an appropriate norepinephrine response to postural challenge.  oral dichlorphenamide (keveyis™) is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor that is approved in the usa for the treatment of primary hyperkalaemic and hypokalaemic periodic paralyses and related variants.  in adolescents, the median decrease from baseline in frequency of weekly attacks was greater with dichlorphenamide (-0.96) than with placebo (-0.57), similar to findings in adults (dichlorphenamide, -0.83; placebo, -0.24).  the relative efficacy of trihexiphenidyl hydrochloride, amantadine hydrochloride, and low-dose carbidopa-levodopa in reducing parkinsonian tremor was investigated using objective techniques.  although diphenhydramine hydrochloride is known to eliminate or reduce the symptoms of dystonia in human patients with acute dystonic reactions and idiopathic torsion dystonia, its mechanism of action is still unclear. ||| ",yes
Is diphosphatidylglycerol (cardiolipin) a phospholipid of the mitochondrial membranes?,"cardiolipin is a major membrane phospholipid in the mitochondria and is essential for cellular energy metabolism mediated through mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation.  cardiolipin (cl) is a unique dimeric phospholipid localized primarily in the mitochondrial membrane.  the mechanism of cardiolipin (diphosphatidylglycerol) biosynthesis was examined in mitochondria and outer and inner mitochondrial membranes prepared from guinea pig and rat livers to determine whether this formation from phosphatidylglycerol was absolutely dependent on cytidinediphosphodiglyceride, as previously reported for intact mitochondria.  cardiolipin (cl), a tetra-acylated glycerophospholipid composed of two phosphatidyl moieties linked by a bridging glycerol, plays an important role in mitochondrial function in eukaryotic cells.  cardiolipin is a major phospholipid in mitochondria and is involved in the generation of cellular energy in the form of atp.  while mitochondria contain all the major classes of phospholipids, recent studies have highlighted specific roles of the nonbilayer-forming phospholipids phosphatidylethanolamine (pe) and cardiolipin (cl) in the assembly and activity of mitochondrial respiratory chain (mrc) complexes.  molecular species in the three major mitochondrial lipids cardiolipin, phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine were analysed in bovine heart and saccharomyces cerevisiae.  the phospholipid cardiolipin, or diphosphatidylglycerol, is ubiquitous in eucaryotes.  the mitochondrial phospholipid cardiolipin is synthesized from cytidinediphosphate-diacylglycerol and phosphatidylglycerol, a process catalyzed by the enzyme cardiolipin synthase.  mitochondrial lipid metabolism involves biosynthesis of the phospholipids phosphatidylethanolamine, cardiolipin and phosphatidylglycerol, the latter is a precursor of the late endosomal lipid bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate.  cardiolipin is the principal polyglycerophospholipid found in the heart and most mammalian tissues.  eukaryotic cardiolipin is synthesized de novo from phosphatidic acid via the cytidine-5'-diphosphate-1,2-diacyl-sn-glycerol pathway and is deacylated to monolysocardiolipin in order for it to be remodelled into the form that is observed in mitochondrial membranes.  mitochondrial structure and function are influenced by the unique phospholipid composition of its membranes.  experimental results confirmed that the biosynthesis of cardiolipin, from the membrane-bound radioactive phosphatidylglycerol in intact mitochondria isolated from guinea pig and rat liver, was absolutely dependent on cdp-diglycerides and required the addition of divalent cations.  the interaction of the three main components of the mitochondrial membrane, namely cardiolipin, phosphatidylcholine, and phosphatidylethanolamine, has been studied investigating mixed cardiolipin-phosphatidylcholine and cardiolipin-phosphatidylethanolamine monolayers at different cardiolipin molar fractions.  mitochondrial dysfunction is implicated in neurodegenerative, cardiovascular, and metabolic disorders, but the role of phospholipids, particularly the nonbilayer-forming lipid phosphatidylethanolamine (pe), in mitochondrial function is poorly understood.  although phosphatidylglycerol, cardiolipin, and phosphatidylethanolamine are synthesized by mitochondrial enzymes, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylserine, and sterols need to be imported from other organelles.  in both organisms cardiolipin contains mainly diacylglycerol moieties with two unsaturated chains and a significant higher proportion of c18-c18 species than phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine.  mitochondrial cardiolipin synthase catalyzes the transfer of a phosphatidyl moiety from phosphatidyl-cmp (ptdcmp) to phosphatidylglycerol (ptdgro) in the presence of specific divalent cations.  mitochondria exert critical functions in cellular lipid metabolism and promote the synthesis of major constituents of cellular membranes, such as phosphatidylethanolamine (pe) and phosphatidylcholine. ||| ",yes

Is edema a symptom of nephrotic syndrome?,"the pathogenesis of edema in nephrotic syndrome is not entirely understood.  because edema is a common presenting feature and hypertension and dyslipidemia are often present in nephrotic syndrome, it is important for the primary care physician to suspect this entity.  edema formation in nephrotic syndrome has been attributed to intravascular volume depletion resulting from leakage of plasma water into the interstitial space and activating secondary renal sodium retention.  oedema is the commonest presenting symptom and sign in nephrotic syndrome.  nephrotic syndrome usually presents with oedema due to fluid accumulation in subcutaneous space.  the aim of this study was to contribute to the discussion on edema pathogenesis in nephrotic syndrome by following changes in volume and sodium retention for the course of the disease in children with steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome (ssns).  oedema formation in nephrotic syndrome (ns) may be associated with volume overload or volume contraction.  the nephrotic syndrome is defined by edema, hypoalbuminemia, proteinuria, and hyperlipemia with elevated cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations in serum or plasma.  peripheral edema, in combination with severe proteinuria and low serum albumin levels, is pathognomonic of the nephrotic syndrome, yet the exact mechanism of its formation is unknown.  nephrotic syndrome, characterized by edema, proteinuria, hyperlipidemia and low serum albumin, is a manifestation of kidney disease involving the glomeruli.  three patients are described, each of whose nephrotic syndrome presented with a less common symptom or sign--recurrent pleural effusion, hypercholesterolaemia and oedema, pulmonary embolism--and, as a result, experienced some diagnostic delay.  nephrotic syndrome with idiopathic membranous nephropathy as a major contributor, is characterized by proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia and oedema.  an increase in cfc provides a potentially novel mechanism contributing at least in part to the formation of peripheral edema in the nephrotic syndrome.  however, clinical studies indicate that edematous patients with nephrotic syndrome may have normal or expanded plasma volumes.  in addition, hypoalbuminemia and sodium retention of the proximal tubule cause edema in children with ssns.  nephrotic syndrome is one cause of end-stage kidney disease.  this article describes the pathophysiology, incidence, clinical presentation, treatment, and disease progression of these nephritic syndrome entities, and provides guidance for when to refer to a nephrologist.  nephritic syndrome is a constellation of hematuria, proteinuria, hypertension, and in some cases acute kidney injury and fluid retention characteristic of acute glomerulonephritis.  fifteen nephrotic subjects with a variety of underlying pathological lesions, and age matched controls were studied.  the exact role of atrial natriutetic peptide (anp) in the pathogenesis of edema in nephrotic syndrome (ns) has not been fully elucidated. ||| ",yes
Is endostatin a proangiogenic factor?,"endostatin was suggested to be an antiangiogenic agent with the potential for clinical use in cancer therapy.  endostatin, a fragment of the basement membrane component collagen xviii, exhibits antiangiogenic properties in vitro and in vivo when high doses are administered.  endostatin, a c-terminal fragment of collagen xviii, is an endogenous angiogenesis inhibitor.  endostatin is known to influence the vascular endothelial growth factor (vegf) signaling pathway.  experimental data imply that endostatin, a proteolytically cleaved fragment of collagen xviii, could be involved in the development of cardiovascular disease and cancer.  these findings demonstrate that endogenous endostatin is an inhibitor of induced angiogenesis and that administration of endostatin potently inhibits cnv growth and vascular leakage.  endoglin is a proliferation-associated antigen on endothelial cells and essential for angiogenesis.  endostatin, generated from collagen xviii, and endorepellin, possess dual activity as modifiers of both angiogenesis and endothelial cell autophagy.  the authors conclude that endostatin affects vegf signaling in endothelial cells by a post-transcriptional pp2a-dependent down-regulation of sgc protein levels.  high serum endostatin was associated with increased mortality risk in 2 independent community-based cohorts of the elderly.  in the univariable cox survival analysis, higher endostatin levels were associated with a higher risk for both outcomes.  endoglin, a tgf-β coreceptor predominantly expressed in endothelial cells, plays an important role in vascular development and tumor-associated angiogenesis.  it is not known whether endogenous endostatin at physiological levels has a protective role as an inhibitor of pathological angiogenesis, such as choroidal neovascularization (cnv) in age-related macular degeneration.  in the ulsam cohort, serum endostatin was also associated with cardiovascular mortality (177 deaths; hazard ratio per sd of ln 1.45, 95% confidence interval ) and cancer mortality (115 deaths; hazard ratio per sd of ln 1.35, 95% confidence interval ).  accordingly, we aimed to study associations between circulating endostatin and mortality risk.  in a previous study, we found that β3-endonexin expressed in vascular endothelial cells was involved in promoting proliferation and angiogenesis partially by facilitating vegf expression.  vascular endothelial growth factor (vegf) has been shown to be the major mediator of physiologic and pathologic angiogenesis.  endocrine glands-derived vascular endothelial growth factor (eg-vegf, also termed as prok1)--a novel cytokine that selectively acts on the endothelial cells of endocrine glands--was recently reported to be involved in the regulation of tumor cell growth and survival.  while endostatin is being investigated for its usefulness in treating solid tumors, its significance in hematologic malignancies is unknown.  this study demonstrate a novel mechanism by which endoglin initiates and regulates vegf-driven angiogenesis while providing a rationale for combining anti-vegf and anti-endoglin therapy in patients with cancer.-tian, h., huang, j. j., golzio, c., gao, x., hector-greene, m., katsanis, n., blobe, g. c. endoglin interacts with vegfr2 to promote angiogenesis. ||| ",no
Is enzastaurin effective treatment of glioblastoma?,"enzastaurin has anti-glioma activity in patients with recurrent high-grade glioma, but does not appear to have enough single-agent activity to be useful as monotherapy.  the initial objective of this study was to assess the efficacy of enzastaurin in a series of malignant human glioma cell lines with diverse genomic alterations.  enzastaurin, a potent inhibitor of protein kinase c-beta, inhibits angiogenesis and has direct cytotoxic activity against glioma cells in preclinical studies.  although enzastaurin independently produced a dose-dependent inhibition of cellular proliferation and decreased cell viability in each of the glioma cell lines examined, and partially down-regulated akt and gsk3beta phosphorylation, median effective concentrations were at the upper limits of, or above, the clinically achievable range in all cell lines tested.  enzastaurin is emerging as a promising new antitumor treatment.  several preliminary studies showed promising results in patients with various advanced cancers and suggested that enzastaurin can be safely used long term in combination with traditional chemotherapies.  enzastaurin - a novel oral antitumor agent that selectively inhibits protein kinase cbeta activity - has demonstrated promise in phase i and ii trials in various advanced cancers, and is being investigated in multiple hematologic malignancies and solid tumors.  enzastaurin (ly317615.hci), a protein kinase c (pkc)-beta inhibitor, has a radiosensitising effect on 4t1 murine breast cancer and human glioma cells; however, the exact mechanism of this action has not been evaluated.  taken together, these findings suggest that the efficacy of enzastaurin can be potentiated by the addition of 17-aag, and indicate that combining molecularly targeted therapies may provide a more effective strategy than single-agent therapy to treat patients with malignant gliomas.  enzastaurin (ly317615) was initially developed as an antiangiogenic cancer therapy.  remarkably, these results were confirmed in vivo, where enzastaurin showed antitumour activity and cooperativity with gefitinib in mice grafted with geo and geo-gr tumours, incrementing their median survival and inhibiting the aforesaid protein expression and secretion in tumour specimens.  we analysed the anti-tumour effects of enzastaurin in 22 lung cancer cell lines to ascertain the potential for enzastaurin-based treatment of lung cancer.  enzastaurin (ly317615.hcl) is an oral selective pkc-beta inhibitor with antiproliferative efficacy in various tumor models.  in conclusion, enzastaurin by interfering with signalling proteins implicated in egfr drug resistance markedly cooperates with gefitinib in sensitive and gefitinib-resistant tumours, thus overcoming and reverting such resistance and providing a rational basis for its development in patients resistant to anti-egfr drugs.  enzastaurin was evaluated alone and in combination with the egfr inhibitor gefitinib, on growth and signalling protein expression in human cancer cells sensitive and resistant to anti-egfr drugs, both in vitro and in nude mice.  enzastaurin showed preclinical antitumor activity against human tcc and enhanced the activity of gemcitabine.  enzastaurin displays pro-apoptotic properties against a spectrum of malignancies and is currently being investigated in clinical trials.  this review addresses the mechanism of action, development, preclinical studies, and clinical study results with enzastaurin.  enzastaurin induced significant apoptosis and inhibited proliferation in vitro at low micromolar concentrations.  enzastaurin alone presented not active in renal cell carcinoma cell lines. ||| ",no
Is exome sequencing efficient for the detection of germline mutations?,"exome sequencing is an efficient tool to identify disease mutations without the need of a multi-generational pedigree.  the most sensitive technique for the detection of germline mutations is exon by exon sequencing of the gene under investigation using genomic dna as a template for analysis.  exome sequencing, which allows the global analysis of protein coding sequences in the human genome, has become an effective and affordable approach to detecting causative genetic mutations in diseases.  whole exome sequencing of patients can be a cost-effective alternative to standard genetic screenings to find causative mutations of genetic diseases, especially when the number of cases is limited.  beginning in 2009, the advent of exome sequencing has contributed significantly towards new discoveries of heritable germline mutations and de novo mutations for rare mendelian disorders with hitherto unknown genetic aetiologies.  whole-exome or whole-genome sequencing is becoming routine in clinical situations for identifying mutations underlying presumed genetic causes of disease including infertility.  with the rapid advances in high-throughput sequencing technologies, exome sequencing and targeted region sequencing have become routine approaches for identifying mutations of inherited disorders in both genetics research and molecular diagnosis.  while whole-genome sequencing may capture all possible mutations, whole-exome sequencing remains cost-effective and captures most phenotype-altering mutations.  exome sequencing has the capability of reliably identifying inherited and de novo single-nucleotide variants, small insertions, and deletions.  in addition to heritable germline and de novo mutations, exome sequencing has also succeeded in unravelling somatic driver mutations for a wide range of cancers through individual studies or international collaborative effort such as the cancer genome international consortium.  whole exome sequencing has become a pivotal methodology for rapid and cost-effective detection of pathogenic variations in mendelian disorders.  exome sequencing enables us to screen most of the protein coding genes in an unbiased way, this technique represents an ideal tool to identify previously under- or unappreciated phenotypes associated with known disease genes and genetic disorders.  massively parallel dna sequencing, such as exome sequencing, has become a routine clinical procedure to identify pathogenic variants responsible for a patient's phenotype.  there is an imminent need for comprehensive and easy-to-use downstream analysis tools to isolate causal mutations in exome sequencing studies.  on top of research discoveries, the application of exome sequencing as a diagnostic tool is also increasingly evident.  this tool will greatly facilitate the downstream analysis of exome sequencing data and can play a useful role for researchers and clinicians in identifying causal mutations of inherited disorders.  we conclude that combination of mutation detection methods with dna sequencing enhances the efficiency of identifying pathogenic mutations.  exome sequencing has proven to be an effective tool to discover the genetic basis of mendelian disorders.  detection of these mutations by dna sequencing can be made more efficient by using mutation detection methods for pre-screening to identify the affected exon and to screen for the presence of already identified mutations in family members.  next-generation sequencing and exome-capture technologies are currently revolutionizing the way geneticists screen for disease-causing mutations in rare mendelian disorders. ||| ",yes
Is exon skipping correlated with exon circularization?,"by using genome-wide approaches and circular rna recapitulation, we demonstrate that exon circularization is dependent on flanking intronic complementary sequences.  some genes do not require complementary sequences to generate rna circles and instead take advantage of exon skipping events.  strikingly, exon circularization efficiency can be regulated by competition between rna pairing across flanking introns or within individual introns.  exon circularization has been identified from many loci in mammals, but the detailed mechanism of its biogenesis has remained elusive.  such sequences and their distribution exhibit rapid evolutionary changes, showing that exon circularization is evolutionarily dynamic.  the sequences of exons in circular rnas are identical to their linear cognate mrnas, but the circular format may confer constraints on their folding and conformation, leading to potentially different functions from their linear rna cognates.  furthermore, we have performed high-throughput and comprehensive mutagenesis of a circle-forming exon, which enabled us to discover a systematic effect of exon length on rna circularization.  exons that circularize are often flanked by intronic repeat sequences that are complementary to one another, and backsplicing is triggered when these repeats base pair and bring the intervening splice sites into close proximity.  collectively, exon circularization mediated by complementary sequences in human introns and the potential to generate alternative circularization products extend the complexity of mammalian posttranscriptional regulation.  despite overlapping sequences, exon circularization generates rna secondary structures through intramolecular base-pairing that are different from the linear transcript.  circular rna from backspliced exons (or exonic circular rna, circrna) is a type of covalently closed non-colinear rna that was recently rediscovered in eukaryotes.  exonic circular rnas (circrnas) are highly abundant rnas generated mostly from exons of protein-coding genes.  exonic circular rnas (circrnas) are rna molecules that are covalently closed by back-splicing via canonical splicing machinery.  bioinformatic analysis revealed shared features of circularized exons, including long bordering introns that contained complementary alu repeats.  circular rnas with exonic sequences represent a special form of non-coding rnas, discovered by analyzing a handful of transcribed genes.  exonic circular rnas (circrnas) are a novel subgroup of non-coding rnas, which are generated by a back-splicing mechanism of the exons or introns.  circular rnas composed of exonic sequence have been described in a small number of genes.  circular rnas are an emerging class of transcript isoforms created by unique back splicing of exons to form a closed covalent circular structure.  circular rnas are produced from back-splicing of exons of precursor mrnas (pre-mrnas).  circle formation requires release of the 3' exon of a splicing substrate, apparently by a trans splicing mechanism. ||| ",yes
Is exonuclease Xrn1 a component of the P-bodies?,"the major cytoplasmic 5' to 3'-exoribonuclease activity is carried out by the xrn1 protein in eukaryotic cells.  the xrn family of 5'→3' exoribonucleases is critical for ensuring the fidelity of cellular rna turnover in eukaryotes.  in this chapter, we concentrate on methods used in our laboratory to analyze xrn1 5' to 3'-exoribonuclease activity.  we have proposed an additional role, that of a processivity factor, conferring a processive mechanism of action on xpf and xpg, the endonucleases, involved in ner.  the rnase p family comprises structurally diverse endoribonucleases ranging from complex ribonucleoproteins to single polypeptides.  during endoplasmic reticulum (er) stress, the endoribonuclease (rnase) ire1α initiates removal of a 26 nt region from the mrna encoding the transcription factor xbp1 via an unconventional mechanism (atypically within the cytosol).  xrns degrade diverse rna substrates during general rna decay and function in specialized processes integral to rna metabolism, such as nonsense-mediated decay (nmd), gene silencing, rrna maturation, and transcription termination.  xpa is a protein essential for nucleotide excision repair (ner) where it is thought to function in damage recognition/verification.  biochemical analysis of a polx(bs) deletion mutant lacking the c-terminal polymerase histidinol phosphatase (php) domain, present in most of the bacterial/archaeal polxs, as well as of this separately expressed protein region, allow us to state that the 3'-5' exonuclease activity of polx(bs) resides in its php domain.  the dead-box rna helicase prp5 is required for the formation of the prespliceosome through an atp-dependent function to remodel u2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles (snrnps) and an atp-independent function of unknown mechanism.  endonuclease xpg participates in nucleotide excision repair (ner), in basal transcription, and in the processing of rna/dna hybrids (r-loops): the malfunction of these processes may cause genome instability.  in addition, they contain sph-1, the xenopus homologue of p80-coilin, a protein characteristic of coiled bodies.  many bacterial polxs have a polymerase and histidinol phosphatase (php) domain at their c-termini in addition to a polx core (polxc) domain, and possess 3'-5' exonuclease activity.  our findings provide a molecular insight into the functional domain organization of bacterial polxs, especially the requirement of the php domain for 3'-5' exonuclease activity.  moreover, site-directed mutagenesis revealed catalytically important residues in the php domain for the 3'-5' exonuclease activity.  one example is the breakthrough in our understanding of how xrn1 processively degrades 5' monophosphorylated rna, revealed by its crystal structure and mutational analysis.  here, we review current knowledge of xrns, highlighting recent work of high impact and future potential.  excisionase (xis) is an accessory protein that is required for the excision of the related prophages lambda and hk022.  the polxc domain was responsible for the polymerase and dna-binding activities but exonuclease activity was not detected for either domain.  mutations in both the zinc finger motif and the large basic cleft in this domain eliminated the ability of xpa to confer a processive mechanism of action on the endonucleases involved in ner. ||| ",yes
Is factor XI deficient in Hemophilia C?,"inherited factor xi (fxi) deficiency, also called hemophilia c, is an uncommon autosomal recessive disorder, which is associated with a variable bleeding tendency that usually manifests after trauma or surgery.  factor xi deficiency is a rare hematologic disorder.  deficiency in coagulation factor ix, a plasma glycoprotein constituent of the clotting cascade, results in hemophilia b, an inherited recessive x-linked bleeding disorder.  hemophilia c (factor xi deficiency) affects both genders and it is usually asymptomatic, manifesting only as postoperative hemorrhage.  hemophilia a is an x-linked inherited bleeding disorder caused by deficiency of coagulation factor viii.  a deficiency of factor xi is associated with bleeding, but a role of high factor xi levels in thrombosis has not been investigated.  factor xi (fxi) deficiency is a rare autosomal bleeding disease associated with genetic defects in the fxi gene.  this brief review article summarizes the main features of coagulation factor xi and its deficiency and resumes the principle axes of research and methods used to investigate fxi functions.  factor xi deficiency is associated with a bleeding diathesis, but factor xii deficiency is not, indicating that, in normal hemostasis, factor xi must be activated in vivo by a protease other than factor xiia.  the objective of this report was to present the anesthetic protocol for patients with hemophilia c and to alert for the need of investigation in patients with a history of postoperative bleeding, when a coagulation study should e be done before any invasive procedure and, in the case of prolonged aptt, one should investigate the presence of factor xi deficiency.  hemophilia is caused by deficiencies in coagulation factor viii or ix, resulting in direct blockade of the intrinsic tenase complex and indirect blockade of the extrinsic tenase complex which is rapidly inhibited upon binding of factor xa to tissue factor pathway inhibitor.  the characterizations of the point mutations responsible for the majority of cases of severe factor xi deficiency in ashkenazi jews and subsequent epidemiologic studies have provided insight into the perplexing hemostatic abnormalities in this disorder.  haemophilia a is an x-linked bleeding disorder caused by a deficiency of factor viii.  factor xi is a key component of the intrinsic pathway of blood coagulation in vitro.  it appears that excessive bleeding in factor xi deficiency depends on the severity of the deficiency in certain situations and on the location of the hemostatic challenge in others.  the poor correlation between the clinical bleeding diathesis in factor xi deficiency and abnormalities in clotting assays that measure intrinsic coagulation brings into question the role of this serine protease in in vivo hemostasis.  factor ixchapel hill (factor ixch), an abnormal factor ix molecule isolated from the plasma of a patient with mild hemophilia b, has previously been shown to exhibit delayed activation by factor xia and calcium.  factor xi (fxi) is the zymogen of a serine protease enzyme in the intrinsic pathway of blood coagulation and is an important factor in the creation of a stable fibrin clot.  deficiency of fxi leads to an injury-related bleeding disorder and is remarkable for the lack of correlation between bleeding symptoms and fxi coagulant activity (fxi:c).  factor xi, a component of the intrinsic pathway of coagulation, contributes to the generation of thrombin, which is involved in both the formation of fibrin and protection against fibrinolysis. ||| ",yes
Is fatigue prevalent in patients receiving treatment for glioblastoma?,"our findings indicate that glioblastoma patients are frequently affected by fatigue at baseline, suggesting that factors other than those related to radio- or chemotherapy have significant impact, particularly depression and tumor localization.  fatigue is a consistently reported, severe symptom among patients with gliomas throughout the disease trajectory.  the aim of this study was to determine the prevalence and severity of fatigue in long-term survivors with a low-grade glioma (lgg), and to analyze the relationship between fatigue and demographic variables, disease duration, tumor characteristics, former tumor treatment modalities, antiepileptic drug (aed) use, self-reported concentration, motivation, and activity.  our findings indicate that fatigue is a common symptom in patients with diffuse glioma, both pre- and postoperatively.  the main goal of this study was to assess frequency, clinical correlates, and independent predictors of fatigue in a homogeneous cohort of well-defined glioblastoma patients at baseline prior to combined radio-chemotherapy.  fatigue is common among glioma patients undergoing radiotherapy (rt) and impacts quality of life (qol).  we prospectively included 65 glioblastoma patients at postsurgical baseline and assessed fatigue, sleepiness, mean bedtimes, mood disturbances, and clinical characteristics such as clinical performance status, presenting symptomatology, details on neurosurgical procedure, and tumor location and diameter as well as pharmacological treatment including antiepileptic drugs, antidepressants, and use of corticosteroids.  quality of life (qol) impairment and fatigue are frequently experienced during treatment for recurrent high-grade glioma (hgg).  the purpose of this study was to explore the prevalence of pre- and postoperative high fatigue, perioperative changes, and factors associated with pre- and postoperative high fatigue in patients undergoing primary surgery for diffuse glioma.  to evaluate changes in fatigue at the time of diagnosis (time 1) and two weeks after the completion of radiation therapy (time 2) and to determine the relationship between fatigue and quality of life (qol) at each time interval in patients with glioblastoma multiformae (gbm).  further studies are needed to determine whether pharmacologic treatment improves fatigue in glioma patients undergoing rt.  tiredness may be caused by the brain injury due to the tumor or the treatment in patients with glioblastoma multiforme (gbm).  to evaluate fatigue and cognitive functioning in patients with low-grade glioma and to assess whether cognitive functioning and employment status differ between patients with severe and non-severe mental fatigue.  only fatigue appeared to be more common in glioblastoma patients than in healthy controls (48% vs 11%; p < .001) but not the frequency of sleepiness (22% vs 19%; p = .43).  patients with low grade glioma show high rates of fatigue, especially in the mental domain, which might be associated with deficits in cognitive functioning and changes in employment status.implications for rehabilitationthe majority of patients with low grade glioma suffers from severe mental fatigue and has deficits in cognitive functioning, which may affect employment status.patients with low grade glioma should be screened for fatigue with the multidimensional fatigue inventory, to differentiate between mental and physical fatigue.patients with low grade glioma with severe mental fatigue should be screened for problems in cognitive functioning with an objective neuropsychological test battery.cognitive and vocational rehabilitation programs should aim at coping with severe mental fatigue and attention deficits in patients with low grade glioma.  fatigue is a common symptom in patients with brain tumors, but comprehensive studies on fatigue in patients with meningioma specifically are lacking.  in addition to neurologic symptoms, fatigue is commonly reported in patients with primary brain tumors during radiation therapy and in long-term survivors of low-grade brain tumors.  clinical factors (performance status, tumor details, age, gender) were collected by chart review on glioma patients with fatigue (""i have lack of energy"" on functional assessment of cancer therapy-brain), as well as available genotyping data.  cancer patients present a high degree of fatigue, which dramatically affects the quality of their everyday life.  fatigue is a common and distressing symptom in cancer patients which negatively affects patients' daily functioning and health-related quality of life. ||| ",yes

Is gastro esophageal reflux related to burning mouth syndrome?,"symptoms of reflux, such as heartburn, are due to a combination of factors: relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter, hypersecretion of gastric acid, and resulting burning of the esophageal mucosa.  gastroesophageal reflux disease (gerd) is associated with several symptoms, such as heartburn, belching, and regurgitation, which arise from esophageal exposure to gastric acid.  gastroesophageal reflux disease is a common disorder in which irritant gastric contents enter the esophagus, most commonly via transient lower esophageal sphincter relaxation.  the most common symptom of reflux esophagitis is heartburn.  reflux esophagitis, caused by mucosal exposure to the backflow of caustic gastric contents, is primarily a result of lower esophageal sphincter dysfunction.  gastroesophageal reflux disease is a very common condition that is usually manifested by heartburn or regurgitation.  reflux esophagitis is the subjective or objective response to gastroesophageal reflux (ger), which is defined as the entrance of gastroduodenal contents into the esophagus not associated with vomiting or belching.  the etiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of reflux esophagitis are reviewed.  gastroesophageal reflux disease (gerd) is a specific clinical entity defined by the occurrence of gastroesophageal reflux through the lower esophageal sphincter (les) into the esophagus or oropharynx to cause symptoms, injury to esophageal tissue, or both.  when the reflux is accompanied by inflammation of the oesophageal mucosa and extra-oesophageal symptoms the complaint is classified as a pathological condition called gastroesophageal reflux disease (gerd).  this report focuses on the manifestations of gastroesophageal reflux disease (gerd) that are caused directly by contact between refluxed gastric juice and the esophageal mucosa.  'gastro-esophageal reflux' is the passage of gastric content into the esophagus.  gastroesophageal reflux disease (gerd) is a gastrointestinal motility disorder that results from the reflux of stomach contents into the esophagus or oral cavity resulting in symptoms or complications.  gastroesophageal reflux disease (gerd), a condition wherein there is reflux of stomach contents into the esophagus, causing heartburn and regurgitation with a sour and bitter taste in the mouth.  gastro esophageal reflux disease (gerd) broadly includes the whole spectrum of reflux disease symptoms like heartburn or acid regurgitation to endoscopic, reflux esophagitis or barrett's esophagus.  gastroesophageal reflux disease, or gerd, is a relatively common condition, in which stomach acid may be refluxed up through the esophagus and into the oral cavity, resulting in enamel erosion.  gastroesophageal reflux (ger) is a dysfunction of the distal esophagus causing movement of stomach contents into the esophagus.  reflux esophagitis is a subset of gerd and implies the presence of esophageal inflammation, ie, esophageal erosions that are visible endoscopically, or nonerosive inflammation that can be documented by biopsies.  gastro-esophageal reflux (ger), the retrograde flow of gastric contents into the esophagus is a physiologic phenomenon, which can evoke symptoms and/or lesions in the esophagus (=gastro-esophageal reflux disease or gerd).  gastroesophageal reflux (ger) is the intermittent or permanent passage of stomach content into the esophagus and gastroesophageal reflux disease (gerd) is the reflux which triggers a whole set of symptoms or complications. ||| ",no

Is hydroxyurea usually used to treated infectious disease?,"hydroxyurea (hu, nh(2)conhoh), or hydroxycarbamide, is a hydroxamic acid derivative used as a drug for anti-neoplasm and sickle-cell disease.  hydroxyurea is an old drug that is often used to control essential thrombocythemia and polycythemia vera in patients with high-risk disease.  hydroxyurea is a drug widely used to control myeloproliferative disorders, due in part to its relative lack of severe side effects.  hydroxyurea (hu), an fda-approved drug for treating sickle cell disease, is used as an antitumor drug alone and together with conventional chemotherapeutics or radiation therapy.  hydroxyurea (hu) is a well-known chemotherapeutic agent that has been used largely for the treatment of various myeloproliferative conditions over the past 20 years.  hydroxyurea (hu) is a low-cost, low-toxicity drug that is often used in diseases, such as sickle cell anemia and different types of cancer.  hydroxyurea is the only currently available disease-modifying therapy for sca, and is emerging as a safe and effective treatment for all patients with sca, in both developed and developing countries.  hydroxyurea (hu) is generally regarded as an effective and well-tolerated drug for the treatment of the chronic myeloproliferative syndromes.  hydroxyurea is a cytotoxic and myelosuppressive drug that has been used during recent years in the treatment of children with severe sickle cell disease.  a small molecule with many biological properties, hydroxyurea is used in a number of myeloproliferative, neoplastic, and non-hematological diseases.  the aim of current study is to examine hydroxyurea (hu), which is an antineoplastic drug used for the treatment of leukemia, sickle-cell disease, hiv, psoriasis, thrombocythemia, and various neoplastic diseases in two aspects.  as countries in africa develop newborn screening programs to identify sca, the widespread use of hydroxyurea may prove to be a useful treatment to help ameliorate the disease in resource-limited settings.  hydroxyurea (hu) is a drug that targets the underlying pathophysiology of sickle cell disease (scd); however, it continues to be an underutilized treatment for adults.  hydroxyurea (hu), or hydroxycarbamide, is used for the treatment of some myeloproliferative and neoplastic diseases, and is currently the only drug approved by the fda for use in sickle cell disease (scd).  although the efficacy of hydroxyurea (hu) in inhibiting erythrocyte sickling has been well demonstrated, the action of this drug on human neutrophils and the mechanism by which it improves the manifestations of the disease have not been studied thoroughly.  this study looked at the knowledge, attitude and use of hydroxyurea in a low resource country with a high burden of the disease.  hydroxyurea (hydroxycarbamide; hu) is commonly used for the long-term treatment of patients with philadelphia-chromosome negative chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms (mpns).  hydroxyurea is increasingly being used to control myeloproliferative disorders, in part because of its relative lack of side effects.  hydroxyurea has documented laboratory efficacy with increases in hb and hbf; treatment also significantly reduces the number of painful episodes, acute chest syndrome, transfusions, and hospitalizations.  taken together, available evidence suggests that hydroxyurea represents an inexpensive and effective treatment option that should be offered to most, if not all, patients with sca. ||| ",no
Is hypersensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents a hallmark of Fanconi anemia?,"at the cellular level, hypersensitivity to dna interstrand crosslinks is the defining feature in fanconi anemia.  cells from individuals with the cancer-prone, inherited disorder fanconi anemia (fa) are hypersensitive to dna interstrand cross-linking agents and this hypersensitivity correlates with a defect in ability to repair this type of damage to their dna.  cells from patients wtih fanconi's anemia are unusually sensitive to agents which are capable of crosslinking dna.  fanconi anemia (fa) is a human genetic disorder characterized by hypersensitivity to dna crosslinking agents.  fanconi anemia (fa) is characterized by cellular hypersensitivity to dna crosslinking agents, but how the fanconi pathway protects cells from dna crosslinks and whether fa proteins act directly on crosslinks remain unclear.  fanconi anemia is characterized by hypersensitivity to dna interstrand crosslinks (icls) and susceptibility to tumor formation.  fanconi anemia (fa) is a cancer-susceptibility syndrome characterized by cellular sensitivity to dna inter-strand cross-link (icl)-inducing agents.  fanconi anemia (fa) is a cancer-predisposition syndrome characterized by hypersensitivity to interstrand-cross-link (icl) inducers.  an elevated frequency of chromosome aberrations, which is further exaggerated by exposure of cells to dna crosslinking agents, is a general feature of fanconi's anemia.  features of chromosomal aberrations, hypersensitivity to dna crosslinking agents, and predisposition to malignancy have suggested a fundamental anomaly of dna repair in fanconi anemia.  fanconi anemia (fa) is a genetic disorder characterized by bone marrow failure, congenital abnormalities, cancer susceptibility, and a marked cellular hypersensitivity to dna interstrand cross-linking agents, which correlates with a defect in ability to repair this type of damage.  the hypersensitivity of fanconi anemia, complementation group a, (fa-a) cells to agents which produce dna interstrand cross-links correlates with a defect in their ability to repair this type of damage.  fanconi anemia is a hereditary cancer susceptibility disorder characterized at the cellular level by spontaneous chromosomal instability and specific hypersensitivity to dna cross-linking agents such as mitomycin c. this phenotype suggests a possible role for the fanconi anemia proteins in the repair of dna lesions induced by these agents, but the molecular mechanism underlying the defect in this disorder has not yet been identified.  fanconi anemia (fa) is a recessive cancer prone syndrome featuring bone marrow failure and hypersensitivity to dna interstrand crosslinks (icls) and, to a milder extension, to ionizing radiation and oxidative stress.  the fanconi anemia proteins participate in a canonical pathway that repairs cross-linking agent-induced dna damage.  conversely, hyperactivation of the fanconi anemia pathway is a mechanism that may underlie cellular resistance to dna icl agents.  fanconi anemia pathway-deficient cells are hypersensitive to dna icl-inducing drugs such as cisplatin.  it is well known that fanconi anemia (fa) patients show a hypersensitivity to the effect of cross-linking agents such as mitomycin c (mmc) and diepoxybutane (deb), while the sensitivity of these patients to ionizing radiation is still controversial.  the fanconi anemia pathway is required for repair of dna interstrand cross-links (icl).  cells with inactivated fanconi anemia genes are universally hypersensitive to such agents. ||| ",yes
Is imatinib an antidepressant drug?,"imipramine, an fda-approved tricyclic antidepressant, has been commonly used to relieve depressive symptoms in the clinic.  imipramine (imi) is a tricyclic synthetic antidepressant that is used to treat chronic psychiatric disorders, including depression and neuropathic pain.  imipramine is a tricyclic medication that has been used for the treatment of depression and other mood disorders.  milnacipran, a dual serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (snri), is one of the antidepressant drugs that clinicians use for routine depression care.  major depression is accompanied by an activation of the inflammatory response system (irs) and antidepressants may have immunoregulatory activities.  imatinib, but not sunitinib, also stimulated irs-1(tyr612), akt(ser473) and akt(thr308) phosphorylation.  selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are frequently used antidepressants.  overall, our study explored the negative correlation between the use of antidepressants and prostate cancer progression, showing that imi attenuated cell viability, migration, and invasion of pc-3 cells by suppressing the expression of akt and nf-κb-related signaling proteins and secretion of tumor necrosis factor-α (tnf-α), interleukin-1β (il-1β), and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (mcp-1).  although pharmacological and psychological interventions are both effective for major depression, antidepressant drugs are frequently used as first-line treatment in primary and secondary care settings.  although imipramine is thought to prevent the reuptake of synaptic serotonin and norepinephrine, its antidepressant-like mechanisms remain elusive.  major depressive disorder is a debilitating illness, which is most commonly treated with antidepressant drugs.  tricyclic antidepressants and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are the cornerstones of drug therapy.  the efficacy of antidepressants in irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) is controversial.  the relationship of plasma imipramine and desipramine to clinical improvement in this group of secondary depressions did not parallel previously reported relationships of these antidepressant molecules to clinical outcome in primary depressions.  anti-depressants have been reported to own anti-tumor potential types of cancers; however, the role of imipramine in non-small cell lung cancer (nsclc) has not been elucidated.  major depressive disorder (mdd) is a leading cause of disability worldwide, with a poorly known pathophysiology and sub-optimal treatment, based on serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-ht) reuptake inhibitors.  little additional anticholinergic impact of the imipramine was observable beyond that already attributable to the benztropine, and no significant relationships were found between a clinical measure of peripheral anticholinergic activity and either global clinical outcome or antidepressive efficacy.  interleukin (il)-2, a t-cell cytokine used to treat malignant melanoma, can induce profound depression.  the purpose of the present study is to compare the efficacy of imipramine in the treatment of psychotic versus nonpsychotic depression.  adjunctive imipramine has been found to be useful in the treatment of a substantial number of patients with syndromally defined post-psychotic depressions. ||| ",no
Is indicated the use of antioxidant supplements in patients at risk for coronary artery disease?,"do antioxidant vitamins, in regular food or as food supplements, protect against myocardial infarction and stroke?  clinical use of antioxidant vitamin supplementation may help to prevent coronary heart disease (chd).  there is some evidence that antioxidant therapy may be beneficial for the prevention of coronary heart disease.  this review summarizes the scientific evidence for a possible role of antioxidants in the prevention of coronary heart disease (chd).  in observational studies (case-control or cohort design), people with high intake of antioxidant vitamins by regular diet or as food supplements generally have a lower risk of myocardial infarction and stroke than people who are low-consumers of antioxidant vitamins.  antioxidant vitamins are thought to play a role in atherosclerosis.  foods rich in antioxidants have been associated with a reduced risk of myocardial infarction.  epidemiologic studies find lower chd morbidity and mortality in persons who consume larger quantities of antioxidants in foods or supplements.  in this study, we investigated the relationship between coronary artery disease (cad) and serum antioxidative status by measuring the total antioxidant status (tas).  recent clinical and experimental studies have suggested that antioxidant supplements might actually have harmful as well as beneficial effects in the setting of cardiovascular disease.  dietary antioxidants and folic acid may play a role in the pathophysiology of coronary disease and stroke.  we review patient-oriented evidence on the effectiveness of supplementation with antioxidants and/or folic acid in the prevention of myocardial infarction and stroke.  clinical trials indicate that supplementation with certain nutrients is beneficial in reducing the incidence of chd events.  in this systematic literature review on the effects of antioxidant vitamins in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disorders, studies with ischaemic heart disease, stroke or combined cardiovascular events as end-points have been included.  these findings support the hypothesis that dietary antioxidants protect from myocardial infarction and that this effect might be exerted through interactions between antioxidants.  epidemiologic studies have shown a correlation between antioxidant intake and coronary artery disease (cad); however, the results of clinical trials have been inconsistent.  dietary supplements, such as those rich in antioxidants, have the potential to improve markers of cardiovascular health, but little is known about the total effect of these supplements.  recent studies suggest that the judicious development of antioxidant agents may provide an effective approach to quench oxidative stress in tissues and improve cardiovascular health.  to assess the evidence of the effectiveness of vitamin supplementation, specifically vitamins a, c, and e; beta-carotene; folic acid; antioxidant combinations; and multivitamin supplements, in preventing cardiovascular disease.  chronic inflammation and increased oxidative stress significantly contribute in developing coronary artery disease (cad). ||| ",no

Is insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) able to affect tendon protein synthesis in classic Ehlers-Danlos syndrome patients?,"in conclusion, local igf-i stimulated tendon protein synthesis in both young and old men, despite lower systemic igf-i levels in the old group.  the purpose of this study was to investigate the in vivo igf-i stimulation of tendon protein synthesis in elderly compared with young men.  insulin-like growth factor i (igf-i) is known to exert an anabolic effect on tendon fibroblast production of collagen.  we investigated the influence of insulin-like growth factor i (igf-i) on tendon construct formation in 3d cell culture.  in animals insulin-like growth factor i (igf-i) stimulates collagen production by fibroblasts and is expressed in tendons together with its binding protein 4 (igfbp-4).  cell proliferation and collagen content of the igf-i treated tendons were increased compared to controls.  insulin-like growth factor i (igf-i) and its binding proteins (igfbps), which are known to stimulate collagen production in animal tendons, may regulate the translation of mechanical loading to collagen synthesis.  we suggest that the igf-i system could be involved in collagen synthesis in tendon in response to mechanical loading.  insulin-like growth factor-i (igf-i) is known to be an anabolic factor in tendon, and the systemic levels are reduced with aging.  recombinant human insulin-like growth factor-i stimulated matrix and dna synthesis of all tendon segments in a dose-dependent manner in intervals from 10 to 1,000 ng/ml.  this study describes the temporal expression of insulin-like growth factor-i (igf-i), transforming growth factor-beta1 (tgf-beta1), and collagen types i and iii in healing tendon lesions.  to determine if differences exist in sensitivity to growth factors that have the potential to influence tendon repair, we compared the effects of recombinant human insulin-like growth factor-i on various types of tendon segments.  we found that tendons injected with igf-i had significantly higher protein fsr compared with controls (old group: 0.018 ± 0.015 vs. 0.008 ± 0.008, young group: 0.016 ± 0.009 vs. 0.009 ± 0.006%/h, mean ± se, p < 0.01).  the present study adds support for the roles of igf-i and igfbp-4 in the regulation of tendon adaptive responses to mechanical loading.  we injected igf-i in the patellar tendons of young (n = 11, 20-30 yr of age) and old (n = 11, 66-75 yr of age) men, and the acute fractional synthesis rate (fsr) of tendon protein was measured with the stable isotope technique and compared with the contralateral side (injected with saline as control).  tendon tissue concentrations of igf-i were found to be 0.53 +/- 0.10 ng/g.  this study investigated the effects of intratendinous injection of igf-i on tendon healing in an equine model of flexor tendinitis.  healing may be improved through intratendinous injection of insulin-like growth factor-i (igf-i), which has been shown in vitro to stimulate mitogenesis and enhance tendon matrix production.  he treatment of overuse tendon injuries with exogenous growth factors such as insulin-like growth factor-i (igf-i) may facilitate an improved return to sustained athletic function.  the growth hormone/insulin-like growth factor-i (gh/igf-i) axis is an important stimulator of collagen synthesis in connective tissue, but the effect of chronically altered gh/igf-i levels on connective tissue of the muscle-tendon unit is not known. ||| ",yes
Is intense physical activity associated with longevity?,"in this study, the relationship between moderate physical activity and longevity was investigated, taking into account age, gender, smoking habits, cohabitation status, body mass index, leg strength and balance, education level and cognitive function.  endurance exercise, including high-intensity training to improve cardiorespiratory fitness promotes longevity and slows down aging.  in an aging society, however, active life expectancy and maintenance of independence may be as important as effects of regular exercise on longevity.  robust epidemiological evidence exists that lifelong regular exercise contributes to longevity.  high levels of physical activity seem to positively influence health and cognition across the lifespan.  physical activity is beneficial for healthy ageing.  indeed, there is evidence to suggest that increasing exercise intensity in older adults may be associated with greater reductions in the risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality.  older people who exercise regularly tent to be those at whom we marvel: they live longer, more vigorous, independent lives.  longitudinal mixed effects models were used to assess the effect of sport or exercise group membership on physical activity and longevity across a 14-year follow-up.  there is consolidated evidence that physical activity exerts beneficial effects on several chronic conditions and longevity, on the basis of its proposed biological effects, especially on lipid profiles.  objectives: moderate physical activity gains survival.  evidence, mainly from cross-sectional studies, suggests that physical activity is a potentially important modifiable factor associated with physical performance and strength in older age.  cox regression analyses were used to investigate the predictive value of physical activity on longevity.  to examine whether engaging in physical activity in the context of sport or exercise group membership can protect against age-related physical activity decline.  physical activity plays an important role for achieving healthy aging by promoting independence and increasing the quality of life.  performing three to five times the recommended physical activity minimum reaches the maximal longevity benefit, that can be achieved.  the quality of life in old age is crucially dependent upon the ability to pursue a variety of physical activities.  meeting the currently recommended amounts of leisure time physical aerobic activity of moderate intensity of at least 150 min/week provides most of the longevity benefit.  the aim of this review is to discuss recent findings regarding, which dose and type of physical activity promotes a long healthy life, free of disease.  regular physical activity relates to physical and mental functioning in older people, and promoting physical activity has the potential to substantially reduce functional decline and improve well-being. ||| ",yes
Is intraoperative radiotherapy used for treatment of glioblastoma?,"radiotherapy is the standard treatment of glioblastoma.  radiotherapy is frequently indicated to treat cerebral gliomas.  radiotherapy plays a major role in the management of high grade glioma.  the standard of care treatment for glioblastoma is surgical resection followed by radiotherapy to 60 gy with concurrent and adjuvant temozolomide with or without tumor-treating fields.  radiotherapy is among the commonly applied treatment options for glioma, which is one of the most common types of primary brain tumor.  intra-operative radiation therapy (iort) is gaining popularity as an adjuvant option to surgical resection, in treatment of glioblastoma multiforme (gbm) for increasing survival rate, which a highly aggressive cerebral tumor with poor prognosis.  three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy is the standard technique to treat glioblastoma.  the common treatment in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme is the ultimately radical surgical removal of the tumour combined with radiotherapy.  novel radiotherapy approaches, such as flash, represent promising advancements in radiotherapy for glioblastoma.  radiotherapy is frequently applied in the treatment of malignant gliomas, but it is unclear if radiotherapy exerts its effects via induction of apoptosis.  intensity modulated radiation therapy (imrt) is increasingly employed in glioblastoma (gbm) treatment.  the patients operated on for glioblastoma multiforme during the first 21 postoperative days were randomly assigned to the group treated with radiotherapy alone (involved-field radiotherapy in 2 gy fractions daily five times a week up to the total of 60 gy over 6 weeks of treatment) or to the group treated with radiotherapy and tmz, initially in the dose of 200 mg/m² during 5 postoperative days and after 23 days followed by 75 mg/m2 of body surface area daily, 7 days a week (from the first to the last day of radiotherapy).  recognition of the local nature of glioblastoma has generated an increasing interest in treatment using radioactive implants (interstitial brachytherapy).  current standard of treatment for newly diagnosed patients with glioblastoma (gbm) is surgical resection with adjuvant normofractionated radiotherapy (nfrt) combined with temozolomide (tmz) chemotherapy.  stereotactic hypofractionated radiotherapy is one option for recurrent high grade gliomas.  although there is still no standard treatment for recurrent glioblastoma multiforme (rgbm), re-irradiation could be a therapeutic option.  the current standard of care for newly diagnosed glioblastoma (gbm) is surgical resection, followed by radiation therapy (rt) with concurrent and adjuvant temozolomide chemotherapy (tmz-cht).  radiotherapy is usually recommended for patients with a primary malignant brain tumor.  an intraoperative remote afterloading endocurietherapy technique with high-activity 60co for the treatment of glioblastoma multiforme is described.  during the period from 1987 to 1997, 32 patients with malignant gliomas were treated with iort. ||| ",no
Is invasion and metastasis one of the hallmarks of cancer?,"invasion and metastasis are hallmarks of cancer.  a defining characteristic of cancer malignancy is invasion and metastasis.  invasion, or directed migration of tumor cells into adjacent tissues, is one of the hallmarks of cancer and the first step towards metastasis.  cancer invasion and metastasis is the most morbid aspect of cancer and is governed by different cellular mechanisms than those driving the deregulated growth of tumors.  the development of metastases is the major cause of death for cancer patients, however, the mechanisms of tumor invasion and acquisition of capability to metastasize remain unclear.  tumor invasion is paradigmatic of the complex interactions connecting a carcinoma with its environment, and a reflex of the cellular and molecular heterogeneity that defines the initiation of dissemination and metastasis.  invasion and metastasis, the hallmark of malignant tumor, is the main reason for the clinical death of most cancer patients.  tumor invasion and metastasis are complex, multi-step biochemical processes, which involve cell detachment, invasion, migration, intravasation and circulation, implantation, angiogenesis and proliferation.  invasion, the hallmark of malignancy, consists in the translocation of tumour cells from the initial neoplastic focus into neighbouring host tissues, and also allows tumour cells to penetrate vessel endothelium and enter the circulation to form distant metastasis.  although tumor invasion and metastasis are both classical hallmarks of cancer malignancy and the major causes of poor clinical outcomes among cancer patients, the underlying master regulators of invasion and metastasis remain largely unknown.  the ability to invade tissue is one of the hallmarks of cancer.  invasion of tissue by the cancer cells is one of the key components in the metastatic cascade, whereby cancer cells spread to distant parts of the host and initiate the growth of secondary tumours (metastases).  the mortality associated with cancer depends upon the ability of malignant cells to invade and metastasise into adjacent and distant regions.  cancer cell motility and invasion are crucial elements in the metastatic cascade and involve dramatic changes in cellular morphology that are associated with dynamic remodelling of the cytoskeleton.  cancer cell invasion takes place at the cancer-host interface and is a prerequisite for distant metastasis.  a better understanding of the complex processes involved in cancer invasion may ultimately lead to treatments being developed which can localise cancer and prevent metastasis.  metastasis is the hallmark of cancer that is responsible for the greatest number of cancer-related deaths.  metastasis, a leading contributor to the morbidity of cancer patients, occurs through a multi-step process: invasion, intravasation, extravasation, colonization, and metastatic tumor formation.  cancer invasion and metastasis are the leading causes of death.  the acquisition of invasive tumour cell behaviour is thought to be a cornerstone of the metastatic cascade. ||| ",yes
Is irritable bowel syndrome more common in women with endometriosis?,"irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) is also common in this setting, and it was speculated that the visceral hypersensitivity associated with this condition might be amplifying the symptoms of endometriosis.  both irritable bowel syndrome and endometriosis are common conditions, although symptomatic gastrointestinal endometriosis is extremely rare.  associations between endometriosis and irritable bowel syndrome (ibs), celiac disease, and various autoimmune diseases have been reported.  thus, this study found a higher prevalence of ibs in women with endometriosis compared to women without endometriosis.  the aim of this study was to compare the prevalence of ibs in women with endometriosis to the prevalence in women without endometriosis and to investigate if the prevalence of ibs was associated with bowel involved endometriosis.  gastrointestinal (gi) symptoms similar to irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) are often present in women with endometriosis and microscopic colitis (mc).  women with concurrent endometriosis and ibs report a unique symptom phenotype.  compared with the controls, women with endometriosis were 3.5 times more likely to have received a diagnosis of ibs (or 3.5 ).  to investigate whether the increased chances of having a diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) and pelvic inflammatory disease (pid) in women with endometriosis is due to misdiagnosis or co-morbidity.  the prevalence of ibs was higher in women with endometriosis compared to the women without endometriosis (or = 5.32 (ci: 2.88; 9.81)).  compared with controls, patients with minimal to mild and moderate to severe endometriosis had a higher prevalence of symptoms consistent with ibs (0% vs 65% and 50%, respectively, p<0.001) with significantly lower mean pain thresholds (39.5 mm hg (95% ci 36.0 to 43.0) vs 28.1 mm hg (95% ci 24.5 to 31.6), p=0.001 and 28.8 mm hg (95% ci 24.9 to 32.6), p=0.002) not explained by differences in rectal compliance.  women with endometriosis are more likely to be diagnosed with ibs and pid than controls, even after a definitive diagnosis of endometriosis has been reached.  cases were women with diagnoses of both endometriosis and ibd.  we report the case of a patient initially thought to have irritable bowel syndrome, in whom the diagnosis of endometriosis only became clear following a laparotomy for small bowel obstruction.  women presenting with pelvic endometriosis frequently report gastrointestinal complaints of increased intensity during menstruation, which are not necessarily linked to the infiltration of the disease into the rectal wall.  women with ibs experienced aggravated abdominal pain, diarrhea, bloating and flatulence, nausea and vomiting, the urgency to defecate, the sensation of incomplete evacuation and intestinal symptom's influence on daily life, and impaired psychological wellbeing, compared to women with endometriosis.  women with endometriosis are frequently misdiagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) for some time before a correct diagnosis is made.  in women presenting to gynaecological clinics with lower abdominal pain, the cause is frequently attributed to endometriosis irrespective of whether it is found to be minimal or extensive at laparoscopy.  intestinal endometriosis is typically asymptomatic; however, when symptoms occur, they can mimic those of irritable bowel syndrome.  inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) and endometriosis are immune-mediated chronic inflammatory disorders affecting young women. ||| ",yes
Is it feasible to determine the complete proteome of yeast?,"the subcellular localization of the entire proteome of an organism, the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae, has been revealed for the first time.  our approach is straightforward, easy to implement, and enables quantitative profiling and comparisons of hundreds of nearly complete yeast proteomes in only a few days.  the availability of an annotated genome sequence for the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae has made possible the proteome-scale study of protein function and protein-protein interactions.  we evaluate its capability by characterizing changes in the yeast proteome in response to environmental perturbations, identifying distinct responses to each of them and providing a comprehensive resource of these responses.  comprehensive analysis of protein-protein interactions is a challenging endeavor of functional proteomics and has been best explored in the budding yeast.  mass-spectrometry-based proteomics has allowed the identification of the entire protein complement of yeast and the close-to-complete set of proteins expressed in mammalian cell lines.  systematic and comprehensive approaches to the elucidation of yeast gene function are discussed and the prospects for the functional genomics of eukaryotic organisms evaluated.  the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae is a powerful model system for systems-wide biology screens and large-scale proteomics methods.  we have developed a novel strategy in yeast that directly combines genetics with proteomics in the same screen to assign function to proteins based on the observation of genetic perturbations of sentinel protein interactions (geppi).  however, it remains challenging to scale this technology for rapid and high-throughput analysis of the yeast proteome to investigate biological pathways on a global scale.  we describe a strategy to identify yeast homologs based on protein function itself.  although near-complete proteomes of log phase yeast have been measured, protein abundance in yeast is dynamic, particularly during the transition from log to stationary phase.  despite extensive large scale analyses of expression and protein-protein interactions (ppi) in the model organism saccharomyces cerevisiae, over a thousand yeast genes remain uncharacterized.  although developed in yeast, rapid whole-proteome-based readouts can serve as comprehensive systems-level assays in all cellular systems.  the ability to measure the abundance and visualize the localization of proteins across the yeast proteome has stimulated hypotheses on gene function and fueled discoveries.  in order to fully understand the relationship between yeast's genome and its physiology, the stockpiles of diverse biological data sets that describe its cellular components and phenotypic behavior must be integrated at the genome-scale.  studies of cell physiology and structure have identified many intriguing proteins that could be analyzed for function by using the power of yeast genetics.  the yeast protein interactome analysis was achieved first by using the yeast two-hybrid system in a proteome-wide scale and next by large-scale mass spectrometric analysis of affinity-purified protein complexes.  taken together, this study examines the function and capacity of yeast's metabolic machinery and shows that the phenotypic phase plane can be used to accurately predict metabolic phenotypes and to interpret experimental data in the context of a genome-scale model.  in prospect of these studies we have undertaken the construction of a yeast 2-d gel protein database that contains information on polypeptides of the yeast protein map. ||| ",yes
Is it feasible to obtain DNA read lengths that exceed 30 Kb?,"given the apparent limitation of double-stranded rna (dsrna) genomes to about 30 kb, together with the complexity of dna synthesis, it appears difficult for a dsrna genome to encode all the information required before the transition from an rna to a dna genome.  to date, detection platforms for most microarrays have relied on short (25 base) oligonucleotides synthesized in situ, or longer, highly variable length dnas from pcr amplification of cdna libraries.  though the advent of long-read sequencing technologies has led to a leap in contiguity of de novo genome assemblies, current reference genomes of higher organisms still do not provide unbroken sequences of complete chromosomes.  the efficiency was dependent upon the amount of input dna, and ranged from isolation of an exon for every 20 kb to an exon for every 80 kb of target genomic dna.  despite reads in excess of 30 000 base pairs, there are still repetitive structures that cannot be resolved by current state-of-the-art assemblers.  we show that long-read sequencing with a single oxford nanopore technologies promethion flow cell per individual achieves 30× human genome coverage and enables accurate assessment of tandem repeats including the 10,000-bp alzheimer's disease-associated abca7 vntr.  we present smurf-seq, a protocol to efficiently sequence short dna molecules on a long-read sequencer by randomly ligating them to form long molecules.  within minutes, duplexes that contain only repeats (30 bp) expand dramatically to several hundred base pairs long.  exons were isolated from target human or mouse genomic dna sources ranging from 30 kilobases (kb) to 3 megabases (mb) in complexity.  the next generation of genomics is now being driven by massively parallel sequencers that are effectively high definition genetic analyzers capable of sequencing an entire human genome 30-times over in approximately a week for several thousand us dollars.  technological advances have now made it possible to sequence dna rapidly and has resulted in public databases with over 30 billion nucleotides of known sequence.  applying smurf-seq using the oxford nanopore minion yields up to 30 fragments per read, providing an average of 6.2 and up to 7.5 million mappable fragments per run, increasing information throughput for read-counting applications.  dna molecules separated in this agarose exhibited electrophoretic mobilities up to 30% higher than similar separations in standard analytical grade agarose.  total dna digested with ecori and bamhi and hybridized with a probe containing the 3' end of the 28 s ribosomal rna coding region shows four major bands of 3.9 kb, 4.6 kb, 5.4 kb and 6.2 kb.  oligo(dt) molecules, 30 nucleotides in length, were chemically synthesized on an applied biosystems dna synthesizer.  technological limitations have hindered the large-scale genetic investigation of tandem repeats in disease.  to date, over 30 ancient genomes have been sequenced, moving from 0.7× coverage (mammoth) in 2008 to more than 50× coverage (neanderthal) in 2014.  in order to assess the feasibility of semi-automatic procedures for large genome sequencing, a fragment of 9.4 kb of escherichia coli chromosomal dna isolated at random was sequenced.  the human ribosomal non-transcribed spacers are 30 x 10(3) base-pairs (or 30 kb) in length with a limited length heterogeneity localized in a specific region downstream from the 3' end of the transcribed region.  technological innovations such as next generation sequencing and dna hybridisation enrichment have resulted in multi-fold increases in both the quantity of ancient dna sequence data and the time depth for dna retrieval. ||| ",no
Is it possible to detect survivin protein expression in normal human adult tissues?,"while the human survivin gene is highly expressed in the developing fetus, in adults its expression is restricted to highly proliferating normal tissues and neoplastic tumors tissues.  survivin is a protein that is highly expressed in many embryonic tissues, as well as most human tumors.  survivin expression in normal adult tissues has not been fully understood, although it is markedly lower than in cancer, where it is over-expressed.  survivin, a member of the inhibitor of apoptosis protein family, is expressed in most human cancers, but undetectable in normal differentiated adult tissue in vivo.  survivin protein levels were determined in human and murine cancer cell lines and in normal tissues of adult c57bl/6 mice by western blot analysis.  however, survivin expression has been detected in various human cancers and -correlations have been recognized between the level of expression of this gene in tumors and prognosis.  transfection experiments indicate that survivin protein expression in cancer tissue appears to be regulated, at least in part, transcriptionally.  we previously reported that survivin is expressed and growth factor regulated in normal adult cd34(+) cells.  expression of survivin, a member of the inhibitor of apoptosis protein family, is commonly detected in cancers but not in normal differentiated tissues.  to investigate survivin expression in normal, potentially malignant and cancerous oral mucosa.  these results indicated that analysis of the intracellular expression of survivin (particularly cytoplasmic expression) is a marker for predicting disease progression in the uterine cervix.  survivin is one of the apoptosis inhibitor genes and is rarely expressed in adult -tissues.  survivin protein was detected in all cancer cell lines examined but not in most normal adult mouse tissues.  survivin, an inhibitor of apoptotic protein, is over-expressed in many cancers but not in normal differentiated adult tissues.  under normal circumstances, survivin is expressed in embryonic and fetal tissues, but is completely downregulated in normal adult tissues.  survivin was detected by immunoblotting and real-time pcr.  expression levels of survivin were measured by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction.  survivin is a member of the family of apoptosis inhibitory proteins with increased expression level in most cancerous tissues.  patients with metastasis had high survivin mrna levels in initial biopsy specimens (p<0.01).  taken together, we demonstrate for the first time that survivin is expressed in primary human osteoblastic cells on the mrna and protein levels. ||| ",no
Is it possible to determine the proteome of a formalin fixed and paraffin embedded  (FFPE) tissue?,"the ability to investigate the proteome of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (ffpe) tissues can be considered a major recent achievement in the field of clinical proteomics.  formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (ffpe) tissues present a particular challenge for proteomic analysis.  qualitative proteome profiling of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (ffpe) tissue is advancing the field of clinical proteomics.  proteomic analysis of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (ffpe) tissue offers significant diagnostic utility but is complicated due to the high level of covalently crosslinked proteins arising from formalin fixation.  formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (ffpe) tissue specimens comprise a potentially valuable resource for retrospective biomarker discovery studies, and recent work indicates the feasibility of using shotgun proteomics to characterize ffpe tissue proteins.  formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (ffpe) tissue specimens represent a potentially valuable resource for protein biomarker investigations.  formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (ffpe) tissue is a rich source of clinically relevant material that can yield important translational biomarker discovery using proteomic analysis.  protein profiling of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (ffpe) tissues has enormous potential for the discovery and validation of disease biomarkers.  formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (ffpe) tissue specimens comprise a potentially valuable resource for both prospective and retrospective biomarker discovery.  proteomic analysis of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (ffpe) tissue would enable retrospective biomarker investigations of this vast archive of pathologically characterized clinical samples that exist worldwide.  clinical proteomics using a large archive of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (ffpe) tissue blocks has long been a challenge.  formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (ffpe) tissue has recently gained interest as an alternative to fresh/frozen tissue for retrospective protein biomarker discovery.  formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (ffpe) tissue has recently gained interest as an alternative to fresh/frozen tissue for retrospective protein biomarker discovery.  formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (ffpe) tissue is considered as an appropriate alternative to frozen/fresh tissue for proteomic analysis.  formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (ffpe) tissues are a valuable resource for retrospective clinical studies.  formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (ffpe) material presents a readily available resource in the study of various biomarkers.  formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (ffpe) tissue biospecimens are a valuable resource for molecular cancer research.  these ffpe tissues are, however, refractory to proteomic investigations utilizing many state of the art methodologies largely due to the high level of covalently cross-linked proteins arising from formalin fixation.  there exists a need for robust approaches for tandem mass spectrometry (ms/ms)-based identification of proteins in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (ffpe) material.  formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (ffpe) tissues are the primary and preferred medium for archiving patients' samples. ||| ",yes
Is it possible to purify pseudopodia to be used for proteomic analysis?,"we developed a novel application to conduct pseudopodia proteomics.  here we describe a method to biochemically purify the protruding pseudopodium from the cell body compartment using polycarbonate microporous filters.  however, it has been difficult to study pseudopodia formation because it has not been possible to purify this structure for biochemical analysis.  identification of pseudopodia proteins leads to a further understanding of malignant phenotypes of tumor cells and novel therapeutic strategies.  pseudopodia and cell bodies are then differentially scraped from the filter surface into lysis buffer for biochemical analysis.  this method will provide insights into the molecular details of pseudopodia and a further understanding of malignant phenotypes of tumor cells and novel therapeutic strategies.  in our application, tumor cells were placed on a fibronectin-coated porous membrane to form pseudopodia.  mass spectrometric protein identification revealed 46 pseudopodia-localizing proteins.  subcellular proteomics include, in its experimental workflow, steps aimed at purifying organelles.  the separation of pseudopodia and cell bodies was verified by electron microscopic examination of the respective platelet components.  pseudopodia are ventral actin-rich protrusions and play functional roles in cell migrations.  the methodology for producing pseudopodial preparations of platelets stimulated with thrombin, adp or calcium ionophore was established.  cells are cultured on top of 3.0-microm porous filters and allowed to extend pseudopodia through the small pores to the undersurface in response to a gradient of either chemokine or extracellular matrix (ecm) protein.  according to the motile potentials of the cells, the cells formed pseudopodial microprocesses in the pores.  using this method, it is possible to identify novel pseudopodium and cell body proteins as well as study the spatiotemporal organization of signaling processes that regulate pseudopodium formation and cell polarity.  proteins in whole cells and pseudopodia fractions were individually solubilized, labeled with a highly sensitive fluorescent dye, and separated using two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis.  to date, protrusion of pseudopodia has been considered to be primarily responsible for translocation of free-living amoebae and leukocytes of higher organisms.  platelet pseudopodia were compared to platelet cell bodies with respect to their lipid composition, fatty acid distribution and protein composition.  the localization of novel pseudopodia-localizing proteins such as rab1a, hsp90b, tdrd7, and vimentin was confirmed using immunohistochemical examinations.  the microscopic observations and the protein expression studies suggested that the laser treatment caused no apparent damages to pseudopodia. ||| ",yes
Is it possible to visualize subtahalamic nucleus by using transcranial ultrasound?,"while transcranial focused ultrasound is a very promising neuromodulation technique for its non-invasiveness and high spatial resolution, its application to the human deep brain regions such as the subthalamic nucleus (stn) is relatively new.  we could show that it is possible to visualize major brain landmarks including the ""butterfly shaped"" midbrain, basal cisterns, third and lateral ventricles in all animals by transcranial ultrasound.  in the search for a better preoperative knowledge of the position of probes and electrodes, we assessed the feasibility and the usefulness of transcranial sonography during surgery for the implantation of stimulation electrodes into the subthalamic nucleus (stn) of patients with parkinson's disease.  real time intraoperative sonography is a valuable tool for visualizing subcortical mass lesions.  transcranial sonography of the substantia nigra for diagnosing premotor stages of parkinson disease has been attracting increasing interest.  transcranial sonography (tcs) is a relatively new ultrasound modality which could display echogenicity of human brain tissue through the intact skull.  the results indicate that transcranial ultrasonography may represent an easy and cost-effective imaging technique for follow up of cystic lesions of the pineal gland, especially in patients unable to undergo mr imaging.  intraoperative ultrasonography is a potentially useful tool for the neurosurgeon faced with the task of finding and removing small subcortical brain tumors.  transcranial sonography is increasingly used to aid clinical diagnoses of movement disorders, for example, to identify an enlarged area of substantia nigra echogenicity in patients with parkinson's disease.  these findings confirm the feasibility of transcranial ultrasound to detect sn hyperechogenicity in mptp-treated rhesus monkeys and suggest that this animal model may provide a platform for understanding the pathophysiologic basis of nigral hyperechogenicity.  to assess the incidence of a hyperechogenic substantia nigra (sn) by transcranial sonography (tcs) in healthy people and to evaluate whether an enlarged hyperechogenic sn area is associated with functional impairment of the nigrostriatal system.  transcranial ultrasound is a useful tool for providing the evidences for the early diagnosis and differential diagnosis of parkinson disease (pd).  transcranial sonography may be applied to assess the basal ganglia nuclei and brain atrophy by the measurement of the width of the third ventricle.  transcranial sonography may be a suitable method of identifying persons at risk of nigrostriatal alterations, making possible the introduction of early neuroprotective therapy.  recent evidence indicates that transcranial ultrasound stimulation (tus) modulates sensorimotor cortex excitability.  transcranial sonography is easily feasible during stereotactic surgery.  transcranial sonography is a highly sensitive noninvasive sonographic method for detection of early and specific echogenic changes in basal ganglia of patients with some neurodegenerative diseases.  ultrasound intensity delivery at the stn by a simple single element transducer is possible and could be a promising alternative to complex multi-element phased arrays, or more general, to invasive or less focused (non-acoustic) neuromodulation techniques.  transcranial sonography is a valuable neuro imaging method for early and differential diagnosis and follow-up of patients with neurodegenerative and psychiatric diseases.  transcranial sonography showed substantia nigra hyperechogenicity as a typical echo feature in idiopathic parkinson disease and lenticular nucleus hyperechogenicity as a characteristic finding in atypical parkinsonian syndromes. ||| ",yes
Is it safe to take isotretinoin during pregnancy?,"in this study, we evaluated the fetal outcomes of pregnant women who had inadvertently been exposed to isotretinoin during or before pregnancy.  severe malformations have been documented in neonates whose mothers had taken isotretinoin during pregnancy.  methods: to review the use of isotretinoin during pregnancy, we carried out a comprehensive search of literature in google scholar, scopus and pubmed/medline from their inception until april 2015.  one woman, exposed to isotretinoin up to the fourth week of gestation, decided ongoing her pregnancy with no current drug-related complications.  this is the first study of the pharmacokinetics of isotretinoin in women of childbearing age (n = 11).  the teratogenic effects of isotretinoin can be avoided, and numerous recommendations and regulations are in force to minimize the risk of pregnancy during treatment.  the risk for potential isotretinoin-exposed pregnancy was 3.6 (95% ci 2.0-7.0) per 1000 treated women over the 5-year observation period.  we present a case of both-ear malformation in a newborn whose mother had taken isotretinoin for 2 years until one month prior to the time when she became pregnant.  isotretinoin (13-cis-retinoic acid, accutane) increases the risk of major congenital malformations in infants exposed to isotretinoin during pregnancy.  although many risk management programs worldwide have been used to prevent isotretinoin-related teratogenicity, the results of the present study showed that women became pregnant during isotretinoin intake and opted for pregnancy termination.  the main outcome was the proportion of women who used systemic isotretinoin and had a concomitant record of (hormonal or intrauterine) contraception use covering the isotretinoin treatment period when pregnancy is contraindicated.  reproductive-age women treated with isotretinoin require reliable contraception to prevent pregnancies impacted by teratogenic-effects.  we conducted an anonymous survey of women of childbearing potential taking isotretinoin for at least 2 months.  exposing to isotretinoin among pregnant women has still occurred due to detrimental adherence to risk reduction programs which resulted in live-born infants with different kinds of abnormalities.  to minimize fetal exposure to isotretinoin, the program requires that female patients capable of becoming pregnant use two forms of contraception or commit to abstinence while using this therapy.  pregnancy should be ruled out before isotretinoin is prescribed.  the clinical efficacy and tolerability of isotretinoin was investigated, and the correlation between these data and steady-state serum concentrations of isotretinoin was tested.  we enrolled healthy reproductive-age women initiating isotretinoin and using an etonogestrel implant.  before prescribing isotretinoin, physicians usually inquire about pregnancy and perform serologic tests including cholesterol, triglycerides, and liver enzymes.  to describe isotretinoin prescription patterns for women aged 15-45 years, assess the concomitancy of isotretinoin and contraceptive use, and determine the rate of potential isotretinoin-exposed pregnancies in estonia. ||| ",no
Is it safe to use Abatacept during pregnancy?,"we propose that the tnf antagonists, specifically etanercept, be used with caution in pregnant women.  which ones are safe to use during pregnancy, and which ones do we know enough about to tell whether they are safe or not?  with the possible exception of brompheniramine, the commonly used antihistamine drugs appear to be safe during pregnancy.  what are the risks for the baby when the mother uses adhd medications during pregnancy?  as is the case for other psychotropic medications, for ethical reasons, no prospective randomized placebo controlled trial to assess aripiprazole safety during pregnancy has ever been conducted.  determine the drug's safety in pregnant women in our setting and assess its effect on the foetus, drawing on the experience of several hospitals.  we undertook a literature review to document whether certain therapeutic measures could be considered safe during pregnancy in the allergic patient.  when completed, raapp will enable physicians to evaluate the safety of medications commonly used by allergists to treat allergy and asthma during pregnancy.  the use of azathioprine (aza) in the treatment of autoimmune diseases during pregnancy are believed to be relatively safe, particularly taking into account the potential risks for mother and fetus should the underlying disease become active due to withdrawal of this thiopurine.  the aim of this study was to perform a systematic literature search and review to critically evaluate the available data on the use of aripiprazole during pregnancy, peripartum and lactation.  antiepileptic drugs (aeds) are used by pregnant women to manage conditions such as epilepsy and bipolar disorder even though they pose a risk to the developing foetus.  asthma is commonly treated during pregnancy, yet data on the safety of asthma medicines used during pregnancy are sparse.  we describe a patient with psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis who took etanercept 50 mg subcutaneously (sq) twice weekly throughout her pregnancy.  tnf-a antagonists are presumed to be safe in pregnancy based on animal data.  however, essential evidence on the safety of aza use during pregnancy is lacking.  most headache medications should be avoided during pregnancy because of potential fetal risks.  the objectives of the present article are to report experience of anti-tnf-alpha use in pregnancy, and review the international literature.  anti-tumour necrosis factor (tnf)-alpha therapies are considered category b drugs for pregnancy.  available evidence for amphetamines suggests no increased risk of malformations with use of therapeutic doses, and inadvertent exposure during pregnancy is unlikely to be harmful.  intrauterine exposure to 6-tgn may be minimized by careful therapeutic drug monitoring of the mother during pregnancy. ||| ",no
Is lambrolizumab effective for treatment of patients with melanoma ?,"this study evaluates the efficacy of pembrolizumab for the treatment of advanced/metastatic melanoma.  pembrolizumab monotherapy is a valuable option for the treatment of advanced/metastatic melanoma patients.  we tested the anti-pd-1 antibody lambrolizumab (previously known as mk-3475) in patients with advanced melanoma.  in patients with advanced melanoma, including those who had had disease progression while they had been receiving ipilimumab, treatment with lambrolizumab resulted in a high rate of sustained tumor regression, with mainly grade 1 or 2 toxic effects.  introduction: ipilimumab is effective in the treatment of metastatic malignant melanoma, but few biomarkers reliably predict treatment response.  we here report on a case of successful treatment with ipilimumab in dacarbazine-resistant metastatic malignant melanoma, including a review of the literature on the long-term treatment results.  we administered lambrolizumab intravenously at a dose of 10 mg per kilogram of body weight every 2 or 3 weeks or 2 mg per kilogram every 3 weeks in patients with advanced melanoma, both those who had received prior treatment with the immune checkpoint inhibitor ipilimumab and those who had not.  methods: patients were treated with ipilimumab for metastatic malignant melanoma.  ipilimumab, a novel immunotherapy, is the first treatment shown to improve survival in patients with metastatic melanoma in large randomized controlled studies.  in the last few years, melanoma treatment has been revolutionized by the development of immune checkpoint-blocking antibodies or immune checkpoint inhibitors including ipilimumab, vemurafenib, dabrafenib, trametinib, nivolumab, and pembrolizumab.  ipilimumab is an approved immunotherapy that has shown an overall survival benefit in patients with cutaneous metastatic melanoma in two phase iii trials.  the literature search was conducted in electronic databases for studies that evaluated the efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab either alone or in combination with other treatments advanced/metastatic melanoma patients.  as results of registrational trials might not answer all questions regarding safety and efficacy of ipilimumab in patients with advanced melanoma seen in daily clinical practice, the dermatologic cooperative oncology group conducted a phase ii study to assess the efficacy and safety of ipilimumab in patients with different subtypes of metastatic melanoma.  sixty-seven patients with metastatic melanoma who received pembrolizumab treatment in the context of a phase 1 study were included and screened for the emergence of vitiligo.  our findings indicate that onset of vitiligo-like leukoderma during melanoma treatment could be a marker of favorable outcome in patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors.  although development of immune checkpoint inhibitors has revolutionized the treatment of metastatic melanoma, more than a half of treated patients experience disease progression during therapy.  talimogene laherparepvec (t-vec) has demonstrated efficacy for unresectable melanoma.  here we present data on patients with pretreated metastatic cutaneous, mucosal and occult melanoma who received up to four cycles of ipilimumab administered at a dose of 3 mg/kg in 3 week intervals.  objective tumor response with regard to the occurrence of vitiligo in patients receiving pembrolizumab therapy.  this vitiligo-like leukoderma can also appear in melanoma patients undergoing immune therapies such as immune checkpoint inhibitors. ||| ",yes
Is lenvatinib effective for renal cell carcinoma?,"further study of lenvatinib is warranted in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma.  lenvatinib plus everolimus is approved for the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma (rcc) after one prior vascular endothelial growth factor-targeted therapy.  here, we aimed to assess lenvatinib, everolimus, or their combination as second-line treatment in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma.  the fda has approved the combination of lenvatinib and everolimus to treat advanced or metastatic renal cell carcinoma.  lenvatinib plus everolimus and lenvatinib alone resulted in a progression-free survival benefit for patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma who have progressed after one previous vegf-targeted therapy.  lenvatinib, a multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor, was recently approved for hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc) treatment in japan; however, the association between proteinuria following lenvatinib administration in hcc patients and early mortality is unknown.  lenvatinib (a multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor) in combination with everolimus (an mtor inhibitor) is approved for the treatment of advanced rcc after one prior antiangiogenic therapy.  lenvatinib, a novel multitarget tyrosine kinase inhibitor (tki), represents a therapeutic option, in combination with mammalian target of rapamycin (mtor) inhibitor everolimus, for the treatment of metastatic rcc (mrcc).  lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab demonstrated promising antitumor activity in a phase i/ii trial of rcc.  phase i studies supported clinical activity of lenvatinib in mrcc.  lenvatinib plus everolimus showed promising anticancer activity in patients with advanced nccrcc with an orr of 26% and is worthy of further study.  single-agent lenvatinib significantly prolonged progression-free survival compared with everolimus alone (hr 0·61, 95% ci 0·38-0·98; p=0·048).  lenvatinib plus everolimus significantly prolonged progression-free survival compared with everolimus alone (median 14·6 months  vs 5·5 months ; hazard ratio  0·40, 95% ci 0·24-0·68; p=0·0005), but not compared with lenvatinib alone (7·4 months ; hr 0·66, 95% ci 0·30-1·10; p=0·12).  in patients with metastatic non-clear cell renal cell carcinoma, sunitinib improved progression-free survival compared with everolimus.  we aimed to compare the mtor inhibitor everolimus and the vegf receptor inhibitor sunitinib in patients with non-clear cell renal cell carcinoma.  renal cell carcinoma (rcc) is the most aggressive type of genitourinary cancer and is resistant to current therapies.  currently, metastatic renal cell carcinoma is treated with sequential single agents targeting vegf or mtor.  currently, lenvatinib plus everolimus has us food and drug administration approval for its use in mrcc after failure of previous treatment with tki.  two patients with nivolumab plus ipilimumab treatment response for metastatic renal cell carcinoma underwent cytoreductive nephrectomy and regional lymph node dissection.  in one, the combination of lenvatinib and pembrolizumab was superior to sunitinib and to lenvatinib plus everolimus in clear-cell rcc. ||| ",yes
Is lenvatinib effective for thyroid cancer?,"lenvatinib is effective in the treatment of rr thyroid carcinoma.  lenvatinib is an oral multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor that has an anticancer action in patients with differentiated thyroid cancer that is refractory to radioiodine.  to evaluate the efficacy of lenvatinib in the treatment of radioiodine-refractory thyroid carcinoma.  the efficacy of lenvatinib for advanced and progressive radioactive iodine refractory differentiated thyroid cancer is well established.  background: survival rates for anaplastic thyroid cancer (atc) have not improved in the past four decades; however, preliminary clinical data indicate that lenvatinib may provide efficacy benefits for patients with atc.  background: lenvatinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (tki) recently approved for treating radioactive iodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer, has been shown to delay disease progression and provide meaningful benefit for overall survival (os).  lenvatinib, a tyrosine-kinase inhibitor that targets vascular endothelial growth factor receptor, has recently been approved in japan for the treatment of patients with unresectable thyroid cancer including anaplastic thyroid cancer.  lenvatinib is a multi-kinase inhibitor for the treatment of rr thyroid carcinoma.  in the phase 3 study of (e7080) lenvatinib in differentiated cancer of the thyroid (select), lenvatinib significantly improved efficacy outcomes versus placebo in patients with radioiodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer (rr-dtc).  since 2015, the cancer treatment lenvatinib has been used for patients with advanced radioactive iodine- (rai-) refractory thyroid differentiated cancer; however, the drug's long-term effects have not been fully investigated.  background: in the study of (e7080) lenvatinib in differentiated cancer of the thyroid (select) phase 3 trial on advanced radioactive iodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer (rdtc), lenvatinib improved median progression-free survival over placebo by almost 15 months and induces an objective response rate of 64.8%, but adverse events occurred in almost all patients.  lenvatinib is one of the few options for patients with anaplastic thyroid cancer (atc).  among them, lenvatinib has a high response rate and has become the first-line drug for treating thyroid cancer.  purpose in the study of (e7080) lenvatinib in differentiated cancer of the thyroid (select), lenvatinib significantly prolonged progression-free survival (pfs) versus placebo in patients with radioiodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer (rr-dtc).  new insights in thyroid cancer biology propelled the development of targeted therapies as salvage treatment for radioiodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer (rr-dtc), and the tyrosine kinase inhibitor (tki) lenvatinib has recently become available as a new line of therapy for rr-dtc.  knowledge of the efficacy and safety of lenvatinib in patients with anaplastic thyroid cancer (atc) is limited.  subgroup analysis shows that lenvatinib is effective for all patients with rr thyroid carcinoma, regardless of age, histological subtypes, radiological subtypes and mutation status.  sorafenib and lenvatinib showed efficacy for patients with radioactive iodine (rai)-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer (dtc) in pivotal phase 3 clinical trials.  the following report describes the efficacy of lenvatinib administered through a nose-gastric tube (sng) in a patient affected with a poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma (pdtc) which determined a stenosis of the esophagus.  clinical data of all patients treated for a differentiated thyroid cancer with lenvatinib from april 2015 to september 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. ||| ",yes
Is long QT syndrome a cause for sudden cardiac death in athletes?,"long qt syndrome (lqts) is an inherited channelopathy which exposes athletes to a risk of sudden cardiac death.  long qt syndrome (lqts) is one of the most common cardiogenetic diseases that can lead to sudden cardiac death and is identified by qt interval prolongation on an ecg.  the congenital long qt syndrome (lqts) is caused by cardiac ion channel mutations, which predispose young individuals to sudden cardiac death often related to exercise.  the long qt syndrome (lqts) is an arrythmogenic disorder characterized by prolonged ventricular repolarization leading to torsade de pointes evident at electrocardiogram (ecg).  sudden cardiac death is the leading cause of death in athletes.  the aim of our study was to investigate whether qrs-st changes are markers of cardiac arrest (ca) of unexplained cause or sudden death in athletes.  sudden cardiac deaths in athletes are usually due to underlying cardiovascular disease.  sudden cardiac death (scd) is the leading cause of mortality in athletes during sport.  sudden cardiac death (scd) is the leading cause of mortality in athletes during sport.  sudden death in athletes can occur during sport activities and is presumably related to ventricular arrhythmias.  sudden death in athletes can occur during sport activities and is presumably related to ventricular arrhythmias.  sudden cardiac death  in competitive athletes is caused by a diverse set of cardiovascular diseases such as hypertrophic and dilated cardiomyopathy , myocarditis, coronary anomalies or even coronary artery disease.  sudden cardiac death in the young athlete is caused primarily by cardiomyopathies and nonatherosclerotic coronary artery abnormalities; in the mature athlete, the most prevalent cause of sudden cardiac death is atherosclerotic coronary disease.  sudden death in athletes occurs because of the existence of hidden cardiovascular disorders which, during effort, may jeopardize the electrical stability of the heart, triggering ventricular tachycardia and/or fibrillation.  sudden cardiac death in athletes is one of the most tragic health events seen both in our country and all over the world.  the issue of lqts and sports participation has received significant publicity due to reports of sudden death in young competitive athletes.  this article reviews causes of sudden cardiac death in young athletes and current recommendations for pre-participation screening.  this article reviews the pathophysiology, clinical characteristics, and management of lqts in the physically active and athletic population.  sudden cardiac death (scd) of young athletes is an unexpected and tragic event that could occur during sport activities and is frequently related to ventricular arrhythmias.  j wave and/or qrs slurring was found more frequently among athletes with cardiac arrest/sudden death than in control athletes. ||| ",yes
Is low T3 syndrome a prognostic marker in patients with renal insufficiency?,"background there are few data on the prevalence of low t3 (triiodothyronine) syndrome in patients with non-dialysis chronic kidney disease (ckd) and it is unclear whether low t3 can be used to predict the progression of ckd.  conclusions a high prevalence of low t3 syndrome was observed in ckd patients without dialysis, even in early stages (1 and 2).  low t3 syndrome is characterized by low serum triiodothyronine (t3) levels without elevation of thyroid-stimulating hormone (tsh) in patients without apparent thyroid disease, which is known to be associated with worse clinical outcomes in various populations including those with kidney failure.  the increasing prevalence of low t3 as ckd progresses indicates its value as a predictor of worsening ckd.  in patients with end-stage renal disease, low plasma triiodothyronine (t3) may be an unsuspected expression of the inflammatory state of these patients.  in conclusion, low t3 syndrome may be a good candidate for predicting prognosis in future clinical practice of cll.  low t3 levels are a prevalent condition among non-critically ill patients, and this condition is associated with poor clinical outcomes in this population.  the results showed that 37 (14.34%) patients had low t3 syndrome, which was significantly associated with unfavorable ttft and css in the propensity-matched cohort, and it was an independent prognostic indicator for both ttft and css.  to evaluate the prevalence and predictive value of low t3 levels on 30-day and 6-month mortality in non-critically ill patients.  low-t(3) syndrome is a predictor of poor outcome in patients with cardiac dysfunction.  we investigated the prognostic value of serum ft3 levels and also low-t3 syndrome on overall survival in a large cohort of hemodialysis (hd) patients with normal thyroid-stimulating hormone levels.  a correlation between low t3 and poor clinical outcomes in the intensive care unit is more established.  the relationship between t3 and hscrp suggests that inflammation might be involved in the low t3 syndrome in hemodialysis patients, but we did not find a significant correlation between t3 and hscrp levels in patients on peritoneal dialysis.  our preliminary data suggest that the low t3 state is a predictor of outcome in pulmonary patients with respiratory failure.  low t3 is related to increased early and late mortality in nste-acs patients.  in this study, we examined whether low free t3 (ft3) levels are independent predictor of cardiovascular disease (cvd) events in patients undergoing hemodialysis.  a direct association between low triiodothyronine (t3) syndrome and cardiovascular (cv) mortality has been reported in hemodialysis patients.  low t3 which is defined as decreased triiodothyronine (t3) and normal thyroid-stimulating hormone (tsh) and thyroxin (t4) levels is present in many acute diseases and is related to increased mortality.  low triiodothyronine (t3) state is associated with poor prognosis in critical acute and prolonged illness.  low t3 syndrome refers to a set of thyroid hormone metabolism alterations present in the disease state. ||| ",yes
Is low T3 syndrome related with high BNP in cardiac patients?,"ft3 and low-t3 syndrome are significantly related to nt-pro-bnp in patients with cardiovascular disease, but are predictors of mortality independently of nt-pro-bnp and other known cardiovascular risk parameters.  these results indicate that low t3 is associated with high plasma bnp levels rather than worsening of hemodynamics.  in absence of overt cardiovascular disease, patients with low t3 syndrome present an increased concentration of nt-probnp.  low-t3 syndrome is highly prevalent and independently prognostic in cardiovascular patients.  we examined the relationship between low triiodothyronine (t3) levels and heart failure status, including b-type natriuretic peptide (bnp) levels, in 625 patients with cardiovascular disorders who underwent cardiac catheterization.  low-t(3) syndrome is a predictor of poor outcome in patients with cardiac dysfunction.  treatment with t3 decreased serum bnp while increasing total t3 indicating an inverse correlation between these two biologic factors (r 2 = 0.676, p < 0.001).  ft3 (hr 0.58, 95%ci 0.34-0.98) and low-t3 syndrome (hr 3.0, 95%ci 1.4-6.3) were predictive for mortality after adjustment for nt-pro-bnp levels and other cardiovascular prognostic variables.  we demonstrated a significant relationship between high bnp and low serum ft3 levels, and this relationship remained significant in patients with normal bnp levels.  myocardial bnp mrna was increased 2.5-fold in hypo rats and its expression was decreased to normal values by 14 days of t3 treatment.  the clinical literature suggests that serum brain natriuretic peptide (bnp) levels are inversely associated with serum triiodo-l-thyronine (t3) levels.  a low t3 syndrome was described in patients with heart failure (hf), and it appears to be associated with adverse outcome, representing an independent predictor of mortality.  after adjustment for known confounders, nt-pro-bnp was significantly associated with ft3 and low-t3 syndrome.  the median nt-probnp concentration of patients with low t3 syndrome was significantly higher than in those with normal ft3 (370 vs. 120 pg/ml, p = 0.002).  myocardial bnp mrna was increased 5-fold in mi rats which was significantly decreased by t3 over 8 to 16 week treatment periods.  those patients with low cardiac output syndrome after surgery had significantly lower t3 concentrations than patients without this complication.  although a low triiodothyronine (t3) state is closely associated with heart failure (hf), it is uncertain whether total t3 levels on admission is correlated with the clinical outcomes of acute myocardial infarction (ami).  low triiodothyronine (t3) levels and subclinical myocardial injury may be associated with adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular (ccv) events in individuals without clinically apparent coronary heart disease (chd).  the postoperative period after cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (cpb) is associated with a low t3 syndrome, i.e.  these data suggest the importance of systemic factors, such as low t3 syndrome, in the development of adverse cardiac/ccv events beyond advancing clinical atherosclerotic coronary disease in patients with chest pain. ||| ",yes
Is lumican a secreted protein?,"in skin, lumican is present as a glycoprotein.  lumican is an extracellular matrix protein modified as a proteoglycan in some tissues.  lumican is a small leucine-rich proteoglycan (slrp) being known as a key regulator of collagen fibrillogenesis.  lumican (lum), a small leucine-rich proteoglycan, is a component of the extracellular matrix.  lumican was present in the human sclera as a 70- to 80-kda core protein with short unsulfated lactosaminoglycan side chains.  lumican is a small leucine-rich proteoglycan (slrp), which contributes to cell migration, proliferation, tissue hydration, and collagen fibrillogenesis.  lumican, a small leucine rich proteoglycan (slrp), is a component of extracellular matrix which also functions as a matrikine regulating multiple cell activities.  lumican is a member of the small leucine-rich proteoglycan family.  lumican belongs to the family of small leucine-rich repeat proteoglycans.  based on its immunoreactivity, the lumican protein was found to be localized in fibroblasts and stromal tissues of normal colorectal tissues, but not in colorectal epithelial cells.  lumican is a keratan sulfate proteoglycan originally identified in cornea, but present in a variety of connective tissues where it presumably regulates collagen fibril formation and organization.  lumican is a member of a small leucine-rich proteoglycan family and its overexpression in human breast cancer tissues is reported to influence the growth of cancer cells.  western blot analyses, immunohistochemistry, and immunoaffinity chromatography were used to detect and purify the lumican core protein from tissue extracts from human donors 6 to 89 years of age.  ht1080 fibrosarcoma cells stably transfected with the lumican cdna (ht1080/lum), which express endogenous mt1-mmp, secreted moderate levels of lumican; however, treatment of ht1080/lum cells with bb94 resulted in accumulation of lumican in culture medium.  lumican (lum), a small leucine-rich proteoglycan (slrp) family member, has multiple matricellular functions both as an extracellular matrix component and as a matrikine regulating cell proliferation, gene expression and wound healing.  a recent study has reported that lumican (lum) is expressed at a high level in the nucleus pulposus specimens from herniated lumbar disc, without description of the specific mechanism.  in addition, we believe that lumican sequestered in the pericellular matrix interacts with cell surface proteins for specific cellular functions.  pretreatment with anti-beta1 integrin receptor antibody revealed a decrease in the proteoglycan forms of lumican protein and an additional two bands at 50 and 37 kd, indicating glycoprotein and the core protein of lumican.  the expression of lumican has been correlated to the growth and metastasis of various malignancies; however, its exact role in tumorogenesis remains elusive.  reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis revealed lumican mrna and its protein expression in colo 205, dld-1, hct-15, sw 480 and widr colorectal cancer cell lines. ||| ",yes
Is macitentan an ET agonist?,"macitentan is a novel dual eta/etb receptor antagonist with enhanced tissue distribution and sustained receptor binding properties designed to achieve a more efficacious et receptor blockade.  this study investigated the effectiveness of macitentan, a dual et-1 receptor antagonist, in mm treatment, and the mechanisms underlying its activities.  macitentan is a novel dual endothelin (et)-1 receptor antagonist to be used in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension.  macitentan increased plasma et-1 concentrations at all doses tested and was well tolerated and elicited no serious adverse events.  plasma concentrations of macitentan, its active metabolite act-13277, and et-1 were evaluated.  multiple oral doses of 3, 10, and 30 mg of macitentan were well tolerated in healthy korean subjects, and its pharmacokinetics correlated positively with et-1 concentrations.  the add-on effect of macitentan on top of bosentan in two pathological models confirms that this novel compound can achieve a superior blockade of et receptors and provides evidence for greater maximal efficacy.  macitentan is an endothelin receptor antagonist commonly used in the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (pah).  macitentan is a newly approved endothelin receptor antagonist (era) for the long-term treatment of pah with superior receptor-binding properties and a longer duration of action compared to other available eras.  macitentan is a potent, orally active, non-peptide antagonist of endothelin receptors with tissue-targeting properties, currently undergoing clinical development for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension.  macitentan is a novel dual endothelin receptor antagonist for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (pah).  macitentan is a new non-selective endothelin-1 receptor antagonist under development for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension.  macitentan is the first endothelin receptor antagonist with demonstrated efficacy on morbidity and mortality in pulmonary arterial hypertension (pah) in the pivotal study seraphin.  macitentan displays higher efficacy, lesser adverse effects and drug interactions.  et-1 receptors targeting by macitentan represents an effective anti-proliferative and anti-angiogenic therapeutic approach in preclinical settings of mm.  a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple-ascending dose study was performed in 30 healthy male subjects receiving oral macitentan (3, 10, or 30 mg) or placebo once daily for 10 days.  the pharmacokinetics (pk) of macitentan and its active metabolite, act-132577, were characterized in a population model.  we therefore studied the potential of macitentan to inhibit and induce critical targets of drug metabolism and drug distribution (transporters) in vitro.  here, we review the effect on pah of macitentan compared to other endothelin receptor antagonists.  macitentan is an orphan drug for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (pah). ||| ",no
Is macroautophagy a selective degradation process?,"macroautophagy is the process of intracellular bulk protein degradation induced by nutrient starvation and is generally considered to be a nonselective degradation of cytosolic enzymes and organelles.  macroautophagy (henceforth referred to simply as autophagy) is a bulk degradation process involved in the clearance of long-lived proteins, protein complexes and organelles.  macroautophagy is a cellular degradation mechanism that involves the delivery of cytosolic components (macromolecules or organelles) by the autophagosome to the lysosome for degradation.  macroautophagy is a catabolic process by which the cell degrades cytoplasmic components through the lysosomal machinery.  macroautophagy is an intracellular degradation system in which autophagosomes and autolysosomes degrade the contents they contain in order to realize cell homeostasis and organelle renewal.  macroautophagy is an evolutionarily conserved lysosomal-dependent pathway of degradation of several cytoplasmic components, such as misfolded proteins or damaged organelles.  macroautophagy is a catabolic process through which redundant, aged, or damaged cellular structures are first enclosed within double-membrane vesicles (called autophagosomes), and thereafter degraded within lysosomes.  macroautophagy (hereafter referred to as autophagy) is a degradation system that delivers cytoplasmic materials to lysosomes via autophagosomes.  macroautophagy (autophagy) is an evolutionarily conserved and dynamic degradation/recycling pathway in which portions of the cytoplasm, such as dysfunctional proteins and surplus organelles, are engulfed by double-membrane bound vesicles through a lysosome-dependent process.  in eukaryotic cells, macroautophagy is a catabolic pathway implicated in the degradation of long-lived proteins and damaged organelles.  macroautophagy (hereafter referred to as autophagy) is an evolutionarily conserved intracellular catabolic transport route that generally allows the lysosomal degradation of cytoplasmic components, including bulk cytosol, protein aggregates, damaged or superfluous organelles and invading microbes.  macroautophagy (hereafter referred to as autophagy) is a catabolic membrane trafficking process that degrades a variety of cellular constituents and is associated with human diseases.  macroautophagy, or simply autophagy, is a degradative pathway that delivers cytoplasmic components, including cytosol and organelles, to the lysosome in double-membrane vesicles called autophagosomes.  macroautophagy (hereafter autophagy) is a highly conserved catabolic pathway, which mediates the delivery of unwanted cytoplasmic structures and organelles to lysosomes for degradation.  in eukaryotic cells, the macroautophagy pathway has been implicated in the degradation of long-lived proteins and damaged organelles.  macroautophagy (hereafter termed autophagy) is a cellular membrane-trafficking process that functions to deliver cytoplasmic constituents to lysosomes for degradation.  macroautophagy is a degradative pathway that sequesters and transports cytosolic cargo in autophagosomes to lysosomes, and its deterioration affects intracellular proteostasis.  while initially acknowledged as a rather unspecific bulk degradation process, growing lines of evidence indicate the selectivity of macroautophagy pathways in the removal of misfolded or aggregated proteins.  autophagy (macroautophagy) is often defined as a degradative process and a tributary of the lysosomal pathway.  although it has been demonstrated that macroautophagy can selectively degrade specific targets, its contribution to the basal turnover of cellular proteins had previously not been quantified on proteome-wide scales. ||| ",yes
Is marijuana use associated with increased risk for stroke?,"an association between marijuana use and stroke has been previously reported.  young adults with recent marijuana use showed 1.82× higher odds (adjusted odds ratio, 1.82 ) of stroke compared with nonusers, which further increased to 2.45× higher (adjusted odds ratio, 2.45 ) among frequent marijuana users (>10 days/month).  we aimed to examine the association between marijuana use (18-44 years) among young adults and stroke events.  in this paper, we shall review the literature linking cannabis use and stroke and possible mechanisms supporting this link.  conclusions- there may be a significantly higher odds of stroke in young marijuana users (18-44 years) as compared with nonusers with even greater odds among frequent users (>10 days/month).  causality of marijuana abuse with development of ischemic stroke has been indicated by numerous case reports and epidemiological studies.  stroke caused by the use of marijuana was investigated in a 23-year-old man and the importance of inquiry of drug abuse in case of stroke was emphasized.  we describe 2 cases that introduce a previously unreported association between synthetic cannabis use and ischemic stroke in young adults.  weighted logistic regression models were used to examine an association of recent marijuana use (within the last 30 days) and stroke in young adults (18-44 years) adjusting for patient demographics, risk behavior, and relevant comorbidities.  compared with nonusers, stroke odds were even higher among frequent marijuana users with concomitant combustible cigarette use (adjusted odds ratio, 3.12 ) and e-cigarette use (adjusted odds ratio, 2.63 ), respectively.  although marijuana is among the widely used narcotics in the world, stroke associated with the marijuana use is infrequently reported.  synthetic cannabis use is an important consideration in the investigation of stroke in young adults.  reported marijuana use was associated with higher risks for cerebrovascular accident and bleeding and a lower risk for acute kidney injury after pci.  cannabinoid use may cause ischemic stroke, especially in the younger age category.  ischemic stroke is associated with drug abuse and/or substance use, mainly cannabinoids and amphetamines, particularly in young patients.  we present three case reports of marijuana consumers who were admitted to our comprehensive stroke center due to ischemic stroke within 18-month period of our investigation.  while the mechanism of marijuana-associated stroke is unclear, the drug is known to cause hypotension and to impair peripheral vasomotor reflexes.  smoking marijuana is found to be associated with an increased risk of myocardial infarction (mi) immediately after its use.  the cause and effect association between cannabis use and stroke is not firmly established.  this study aims to add evidence regarding the impact marijuana use has on the prevalence of cardiovascular disease. ||| ",yes
Is metabolic syndrome related with cardiovascular disease?,"the metabolic syndrome, a clustering of disturbed glucose and insulin metabolism, obesity and abdominal fat distribution, dyslipidemia, and hypertension is associated with cardiovascular diseases.  the metabolic syndrome is associated with increased cardiovascular risk.  the metabolic syndrome (mets) is believed to be associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (cvd).  the metabolic syndrome, a concurrence of disturbed glucose and insulin metabolism, overweight and abdominal fat distribution, mild dyslipidemia, and hypertension, is associated with subsequent development of type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease (cvd).  the metabolic syndrome is a cluster of cardiovascular risk factors, including abdominal obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia and insulin resistance, associated with increased risk of cardiovascular diseases and all cause mortality.  metabolic syndrome, indicated by insulin resistance/hyperinsulinemia, obesity, central obesity, atherogenic dyslipidemia, and hypertension, contributes to atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.  metabolic syndrome refers to a constellation of risk factors for cardiovascular disease.  the subjects with metabolic syndrome are an increased risk for the development of diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease as well as an increased mortality for cardiovascular disease in all causes.  metabolic syndrome is associated with abdominal obesity, blood lipid disorders, inflammation, insulin resistance or full-blown diabetes, and increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease.  the presence of the metabolic syndrome has been positively correlated with the cardiovascular risk (or 1.29; 95% ci, 1.05-1.54, p=0.047).  the association of metabolic syndrome with coronary artery disease (cad) has been studied extensively.  the metabolic syndrome is associated with a high incidence of cardiovascular disease even when the abnormalities present in the syndrome are mild.  metabolic syndrome (mets) is proposed as a predictor for cardiovascular disease (cvd).  cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality are increased in men with the metabolic syndrome, even in the absence of baseline cvd and diabetes.  metabolic syndrome (coexisting visceral obesity, dyslipidemia, hyperglycemia, and hypertension) is a prominent risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, however, its effect on cardiac gene expression pattern is unclear.  metabolic syndrome is a cluster of risk factors leading to cardiometabolic diseases.  metabolic syndrome (metsyn) is an important risk factor for type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases (cvd).  a rapidly growing body of evidence demonstrates important associations between the metabolic syndrome, characterized by a cluster of risk factors or phenotypes that include dyslipidemia, central obesity, hypertension, and hyperinsulinemia, and both cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes.  the term metabolic syndrome or cardiometabolic syndrome describes the clustering of several cardiovascular and renal risk factors, including type 2 diabetes mellitus, central obesity, hypertension, and dyslipidemia.  the risk of developing cardiovascular disease has recently been associated with a set of metabolic and physiological risk factors that include abdominal obesity, atherogenic dyslipidemia, hypertension, and elevated plasma glucose. ||| ",yes
Is miR-126 involved in heart failure?,"the aim of this study was to investigate the role of mir-129-5p in chronic heart failure and the underlying mechanisms.  increasing evidence shows that mirnas play pivotal roles in cardiovascular diseases, including heart failure (hf).  microrna-24 (mir-24) plays an important role in heart failure by reducing the efficiency of myocardial excitation-contraction coupling.  aberrant expression of various mirna species has been implicated in numerous cardiac diseases, e.g., heart failure, hypertrophy, conduction disturbances, and arrhythmogenesis.  circulating mirna‑21 has potential to be a biomarker of heart failure.  the levels of mir-129-5p and hmgb1 in chronic heart failure patients (chf) and normal controls were examined by rt-qpcr and elisa.  the correlations between circulating mirna‑21 and diagnosis, severity, prognosis and re‑hospitalization rate of heart failure were evaluated using statistical analysis.  prolonged cardiac hypertrophy may lead to heart failure, but little is known about the role of mir-24 in cardiac hypertrophy.  as an endothelium-enriched microrna (mirna), mir-126 has been reported to serve as a potential biomarker of acute myocardial infarction.  in this study, we found that mir-96 is a negative regulator of cardiac hypertrophy.  mir-126 has been implicated in the processes of inflammation and angiogenesis.  the current study assessed circulating mirna‑21 as a viable indicator for diagnosis and prognosis of heart failure.  we observed that mir-124 was elevated in angii-induced hypertrophic cardiomyocytes.  cardiac hypertrophy is a crucial predictor of heart failure and is regulated by micrornas.  in conclusion, our study shows that inhibition of mir-124 effectively suppresses angii-induced myocardial hypertrophy, which is associated with attenuation of er stress.  therefore, our study aimed to determine the role of mir-124 in angiotensin ii(angii)-induced myocardial hypertrophy and the possible mechanism.  we aimed to identify the specific underlying mechanism of mir-320 in cardiac fibrosis and hypertrophic pathogenesis.  mirna-375-3p (mir-375-3p) was involved in cardiac dysfunction and cardiogenesis.  micrornas participate in the regulation of abnormal cardiomyocyte apoptosis and autophagy, which leads to heart failure (hf).  microrna 21 (mirna‑21) promotes the development of cardiac fibrosis, hypertrophy and heart failure. ||| ",yes
Is miR-21 related to carcinogenesis?,"microrna 21 (mir-21) has been implicated in various aspects of carcinogenesis.  microrna‑21 (mir‑21) has been identified as an oncogene and confirmed to serve an important role in carcinogenesis in various types of cancer.  mir-21, which is a putative tumor onco-mir and frequently overexpressed microrna in various tumors, has been linked to tumor progression through targeting of tumor-suppressor genes.  in the liver, mir-21 was reported to promote hepatic steatosis and inflammation, but whether mir-21 also drives hepatocarcinogenesis remains poorly investigated in vivo.  as an important oncogenic mirna, microrna-21 (mir-21) is associated with various malignant diseases.  microrna-21 (mir-21), as an oncomir, is overexpressed in all kinds of tumors and the role of mir-21 in carcinogenesis is elucidated in many cancers gradually.  microrna-21 (mir-21) has been demonstrated to play an important role in carcinogenesis; however, its mechanism of action in colorectal cancer (crc) has not been fully elucidated.  our results suggest that mir-21 may be involved in cervical squamous cell tumorigenesis.  these results suggest that mir-21 may play an oncogenic role in the cellular processes of cervical cancer and may serve as a target for effective therapies.  in this study, we analyzed the function of mir-21 in noncancer cells of the tumor microenvironment to further evaluate its contribution to tumor progression.  microrna-21 negatively regulates several targets, thereby affecting tumorigenesis.  in this study, we sought to determine whether mir-21 has any role on tumor progression of salivary adenoid cystic carcinoma (sacc) and the possible mechanisms.  mir-21 has been recognized as an ""onco-microrna"" with the activity of negatively modulating the expression of tumor-suppressor genes.  the aim of the present study was to explore the oncogenic function of mir-21 and its molecular mechanism in crc.  preliminary studies showed that mir-21 is overexpressed in some human cancers.  whether upregulation of mir-21 contributes to hepatic metabolic disorders and their progression towards cancer is unknown.  we report that the expression of mir-21 in cells of the tumor immune infiltrate, and in particular in macrophages, was responsible for promoting tumor growth.  over-expression of mir-21 promoted tumor growth in balb/c nude mice and suppressed tumor expression of sec23a.  in this study we investigated the role of mir-21 in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (escc), and its possible mechanism.  in escc, mir-21 expression may be involved in tumor growth and invasion. ||| ",yes
Is micro RNA 1 (miR-1) implicated in cardiac arrhythmias?,"a large number of studies have demonstrated that mirna-1(mir-1) is involved in the occurrence of arrhythmia in many myocardial pathological conditions by post-transcriptionally regulating a variety of ion channels and proteins related to cardiac electrical activity.  changes in abundance of muscle-specific microrna, mir-1, have been implicated in cardiac disease, including arrhythmia and heart failure.  we aim at emphasizing the relationship between mir-1 and ion channels and proteins involved in the process of arrhythmia.  the effect on the heart ex vivo was demonstrated through investigating arrhythmia-associated human single nucleotide polymorphisms with mir1-deficient mice.  background: micrornas (mirnas) have been emerged as important regulator in a multiple of cardiovascular disease, including arrhythmia, cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis, and myocardial infarction.  micrornas (mirs) play critical roles in regulation of numerous biological events, including cardiac electrophysiology and arrhythmia, through a canonical rna interference mechanism.  micrornas (mirnas) play key roles in cardiac development, and the expression of mirnas is altered in the diseased heart.  the critical role of micrornas (mirnas) in the global control of gene expression in the heart has recently been postulated; however, the mechanisms of mirna regulation in cardiac pathology are not clear.  micrornas (mirnas/mirs) such as mir-1, mir-133a, mir-133b, mir-135a, and mir-29b play a key role in many cardiac pathological remodeling processes, including apoptosis, fibrosis, and arrhythmias, after a myocardial infarction (mi).  micrornas (mirs) contribute to different aspects of cardiovascular pathology, among others cardiac hypertrophy and atrial fibrillation.  among them, the cardiac enriched microrna-1 (mir-1) has been extensively studied and proven to be detrimental to cardiac myocytes.  aberrant expression of various mirna species has been implicated in numerous cardiac diseases, e.g., heart failure, hypertrophy, conduction disturbances, and arrhythmogenesis.  microrna-1 (mir-1) is approved involved in cardiac hypertrophy, but the underlying molecular mechanisms of mir-1 in cardiac hypertrophy are not well elucidated.  recently, it has been recognized that changes in microribonucleic acid (mirna) expression may lead to cardiac dysfunction.  microrna (mirna/mir)‑122 has been reported to be related with heart diseases, however, the functional role of mir‑122 in atrial fibrillation is unclear.  in this study, we investigated mir-1 expression and its potential role in the mouse model of viral myocarditis (vmc).  mir-1, mir-133a, and mir-133b have the potential to become diagnostic biomarkers of arrhythmia in pediatric patients.  microrna-1 (mir-1) has been found in cardiac and skeletal tissues.  micrornas (mirnas) play essential roles in cardiogenesis.  these results indicate that mir-1 accelerates right atrial tachypacing-induced aerp shortening by targeting potassium channel genes, which further suggests that mir-1 plays an important role in the electrical remodeling of atrial fibrillation and exhibits significant clinical relevance as a potential therapeutic target for atrial fibrillation. ||| ",yes
Is microRNA(miRNA) 29 involved in post-ischemic cardiac remodeling?,"micrornas (mirnas) are implicated in the regulation of pathological and physiological processes in myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (mi/r).  micrornas (mirnas) have been reported to be implicated in the progression of cardiac fibrosis, but the functions and mechanisms of mir-30b-5p and mir-22-3p remain to be investigated.  microrna-29 (mir-29) is suggested to function as an anti-fibrotic factor with potential therapeutic effects on cardiac fibrosis.  the present study aimed to investigate the role and mechanism of mir-29b-3p in cardiac fibrosis after mi.  micrornas (mirnas) are critical regulatory factors in myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (i/r) injury.  micrornas (mirnas) play an important role in the pathogenesis of structural alterations of the failing heart through their ability to regulate negatively the expression levels of genes that govern the process of adaptive and maladaptive cardiac remodelling.  mirna-30c is differentially expressed in the heart during the progression towards heart failure and in vitro studies hint to its importance in cellular physiology.  microrna (mir) dysregulation in the myocardium has been implicated in cardiac remodeling after injury or stress.  it is concluded that mir-30e elevation alleviated cardiac function damage and promoted ventricular remodeling via sox9 repression.  circulating micrornas (mirnas) have been proposed as potential biomarkers for left ventricular remodeling in postinfarction heart failure (hf).  although few micrornas (mirnas) have been involved in the regulation of post-ischemic cardiac fibrosis, the exact effect and underlying mechanism of mirnas in cardiac fibrosis remains unclear.  here, we sought to investigate whether microrna-34 (mir-34) plays a role in the pathogenic development of myocardial fibrosis.  recently, the roles of micrornas (mirnas) in various cardiovascular diseases associated with cardiac fibrosis have been extensively investigated.  simultaneously, we observed that overexpression mir-29a mice inhibited but knockdown mir-29a mice increased cardiac cross-sectional area, indicating that mir-29a has an antagonistic effect on cardiac hypertrophy.  we thus establish an in vivo role for mirna-30c in cardiac physiology, particularly in mitochondrial function.  at present, studies have focused on micrornas (mirnas) in myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury (mi/ri).  in vivo, inhibition of mir-34a reduces the severity of experimental cardiac fibrosis in mice.  micrornas (mirnas) regulate many aspects of cellular function and their deregulation has been implicated in heart disease.  tgf-β1 increased mir-34a expression in cardiac fibroblasts.  as little is known about the in vivo function of mirna-30c in the heart, we generated transgenic mice that specifically overexpress mirna-30c in cardiomyocytes. ||| ",yes
Is microRNA(miRNA) 30 involved in post-ischemic cardiac remodeling?,"micrornas (mirnas) have been found to act as key regulators in the pathogenesis of myocardial ischemic-reperfusion (i/r) injury.  micrornas (mirnas) have been reported to be implicated in the progression of cardiac fibrosis, but the functions and mechanisms of mir-30b-5p and mir-22-3p remain to be investigated.  micrornas (mirnas) are implicated in the regulation of pathological and physiological processes in myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (mi/r).  micrornas (mirnas) play an important role in the pathogenesis of structural alterations of the failing heart through their ability to regulate negatively the expression levels of genes that govern the process of adaptive and maladaptive cardiac remodelling.  rationale: previous translational studies implicate plasma extracellular microrna-30d (mir-30d) as a biomarker in left ventricular (lv) remodeling and clinical outcome in heart failure (hf) patients, though precise mechanisms remain obscure.  micrornas (mirnas) are critical regulatory factors in myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (i/r) injury.  mirna-30c is differentially expressed in the heart during the progression towards heart failure and in vitro studies hint to its importance in cellular physiology.  in the chronic phase of ischemic remodeling, lower expression of mir-30d in the heart and plasma evs is associated with adverse remodeling in rodent models and human subjects, and is linked to whole blood expression of genes implicated in fibrosis and inflammation, consistent with observations in model systems.  mir-30e attenuated iso-induced cardiac dysfunction and cardiac fibrosis in a rat cardiac remodeling model.  it is concluded that mir-30e elevation alleviated cardiac function damage and promoted ventricular remodeling via sox9 repression.  we thus establish an in vivo role for mirna-30c in cardiac physiology, particularly in mitochondrial function.  the aim of the present study was to determine the cardioprotective mechanisms by which micro (mi)rna-30e protects the heart from myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury (mi/r) and to explore the signaling pathways that may confer protection for the heart and be potential therapeutic targets.  micrornas play important roles in regulation of the cardiovascular system.  mechanistically, mir-30e suppressed snai1/tgf-β pathway which was involved in iso-induced cardiac remodeling.  methods and results: in rat and mouse models of ischemic hf, we show that mir-30d gain of function (genetic, lentivirus or agomir-mediated) improves cardiac function, decreases myocardial fibrosis, and attenuates cardiomyocyte (cm) apoptosis.  although few micrornas (mirnas) have been involved in the regulation of post-ischemic cardiac fibrosis, the exact effect and underlying mechanism of mirnas in cardiac fibrosis remains unclear.  as little is known about the in vivo function of mirna-30c in the heart, we generated transgenic mice that specifically overexpress mirna-30c in cardiomyocytes.  at present, studies have focused on micrornas (mirnas) in myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury (mi/ri).  here, we sought to investigate whether microrna-34 (mir-34) plays a role in the pathogenic development of myocardial fibrosis.  functional studies elucidated that forced expression of mir-30c-5p in rats effectively reduced infarct area, cardiac apoptosis, oxidative stress and inflammation induced by myocardial i/r injury. ||| ",yes
Is mitofusin 2 a receptor for parkin?,"recent work demonstrates that a phosphorylated form of the mitochondrial fusion protein mitofusin 2 serves as a receptor for parkin translocation to damaged mitochondria.  more recent publications also described a link between parkin and mitophagy.  mitofusin (mfn)2 redundantly promotes mitochondrial outer membrane tethering and organelle fusion with mfn1, and uniquely functions as the mitochondrial receptor for parkin during pten-induced putative kinase 1 (pink1)-parkin-mediated mitophagy.  here, we show that parkin is selectively recruited to dysfunctional mitochondria with low membrane potential in mammalian cells.  phosphorylated mitofusin-2 (mfn2), a receptor of parkin rbr e3 ubiquitin-protein ligase (parkin), interacts with parkin to promote the ubiquitination of mitochondrial proteins; meanwhile, the mitophagy receptors optineurin (optn) and nuclear dot protein 52 (ndp52) are recruited to damaged mitochondria to promote mitophagy.  parkin was associated with mitochondrial transcription factor a (tfam) and enhanced tfam-mediated mitochondrial transcription.  although the role of parkin in neuron maintenance is unknown, recent work has linked parkin to the regulation of mitochondria.  parkin (park2), an e3 ubiquitin ligase, is critical to maintain mitochondrial function by regulating mitochondrial biogenesis and degradation (mitophagy), but recent evidence suggests the involvement of parkin in promoting inflammation.  parkin promotes cell survival by removing damaged mitochondria via mitophagy.  in the present study, we determined if parkin regulates airway mitochondrial dna (mtdna) release and inflammatory responses to type 2 cytokine interleukin (il)-13 and allergens.  parkin has been implicated in the regulation of mitophagy, a quality control process in which defective mitochondria are sequestered in autophagosomes and delivered to lysosomes for degradation.  parkin is an e3 ubiquitin ligase encoded by the park2 gene.  we describe a novel function of parkin, a ring protein, which is elaborately involved in mitochondrial biogenesis.  these results demonstrate that parkin plays a protective role in the maintenance of normal mitochondrial and contractile functions in skeletal muscles.  results of pharmacological treatments indicate that parkin was released from mitochondria when permeability transition pore was opened.  parkin is selectively recruited from the cytosol to damaged mitochondria to trigger their autophagy.  parkin is a cytosolic ubiquitin ligase that translocates to damaged mitochondria and promotes their degradation.  the protein parkin, encoded by the park2 gene, is vital for mitochondrial homeostasis, and although it has been implicated in parkinson's disease (pd), the disease mechanisms remain unclear.  overall, the results of the present study demonstrate that parkin plays a protective role in the maintenance of normal mitochondrial and contractile functions in normal skeletal muscles.  parkin, an e3 ubiquitin ligase encoded by the park2 gene, has been implicated in the regulation of mitophagy, a quality control process in which defective mitochondria are degraded. ||| ",yes
Is muscle lim protein (MLP) involved in cardiomyopathies?,"muscle lim protein (mlp) has been proposed to be a central player in the pathogenesis of heart muscle disease.  targeted disruption of muscle lim protein (mlp) has previously been shown to result in dilated cardiomyopathy with many of the clinical signs of heart failure, although the effects of mlp disruption on passive ventricular mechanics and myocyte architecture are not known.  muscle lim protein (mlp) has been suggested to be an important mediator of mechanical stress in cardiac tissue, but the role that it plays in skeletal muscle remains unclear.  muscle lim protein (mlp) may serve as a scaffold protein on the actin-based cytoskeleton, and mice deficient in this protein (mlpko) have been recently reported to develop dilated cardiomyopathy.  muscle lim protein (mlp, csrp3) is a key regulator of striated muscle function, and its mutations can lead to both hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (hcm) and dilated cardiomyopathy (dcm) in patients.  the cardiac lim domain protein mlp, a member of the cysteine-rich protein family, is an essential regulator of cardiac muscle development.  muscle lim protein (mlp) has emerged as a key regulator of striated muscle physiology and pathophysiology.  muscle lim protein (mlp) has emerged as a critical regulator of striated muscle physiology and pathophysiology.  mutations in the human mlp gene are associated with hypertrophic and dilated cardiomyopathy.  muscle lim protein (mlp) is a cytoskeletal lim-only protein expressed in striated muscle.  immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization confirmed the expression of mlp protein and mrna in human cardiomyocytes.  mutations in human mlp are associated with cardiomyopathy; however, the molecular mechanism by which mlp functions is not established.  we investigated whether altered mlp expression is significant for the pathogenesis of human heart failure.  the muscle lim protein (mlp) is a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling protein playing important roles in the regulation of myocyte remodeling and adaptation to hypertrophic stimuli.  mutations in cysteine and glycine-rich protein 3 (csrp3), the gene encoding mlp, have been directly associated with human cardiomyopathies, whereas aberrant expression patterns are reported in human cardiac and skeletal muscle diseases.  mutations in cysteine and glycine-rich protein 3 (csrp3), the gene encoding mlp, are causative of human cardiomyopathies, whereas altered expression patterns are observed in human failing heart and skeletal myopathies.  missense mutations in human mlp or its ablation in transgenic mice promotes cardiomyopathy and heart failure.  mice with a disruption of the mlp gene resemble the morphological and clinical picture of dilated cardiomyopathy and heart failure in humans.  mlp is therefore a candidate gene for heritable forms of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (hcm) and dcm in humans.  mlp has been proposed to be a key player in the stretch-sensing response, but the molecular mechanisms underlying its function in normal and diseased cardiac muscle have not been established. ||| ",yes
Is muscle regeneration possible in mdx mice with the use of induced mesenchymal stem cells?,"we show here that bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (bm-mscs) also facilitate muscle regeneration in duchenne muscular dystrophy (dmd) model mice.  unlike dmd, skeletal muscles of mdx mice undergo successful regeneration and do not show extensive fibrosis and functional impairment.  adequate mitogenic activity in cme from mdx muscles may be related to successful muscle regeneration in mdx mice.  here, we have tested the hypothesis that muscles of mdx mice regenerate better than those of nondystrophic animals.  in the present study, we report the purification of muscle-derived stem cells from the mdx mouse, an animal model for duchenne muscular dystrophy.  the mdx mouse, a genetic homologue of human duchenne muscular dystrophy (dmd), has been attributed with a greater regenerative capacity of its skeletal muscles.  muscle-derived stem cells (mdscs) isolated from murine skeletal tissue by the preplate method have displayed the capability to commit to the myogenic lineage and regenerate more efficiently than myoblasts in skeletal and cardiac muscle in murine duchenne muscular dystrophy mice (mdx).  mdx mouse, the animal model of duchenne muscular dystrophy, develops an x-linked recessive inflammatory myopathy with an apparent sustained capacity for muscle regeneration.  our research group has isolated populations of muscle-derived stem cells (mdscs) from the postnatal skeletal muscle of mice.  the x-linked dystrophic animal model, the mdx mouse, shows an extraordinary capacity for sustained muscle regeneration compared with x-linked dystrophic golden retriever dogs and humans with duchenne muscular dystrophy.  we used the mdx mouse model of duchenne muscular dystrophy to investigate the effect of the host satellite cell niche on the contribution of donor muscle stem cells (satellite cells) to muscle regeneration.  it is well established that the injection of normal myoblasts or of muscle-derived stem cells (mdscs) into the muscle of dystrophin-deficient mdx mice results in the incorporation of a number of donor myoblasts into the host muscle.  in the dystrophic (mdx) mouse, skeletal muscle undergoes cycles of degeneration and regeneration, and myogenic progenitors (satellite cells) show ongoing proliferation and differentiation at a time when counterpart cells in normal healthy muscle enter quiescence.  to test the hypothesis that muscles of mdx mice might have inherently superior muscle regeneration to that in nondystrophic animals, muscle regeneration in response to a crush injury was examined in mdx mice and in the nondystrophic, parental strain c57bl/10sn.  in comparison with satellite cells, mdscs display an improved transplantation capacity in dystrophic mdx muscle that we attribute to their ability to undergo long-term proliferation, self-renewal, and multipotent differentiation, including differentiation toward endothelial and neuronal lineages.  however, efficient regeneration does not occur without muscle-resident mesenchymal progenitor cells.  we have previously reported that cd34(+) cells purified from mouse fetal muscles can differentiate into skeletal muscle in vitro and in vivo when injected into muscle tissue of dystrophic mdx mice.  little difference in the regenerative capacity, either histologically or with respect to the timing of muscle precursor replication, was found between mdx mice and c57bl/10sn or other nondystrophic strains of mice.  intramuscular, and more importantly, intravenous injection of mc13 cells result in muscle regeneration and partial restoration of dystrophin in mdx mice.  mdx mice uniquely recover from degenerative dystrophic lesions by an intense myoproliferative (regenerative) response. ||| ",yes
Is myasthenia gravis associated with osteoporosis?,"this current study aimed to evaluate the frequency of low bone mass, osteopenia, and osteoporosis in patients with myasthenia gravis (mg) and to investigate the possible association between bone mineral density (bmd) and plasma levels of bone metabolism markers.  myasthenia gravis (mg) patients had low proximal hip bmd, which could be explained by reduced muscle strength, elevated bone resorption markers, vitamin d deficiency, and increased pth levels in those with mg compared to controls.  the prevalence of osteoporosis was found to be significantly higher in the myositis group (7% vs. 13.5%, p: 0.045), but the fracture prevalence was similar in the two groups (75% vs. 68%).  our findings suggest that inflammatory myopathies carry significantly elevated risks for osteoporosis and fractures.  the risk of osteoporosis is known in myopathies requiring long-term steroid treatment and pompe disease, but not in other hereditary myopathies or sporadic inclusion body myositis (sibm).  the prevalence of osteoporosis and risk of fractures is elevated in rheumatoid arthritis (ra), but we have limited information about the bone mineral density (bmd) and fracture risk in patients with inflammatory myopathies.  risk factors of osteoporosis, laboratory parameters of bone metabolism, frequency of falls and fractures, walking ability, and pain were surveyed using questionnaires in 89 patients with sibm and genetically confirmed myopathies facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (fshd), myotonic dystrophy types 1 and 2 (dm1, dm2), limb girdle muscular dystrophies (lgmd2a, lgmd2b, lgmd2i), matr3 myopathy, and oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (opmd).  osteoporosis is a common concomitant disease in patients with rheumatic diseases on glucocorticoid (gc) therapy.  osteoporosis is a degenerative bone disease that causes significant morbidity and mortality in multiple sclerosis (ms) patients; the pathogenesis of this disease being poorly understood in the context of ms. osteoporosis is seen more frequently in ms patients than in healthy controls matched for age and sex.  the number of prevalent fractures was significantly correlated to poorer physical function in both groups, and poorer health status in the myositis group, but not in the ra group.  patients with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (mgus) have increased rates of bone resorption, osteopenia, osteoporosis, and risk of fractures.  background glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis (giop) represents the most frequently seen type of secondary osteoporosis, a systemic skeleton disorder.  osteoporosis is regularly mentioned as a possible consequence of treatment with prolactin-increasing antipsychotic medications, but little is known about the prevalence and the degree of loss of bone mineral density in patients suffering from schizophrenia.  the prevalence of osteopenia and osteoporosis is higher amongst patients with multiple sclerosis in comparison with the general population.  low bone mass, vertebral osteopenia and fractures have been described in patients with ankylosing spondylitis (as), but the aetiology of this osteoporosis (op) remains unknown.  the risk for osteoporosis and reduced 25-oh d3 level seems to be increased in wheelchair-bound patients with myopathy but also in patients with dm1 and autosomal-recessive myopathies.  osteoporosis was demonstrated in 35.3% of the patients, osteopenia in 47.5%, and a normal bmd in 17.2%.  in female patients, a positive correlation between body mass index and bone mineral density was found.  osteoporosis (op) results in weak bone and can ultimately lead to fracture.  osteoporosis is an important risk factor for fragility fractures. ||| ",yes
Is nicotinamide effective for skin cancer prevention?,"recent studies have demonstrated the role of nicotinamide, in both topical and oral forms, as a chemopreventive agent against skin cancer.  preliminary human studies suggest that nicotinamide may help prevent skin cancers and enhance the regression of actinic keratoses.  nicotinamide has shown potential as a safe and effective intervention for the prevention of malignant and premalignant skin lesions.  nicotinamide has been shown to reduce keratinocyte carcinoma (kc) in high-risk patients in a randomized controlled trial setting.  murine studies have shown that nicotinamide is also able to protect against photocarcinogenesis .  recent studies have shown that nicotinamide, in both oral and topical forms, is able to prevent ultraviolet-induced immunosuppression in humans  and mice .  a recent clinical trial found a protective role of niacinamide, a derivative of niacin, against skin cancer recurrence.  nicotinamide, an amide form of vitamin b3, has shown the potential to treat a variety of dermatological conditions, including acne, rosacea, and atopic dermatitis.  given the high incidence of non-melanoma skin cancer (nmsc), a preventative intervention would be desirable.  76.9% of survey respondents recommend nicotinamide for kc prevention.  therefore, nicotinamide plays a significant role in supporting energy-dependent cellular processes, including dna repair.  we prospectively evaluated whether total, dietary and supplemental niacin intake was associated with skin cancer risk based on 72,308 women in the nurses' health study (1984-2010) and 41,808 men in the health professionals follow-up study (1986-2010).  nicotinic acetylcholine receptors exist in abundance in human skin, but it is unknown whether they exert an anti-inflammatory effect.  preincubation of human cells with nicotine completely inhibited ultraviolet light (uv)-induced apoptosis.  individuals who answered ""yes,"" ""maybe,"" or ""uncertain"" to having safety concerns over long-term nicotinamide use and individuals in practice for more than 10 years were less likely (odds ratio  0.30, 95% confidence interval  0.13-0.71 and or 0.20, 95% ci 0.05, 0.82, respectively) to have recommended nicotinamide to patients for kc prevention.  a number of studies performed since 1984 have indicated that nac has the potential to prevent cancer and other mutation-related diseases.  randomised controlled trials of nicotine preparations in those skin conditions that occur less often in smokers are necessary to establish the value of nicotine, if any, in the treatment of skin disease.  assessed the effects of 0.1% topical tretinoin on nmsc.  however, there is no epidemiologic study to assess the association between niacin intake and risk of skin cancer .  however, the safety of nrt is controversial because numerous preclinical studies have shown that nicotine enhances tumor cell growth in vitro and in vivo. ||| ",yes
Is nimodipine recommended for prevention of vasospasm in aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage patients?,"this study was designed to assess the effectiveness and safety of nimodipine in the prevention of cerebral vasospasm in aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage patients.  intra-arterial nimodipine is effective and safe for the treatment of symptomatic vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage.  a number of randomized studies have shown the efficacy of nimodipine, administered either orally or intravenously, for the prevention of vasospasm and its clinical consequences in patients with subarachnoid haemorrhage following rupture of an intracranial aneurysm.  nimodipine is the most frequently used drug for cerebral vasospasm management and is the only approved medication that has been demonstrated to reduce ischemic complications, infarct size and improve neurological outcome after aneurismal subarachnoid hemorrhage.  the efficacy of intra-arterial administration of nimodipine (ian) in patients with severe vasospasm after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (sah) remains unproved.  nimodipine has been used in adults to reduce the incidence of cerebral vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage and improve long-term outcomes.  the therapeutic efficacy of intravenous nimodipine to treat the syndrome of delayed ischemic deterioration or vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage caused by a ruptured aneurysm was investigated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter study.  oral nimodipine after subarachnoid hemorrhage in children does not eliminate vasospasm, rebleeding, or infarction and is associated with significant hypotension.  nimodipine is widely used in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage for the prevention and treatment of delayed ischaemic neurological deficits.  nimodipine is a ca2+-channel antagonist mainly used for the management of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (asah) to prevent cerebral vasospasms.  high-dose intravenous nicardipine has been shown to reduce the incidence of angiographic and symptomatic vasospasm in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (sah), but treatment may be complicated by side effects, including hypotension or pulmonary edema/azotemia.  nimodipine, a calcium channel blocking drug, is used in the treatment of cerebral arterial spasm after subarachnoid haemorrhage due to bleeding from an intracranial aneurysm.  nimodipine is commonly used to improve neurological outcomes after subarachnoid hemorrhage.  current guidelines recommend the administration of nimodipine for the prevention of delayed cerebral ischemia (dci) after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (asah).  oral nimodipine is used for prophylaxis and treatment of delayed cerebral ischemia in patients with aneurysmal or perimesencephalic subarachnoid hemorrhage (sah).  our purpose was to assess the efficacy of intra-arterial nimodipine, a calcium-channel blocker acting mainly on cerebral vessels, in preventing delayed neurologic deficits in patients with symptomatic vasospasm.  the calcium channel inhibitor nimodipine has been used for treatment of cerebral vasospasm.  cerebral vasospasm is a major cause of morbidity and mortality after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage.  cerebral vasospasm remains a major problem in patients recovering from aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage despite advances in medical, surgical, and endovascular care.  cerebral vasospasm remains an important cause of permanent neurological injury and death following aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage, despite the best current medical therapy. ||| ",yes
Is nintedanib effective for Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis?,"this article reviews new available evidence on the long-term efficacy and safety of nintedanib in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.  nintedanib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, is approved for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.  nintedanib is a multi-kinase inhibitor approved for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (ipf); however, its efficacy and safety for patients with ipf and restricted pulmonary function remain unclear.  nintedanib slows disease progression in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (ipf) by reducing decline in forced vital capacity (fvc).  the inpulsis-on trial demonstrated that nintedanib reduced decline in forced vital capacity (fvc) and low pulmonary function (%fvc < 50%) of patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (ipf).  nintedanib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that efficiently slows idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis progression and has an acceptable tolerability profile.  nintedanib reduces the rate of decline in forced vital capacity in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (ipf), other chronic fibrosing interstitial lung diseases (ilds) with a progressive phenotype and systemic sclerosis-associated ild (ssc-ild).  the tyrosine kinase inhibitor nintedanib reduces the rate of decline in forced vital capacity (fvc) in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (ipf), other chronic fibrosing interstitial lung diseases (ilds) with a progressive phenotype and systemic sclerosis-associated ild (ssc-ild).  several clinical trials of nintedanib in patients with ipf have reported its inhibitory effect on reduced lung function, incidence of acute exacerbation of ipf and worsened health-related quality of life.  oral nintedanib is marketed for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (ipf), systemic sclerosis-associated interstitial lung disease and chronic fibrosing interstitial lung diseases with a progressive phenotype.  nintedanib is a multi-target receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor that reduces the decline in forced vital capacity (fvc) and prevents acute exacerbations in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (ipf), which is a risk factor for lung cancer.  exploratory data suggest that in patients with ipf, 6 months' treatment with nintedanib was associated with a numerically smaller degree of fibrotic change in the lungs and reduced fvc decline versus placebo.  therefore, we studied the effects of nintedanib on fibroblasts isolated from the lungs of patients with ipf.  future directions of nintedanib use are represented by the treatment of progressive fibrosing interstitial lung disease other than ipf, ipf with advanced functional impairment, and lung fibrosis secondary to connective tissue diseases.  however, it remains unclear whether nintedanib is an effective treatment for lung cancer in patients with ipf.  we report a case of left ventricular dysfunction in a patient with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis treated with nintedanib, which recovered after cessation of nintedanib.  expert opinion: nintedanib has shown to be safe and effective in patients with ipf, with a favorable long-term safety profile.  in clinical trials, nintedanib slowed disease progression by reducing the rate of decline in forced vital capacity (fvc) in patients with ipf and mild or moderate lung function impairment.  areas covered: herein, the authors review the working mechanisms of nintedanib, its pharmacological profile, and its efficacy and safety for patients with ipf.  this case indicates the possibility of nintedanib monotherapy in suppressing lung cancer complicated by ipf. ||| ",yes
Is nivolumab used for treatment of Non–Small-Cell Lung Cancer?,"objective: nivolumab has been used for treating non-small cell lung cancer (nsclc) worldwide.  recent studies with nivolumab (a monoclonal antibody against programmed cell death 1  receptor) have shown promise non-small-cell lung cancer (nsclc) treatment.  nivolumab, a human monoclonal antibody against programmed death-1, is approved for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (nsclc).  nivolumab has been shown to be effective and safe in previously treated patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (nsclc).  nivolumab has a promising efficacy for patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (nsclc) as second-line or later treatment, and after radiotherapy as abscopal effect.  nivolumab, an anti-programmed death-1 (pd-1) antibody, is administered in patients with previously treated non-small cell lung cancer.  nivolumab is an immune checkpoint inhibitor for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (nsclc).  the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, efficacy, toxicity, and place in therapy of nivolumab, a novel immunotherapy agent for the treatment of advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (nsclc) of the squamous cell subtype are reviewed.  nivolumab, a monoclonal antibody to programmed cell death protein-1 (pd-1), has revolutionised the management of patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (nsclc).  nivolumab (opdivo) approval for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (nsclc) prompts recognition of its future use in various cancers.  nivolumab offers a superior survival benefit over docetaxel in patients with advanced, previously treated non-small-cell lung cancer (nsclc).  immunotherapy with the programmed death receptor-1 (pd-1) antibody nivolumab has changed the field of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (nsclc) treatment.  in patients with refractory or recurrent non-small-cell lung cancer (nsclc) after first line chemotherapy, phase iii trials showed superiority of nivolumab, an igg4 programmed death-1 immune-checkpoint-inhibitor antibody, over docetaxel.  nivolumab is a novel programmed cell death 1 (pd-1) immune checkpoint inhibitor indicated as a second-line treatment for patients with nsclc whose tumors exhibit squamous cell histology.  the preoperative nivolumab (opdivo) to evaluate pathologic response in patients with stage i non-small cell lung cancer: a phase 2 trial (potential) study is a multicentre phase ii trial investigating efficacy of preoperative nivolumab for clinical stage i patients at high risk of recurrence.  nivolumab (niv) was recently approved in several countries for patients with pretreated advanced nsclc.  nivolumab is a novel pd-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor that is effective for treating advanced squamous nsclc in patients previously treated with platinum-based doublet chemotherapy or alternative first-line agents.  in non-small cell lung cancer (nsclc), the first immune checkpoint inhibitor to be approved by the us food and drug administration was nivolumab, based on a survival advantage over docetaxel in recurrent squamous nsclc, a difficult-to-treat histology.  we thus conducted this meta-analysis to compare the relative efficacy of nivolumab vs docetaxel-based chemotherapy as a second-line treatment for previously treated advanced non-small cell lung cancer (nsclc).  we investigated the safety and efficacy of nivolumab by analyzing the response factor, adverse effects (ae), and the post-treatment condition of pretreated advanced or recurrent nsclc patients. ||| ",yes
Is nucleosome eviction ATP-dependent?,"physiologically spaced nucleosome formation in hela cell extracts is atp dependent.  atp-dependent nucleosome-remodeling enzymes and covalent modifiers of chromatin set the functional state of chromatin.  we have examined the requirement for atp in human (h) swi/snf-mediated alteration of nucleosome structure and facilitation of transcription factor binding to nucleosomal dna.  the alteration is stable upon removal of atp from the reaction or upon inhibition of activity by excess atpgammas, indicating that continued atp hydrolysis is not required to maintain the altered nucleosome structure.  the human swi/snf complex remodels nucleosome structure in an atp-dependent manner, although the nature of this change has not been determined.  this region is not protected prior to u2 addition, and rnase h targeting of the region within nuclear extract converts an atp-dependent substrate into an atp-independent one.  adenosine 5'-triphosphate (atp)-dependent chromatin remodeling enzymes play essential biological roles by mobilizing nucleosomal dna.  maximum atp hydrolysis which is necessary to increase the periodicity of nucleosomes from approximately 150 to approximately 185 bp, not only inhibits h1 and h3 phosphorylation but facilitates their dephosphorylation.  atp-dependent nucleosome remodeling and core histone tail modifications play important roles in chromatin function.  in summary, we postulate that dna unwinding and atp dephosphorylation are coupled in different ways, depending on whether the fibrous atpase or one of the globular atpases provides the catalytic agent.  purification and characterization of the nurd/mi-2 complex, which possesses both nucleosome remodeling and histone deacetylase activities, suggests that atp-dependent nucleosome remodeling and histone tail modification can be coupled.  incubation of the altered nucleosome with hswi/snf converts this structure back to a standard nucleosome in an atp-dependent process.  hswi/snf-mediated nucleosome alteration requires hydrolysis of atp or datp.  nuclear envelopes contain a nucleoside triphosphatase.  here we show that hswi/snf and atp generate an altered nucleosomal structure that is stable in the absence of swi/snf.  chromatin remodeling enzymes use the energy of atp hydrolysis to alter histone-dna contacts and regulate dna-based processes in eukaryotes.  our work suggests that iswi is a physiological target of parp and that poly-adp-ribosylation can be a new, important post-translational modification regulating the activity of atp-dependent nucleosome remodelers.  we found that the evolutionary conserved nucleosome-remodeling atpase iswi and the poly-adp-ribose polymerase parp genetically interact.  ntpdase (ec 3.6.1.5) is an enzyme that hydrolyzes extracellular nucleoside tri-and/ or diphosphates to form atp, which can serve as a substrate for ecto-5'- nucleotidase (ec 3.1.3.5), releasing adenosine, an inhibitor of platelet aggregation and an immunosuppressant agent.  the protein also acts as a dna-dependent atpase, the single strand form being the preferred cofactor. ||| ",yes
Is ocrelizumab effective for treatment of multiple sclerosis?,"pivotal clinical trials revealed good clinical efficiency of ocrelizumab while having a good safety profile in the management of multiple sclerosis (ms).  ocrelizumab, a humanized monoclonal anti-cd20 antibody, has shown pronounced effects in reduction of disease activity in multiple sclerosis (ms) patients and has recently been approved for the treatment of patients with relapsing ms (rms) and primary progressive ms (ppms).  pivotal trials showed good clinical efficiency of the monoclonal antibody ocrelizumab while being well tolerated and manageable in multiple sclerosis (ms).  ocrelizumab is an anti-cd20 monoclonal antibody that has been shown to reduce disability progression in primary progressive multiple sclerosis (ms).  pivotal trial have shown that patients with multiple sclerosis (ms) receiving ocrelizumab had better outcomes.  ocrelizumab, an anti-cd20 humanized monoclonal antibody, reduced disease progression in pivotal trials of patients with relapsing (opera i, opera ii) and primary progressive (oratorio) multiple sclerosis (ms).  to review the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and safety of ocrelizumab, a new b-cell-targeted therapy for multiple sclerosis (ms).  the aim of this study was to evaluate the preliminary safety profile and effectiveness of ocrelizumab treatment for multiple sclerosis (ms) in a real-world clinical setting.  ocrelizumab is a humanized monoclonal anti-cd20 antibody approved for treatment of relapsing-remitting and primary progressive multiple sclerosis (ms).  ocrelizumab is a humanized monoclonal anti-cd20 antibody approved for treatment of relapsing-remitting and primary progressive multiple sclerosis (ms).  real-world evidence regarding the effectiveness and safety of ocrelizumab for the treatment of multiple sclerosis (ms) is limited.  the aim of our study was to provide effectiveness and safety data of ocrelizumab treatment in patients with relapsing-remitting (rr-) and progressive multiple sclerosis (pms) and to evaluate clinical and immunological predictors of early treatment response.  ocrelizumab is a monoclonal anti-cd20 antibody approved for the treatment of both relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (rrms) and primary progressive multiple sclerosis (ppms).  recently, ocrelizumab (ocrevus®) was approved for the treatment of primary progressive multiple sclerosis (ppms) based on data from the oratorio clinical trial.  ocrelizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that selectively targets cd20-positive b cells and is indicated for treatment of patients with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (rms) or primary progressive multiple sclerosis (ppms).  the chords trial evaluated ocrelizumab (ocr) in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis who had a suboptimal response to previous disease-modifying treatment.  two phase iii trials evaluated the efficacy of ocrelizumab in patients with relapsing remitting ms, and individual and pooled analysis demonstrated a significant reduction in annualized relapse rate ( p < 0.001 pooled), disability progression at 12 weeks ( p < 0.001 pooled), and gadolinium-enhancing lesions on magnetic resonance imaging (mri; p < 0.001).  rituximab and ocrelizumab are anti-cd20 monoclonal antibodies that have shown a marked reduction in multiple sclerosis (ms) inflammatory activity.  ocrelizumab is an anti-cd20 monoclonal antibody for the treatment of multiple sclerosis (ms) that is closely related to rituximab.  in this post hoc exploratory analysis, we evaluated the efficacy of ocrelizumab on disability progression among a subgroup of patients with ms who had increased baseline disability levels (expanded disability status scale scores ≥4.0) in the pivotal trials. ||| ",yes
Is ocular melanosis a risk factor for uveal melanoma?,"ocular melanocytosis portends a higher risk of uveal melanoma.  excessive melanocytes in the uveal tract in odm may provide the biologic basis for susceptibility to the development of uveal melanoma.  eyes with melanoma and oculo(dermal) melanocytosis had a relative risk for metastasis 1.6 times greater compared with those with no melanocytosis (p < .001).  uveal melanoma is the most common ocular melanoma and carries a serious prognosis, especially if the tumor is medium or large in size.  conclusions and relevance patients with uveal melanoma associated with oculo(dermal) melanocytosis have double the risk for metastasis compared with those with no melanocytosis.  ocular/oculodermal (oculo) melanocytosis is a congenital periocular pigmentary condition that can lead to the development of uveal melanoma, estimated at 1 in 400 affected patients.  risk factors so far identified include pre-existing choroidal naevi for uveal melanomas, primary acquired melanosis (pam) for conjunctival tumours, and ocular and oculodermal melanocytosis for uveal and orbital lesions.  ocular melanoma is a rare but potentially devastating malignancy arising from the melanocytes of the uveal tract, conjunctiva, or orbit; it represents less than 5% of all melanoma cases in the united states.  ocular melanoma is a rare but often deadly malignancy that arises in the uvea, conjunctiva, or orbit.  this study was designed to determine the lifetime prevalence of uveal melanoma among patients with ocular melanocytosis.  multifocal uveal melanoma has been described previously and has been associated with ocular melanocytosis.  patients with odm should be monitored ophthalmoscopically, especially during the susceptible period, for the development of uveal melanoma.  to determine the relationship of oculo(dermal) melanocytosis to the prognosis of patients with uveal melanoma.  in the white population, an association between oculo(dermal) melanocytosis (odm) and uveal melanoma is well recognized.  frequently, uveal melanoma arises from choroid or iris.  in this study, patients with melanocytosis who developed uveal melanoma were found to have double the risk for metastasis compared with those without melanocytosis.  by multivariable analysis, the factors predictive of metastasis in patients harboring uveal melanoma associated with oculo(dermal) melanocytosis were increased tumor thickness (p = .001) and the presence of subretinal fluid (p = .05), and the only factor predictive of death was increased tumor thickness (p = .009).  ocular melanoma is a rare subtype of melanoma, which includes uveal melanoma (um) and conjunctival melanoma.  recent statistical work which shows that the risk of uveal melanoma is greater in patients with melanocytosis oculi than in the normal white population is recalled.  one of about 400 patients with odm followed for life is estimated to develop uveal melanoma. ||| ",yes
Is olaparib effective for prostate cancer?,"in the current study, new strategies to improve the therapeutic efficacy of olaparib for the treatment of prostate cancer were investigated.  the toparp-a clinical trial demonstrated that the parp inhibitor olaparib may be an effective strategy for treating prostate cancer.  the combination of the c-met inhibitor pha665752 and the parp inhibitor olaparib may be a promising therapeutic strategy in patients with prostate cancer.  the authors also provide their expert opinion and future perspectives for the place of this drug in the current treatment armamentarium.expert opinion: olaparib is the first drug to prove that genetic sequencing and precise medicine is a viable and important option for prostate cancer patients.  olaparib is clinically approved for the treatment prostate cancer, but cytotoxicity and off-target effects including dna damage limit its clinical applications.  olaparib in combination with abiraterone provided clinical efficacy benefit for patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer compared with abiraterone alone.  the poly adp ribose polymerase (parp) inhibitor olaparib has been approved for treating prostate cancer (pca) with brca mutations, and veliparib, another parp inhibitor, is being tested in clinical trials.  our data suggest that the combination of olaparib and abiraterone might provide an additional clinical benefit to a broad population of patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.  we previously reported that olaparib led to significantly longer imaging-based progression-free survival than the physician's choice of enzalutamide or abiraterone among men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer who had qualifying alterations in homologous recombination repair genes and whose disease had progressed during previous treatment with a next-generation hormonal agent.  we aimed to assess the efficacy of olaparib plus the androgen pathway inhibitor abiraterone in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer regardless of hrr mutation status.  preclinical data suggest synergy between olaparib and androgen pathway inhibitors.  recent findings from a phase ii trial suggest that combining the antiandrogen abiraterone and the parp inhibitor olaparib significantly improves progression-free survival among patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, regardless of their homologous recombination repair-mutation status.  two prostate cancer cell lines were exposed to the c-met inhibitor pha665752 and/or the parp inhibitor olaparib.  here, we tested putative cross-resistance between current therapies and olaparib in treatment-resistant castration-resistant prostate cancer models.  patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer and homologous recombination repair (hrr) mutations have a better response to treatment with the poly(adp-ribose) polymerase inhibitor olaparib than patients without hrr mutations.  treatment with sabr for oligometastatic prostate cancer improved outcomes and was enhanced by total consolidation of disease identified by psma-targeted positron emission tomography.  locoregional therapy for oligometastatic prostate cancer has generated great interest.  the optimal treatment for oligorecurrent prostate cancer (pca) is a matter of debate.  cell counting kit-8, colony formation assays, and transwell assays were conducted to evaluate the cytotoxicity of olaparib alone or in combination with pha665752 in prostate cancer cell lines.  among men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer who had tumors with at least one alteration in brca1, brca2, or atm and whose disease had progressed during previous treatment with a next-generation hormonal agent, those who were initially assigned to receive olaparib had a significantly longer duration of overall survival than those who were assigned to receive enzalutamide or abiraterone plus prednisone as the control therapy, despite substantial crossover from control therapy to olaparib. ||| ",yes

Is osteocrin expressed exclusively in the bone?,"osteocalcin is an abundant, highly conserved bone-specific protein that is synthesized by osteoblasts.  osteocalcin is synthesized only by the osteoblast and it is secreted into the bone matrix at the time of bone mineralization.  the osteocalcin gene encodes a 6-kda polypeptide, which represents one of the most abundant noncollagenous bone proteins, and the present studies establish that osteocalcin mrna is detected only in bone tissue.  osteocalcin (oc) is the most abundant non-collagenous bone protein and is determinant for bone mineralization.  osteocalcin (oc) is a bone-specific protein secreted by osteoblasts and often used as a bone formation biomarker.  osteocalcin is a major noncollagenous protein component of bone extracellular matrix, synthesized and secreted exclusively by osteoblastic cells in the late stage of maturation, and is considered indicator of osteoblast differentiation.  osteocalcin (oc), an extracellular calcium-binding protein of bone origin, is synthesized by osteoblasts and binds with high specificity to bone mineral crystals.  osteocalcin is one of the most abundant noncollagenous proteins in bone.  osteocalcin is one of the most abundant noncollagenous proteins found in adult bone.  these data indicate that oc mrna is not restricted to cells on mineralizing surfaces, but is also found in megakaryocytes and peripheral blood platelets, which possibly contribute to the oc levels in blood and the regulation of bone turnover.  osteocalcin is a hormone produced in bones by osteoblasts and regulating energy metabolism.  osteocalcin, the gamma-carboxyglutamic acid-containing protein, which is the most abundant noncollagenous protein of bone and dentin, is considered to play roles in bone formation and remodeling.  osteocalcin, a bone-specific protein and marker of the mature osteoblast, is expressed only in nonproliferating osteoblasts in a mineralizing extracellular matrix, while type i collagen is expressed in proliferating cells.  osteocalcin (oc) is the main non-collagenous hydroxyapatite-binding protein synthesized by osteoblasts, odontoblasts, and hypertrophic chondrocytes.  a role for osteocalcin in bone resorption has been suggested because of its ability to influence recruitment and differentiation of osteoclasts at the bone surface.  the mineral binding properties of osteocalcin as well as its spatial and temporal pattern of expression suggest that it plays a role during bone mineralization, however until now its biological function is unclear.  osteocalcin (bone gamma-carboxyglutamic acid-containing protein) is exclusively produced by osteoblasts, which are the major target cells of parathyroid hormone (pth) in bone.  bone, whether of endochondral or intramembranous origin, contains the vitamin k-dependent calcium binding amino acid residue gamma-carboxyglutamic acid (gla) in a small, anionic protein we have named osteocalcin.  osteocalcin (oc) is a major noncollagenous bone protein whose expression is limited almost exclusively to osteotropic tumors and mature calcified tissue (differentiated osteoblasts).  osteocalcin (oc), an abundant gamma-carboxylated protein (mol wt, 5800) of bone matrix, is used as a serum marker of bone turnover because it is considered to be uniquely synthesized by the osteoblast. ||| ",no
Is overproduction of transthyretin is associated with amyloidosis associated neuropathy?,"transthyretin is an amyloidogenic protein that causes human amyloid polyneuropathy and senile systemic amyloidosis as a result of the deposition of normal and/or mutant transthyretin in the form of amyloid fibrils.  mutations in transthyretin (ttr) are associated with familial amyloid polyneuropathy, a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by ttr deposition in the pns.  this is the first report showing the relationship between wild-type transthyretin deposition and aging in familial amyloid polyneuropathy patients.  transthyretin (ttr) is a homotetrameric plasma protein with amyloidogenic properties that has been linked to the development of familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy (fap), familial amyloidotic cardiomyopathy, and senile systemic amyloidosis.  misfolded and aggregated transthyretins (agttr) contribute to neurodegenerative amyloid diseases such as familial amyloid polyneuropathy and senile systemic amyloidosis.  transthyretin amyloidosis is a conformational pathology characterized by the extracellular formation of amyloid deposits and the progressive impairment of the peripheral nervous system.  transthyretin (ttr) is a plasma homotetrameric protein associated with senile systemic amyloidosis and familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy.  transthyretin (ttr)-related familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy, which is induced by amyloidogenic transthyretin (attr), is characterized by systemic accumulation of amyloid fibrils.  wild-type transthyretin is inherently an amyloidogenic protein, but its contribution to the formation of amyloid fibrils remains unclear in familial amyloid polyneuropathy patients.  transthyretin (ttr) is a protein linked to a number of different amyloid diseases including senile systemic amyloidosis and familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy.  human transthyretin (ttr) is a homotetrameric protein that is responsible for the formation of amyloid in patients with familiar amyloidotic polyneuropathy (fap), familiar amyloidotic cardiomyopathy (fac) and senile systemic amyloidosis (ssa).  our results indicate that wild-type transthyretin significantly contributes to the formation of amyloid fibrils in familial amyloid polyneuropathy patients with amyloidogenic transthyretin val30met, and its contribution tends to increase in older patients, suggesting that aging may play an important role in wild-type transthyretin-derived amyloid fibril formation in familial amyloid polyneuropathy patients.  transthyretin (ttr) is a homotetrameric protein that circulates in plasma and cerebral spinal fluid (csf) whose aggregation into amyloid fibrils has been associated with at least two different amyloid diseases: senile systemic amyloidosis (ssa) and familial amyloid polyneuropathy (fap).  variant forms of the plasma protein transthyretin (ttr) are associated with the most frequently occurring type of familial systemic amyloidosis.  the mutant amyloidogenic transthyretin protein causes the systemic accumulation of amyloid fibrils that result in organ dysfunction.  transthyretin (ttr) is an extracellular protein able to deposit into well-defined protein aggregates called amyloid, in pathological conditions known as senile systemic amyloidosis, familial amyloid polyneuropathy, familial amyloid cardiomyopathy and leptomeningeal amyloidosis.  transthyretin-related familial amyloid polyneuropathy (ttr-fap) is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by mutations of the transthyretin (ttr) gene.  our aim in this study was to elucidate the ratio of wild-type transthyretin in amyloid deposits in familial amyloid polyneuropathy patients.  transthyretin (ttr) is a major amyloid fibril protein found in patients with familial amyloidotic polynuropathy (fap) and senile systemic amyloidosis (ssa).  human transthyretin (httr), a serum protein with a main role in transporting thyroid hormones and retinol through binding to the retinol-binding protein, is an amyloidogenic protein involved in familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy (fap), familial amyloidotic cardiomyopathy, and central nervous system selective amyloidosis. ||| ",yes
Is oxalate renal excretion increased after bariatric surgery?,"therefore, after bariatric surgery, increases in fecal fat excretion, urinary oxalate excretion after an oral oxalate load, plasma oxalate, and urinary calcium oxalate supersaturation values were observed.  we hypothesized that after bariatric surgery, intestinal hyperabsorption of oxalate contributes to increases in plasma oxalate and urinary calcium oxalate supersaturation.  bariatric surgery (bs) may be associated with increased oxalate excretion and a higher risk of nephrolithiasis.  the mean oxaluric response to an oxalate load is markedly elevated in post-bariatric surgery patients, suggesting that increased intestinal absorption of dietary oxalate is a predisposing mechanism for enteric hyperoxaluria.  enteric hyperoxalosis is a recognized complication of bariatric surgery, with consequent oxalate nephropathy leading to chronic kidney disease and occasionally end-stage renal failure.  the urinary oxalate excretion was studied for 10-13 days during enteral and parenteral nutrition in six patients operated on because of massive obesity with a jejunoileostomy.  the present study aimed to investigate the underlying mechanisms contributing to increased urinary oxalate in a mini-gastric bypass (mgb) surgery model in rats under different dietary conditions.  we report two cases of renal allograft oxalate nephropathy in patients with remote histories of bariatric surgery.  hyperoxaluria and increased calcium oxalate stone formation occur after roux-en-y gastric bypass (rygb) surgery for morbid obesity.  roux-en-y (r-y) gastric bypass, also known as bariatric surgery, sometimes causes postoperative hyperoxaluria and subsequent oxalate nephrolithiasis in obese patients.  with an increasing prevalence of obesity and metabolic syndrome in the past 30 years, urinary oxalate has significantly increased.  enteric hyperoxaluria and oxalate urolithiasis in patients with ileal resection seem to be caused by intestinal hyperabsorption of oxalate.  thus, reduced active intestinal oxalate secretion, likely secondary to local and systemic inflammation, contributes to the pathogenesis of obesity-associated hyperoxaluria.  hyperoxaluria and oxalate kidney stones frequently develop after roux-en-y gastric bypass (rygb).  studies have shown that compensatory adaptations in gastrointestinal oxalate transport can impact the amount of oxalate excreted by the kidney.  we prospectively examined oxalate metabolism in 11 morbidly obese subjects before and 6 and 12 months after rygb (n = 9) and biliopancreatic diversion-duodenal switch (bpd-ds) (n = 2).  on a moderate oxalate diet, urinary oxalate excretion was 4-fold higher in rygb than sham controls.  bariatric surgery is associated with hyperoxaluria hence predisposing to nephrolithiasis.  gastric bypass surgery for obesity is known to be associated with postoperative hyperoxaluria, which can lead to urolithiasis and kidney damage.  as the incidence of obesity and pretransplant bariatric surgery increases in the transplant population, allograft oxalate nephropathy is likely to be an increasing cause of allograft dysfunction. ||| ",yes
Is oxidative stress affected by FOXO expression?,"key to these processes is the ability of foxo to regulate, and be regulated by, oxidative stress.  foxo3a, the main isoform of foxo transcription factors, mediates the cellular response to oxidative stress by regulating the expression of genes involved in dna repair and glutamine metabolism, including glutamine synthetase (gs).  foxo transcription factors induce apoptosis and regulate cellular production of reactive oxygen species (ros).  the foxo family of forkhead transcription factors have a pivotal role in determining cell fate in response to oxidative stress.  forkhead box o (foxo) family of transcription factors are activated by oxidative signals and regulate cell proliferation and resistance to oxidative stress.  here, we investigated whether foxos are required in oxidative stress induced epc apoptosis.  the o-type forkhead domain transcription factor (foxo) is involved in many biological processes such as aging, the oxidative stress response, and growth regulation.  perturbation of the mechanisms that tightly couple reactive oxygen species (ros) production, oxidative stress signaling, and foxo activity to the subsequent cellular response is a pivotal step in cancer development and progression.  the forkhead homeobox type o (foxo) transcription factors foxo1, foxo3a, and foxo4 are critical mediators of the cellular responses to oxidative stress and have been implicated in many of the above ros-regulated processes.  to examine whether the phosphorylation of the o subfamily of forkhead transcription factors (foxo) is involved in response to oxidative stress in rat aortic endothelial cells (raecs).  dependent on their posttranslational modifications foxos can also actively regulate the detoxification of cells from ros and promote stress resistance.  our data demonstrate that phosphorylation of foxo1 by pi-3k/akt signaling is implicated in response to oxidative stress in vascular endothelial cells.  foxo6, a member of the foxo family, helps regulate oxidative stress in gastric cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma.  these data suggest that oxidative stress induced impairment of epc survival is mediated through a foxo3a dependant mechanism, possibly by transcriptional regulation of bim.  the present study was performed to evaluate the potential role of foxo6 in regulating hypoxia-induced apoptosis and oxidative stress in cardiomyocytes in vitro.  forkhead box protein o6 (foxo6) has been recently identified as a novel regulator of oxidative stress in multiple pathological processes.  the transcriptional activity of foxo1 in h(2)0(2) stress was assessed by luciferase reporter assay.  ros-control by foxo is mediated by transcriptional activation of detoxifying enzymes such as superoxide dismutase 2 (sod2), catalase or sestrins or by the repression of mitochondrial respiratory chain proteins resulting in reduced mitochondrial activity.  our findings suggest that in response to oxidative stress, the nuclear retention of foxo3a in astrocytes upregulates expression of gs as a neuroprotective mechanism.  in contrast, overexpression of foxo6 enhanced the sensitivity of cardiomyocytes to hypoxia-induced injury. ||| ",yes
Is p100 the precursor protein molecule of the NF-kappaB transcription factor subunit p50?,"the p50 subunit of the nf-kappa b transcription complex is derived from the n-terminal half of a larger precursor protein, p105.  nf-kappa b is a transcription factor composed of the p50 and p65 subunits.  a precursor, p105, for one of the subunits (p50) of the nf-kappa b transcription factor, plays an important role in inducible expression of diverse cellular genes.  proteolytic processing of the nuclear factor (nf)-kappab2 precursor protein p100 generates the active nf-kappab2 subunit p52, which in turn transcriptionally up-regulates p100 expression.  p50 corresponds to the n terminus of p105 and with p65 (rela) forms the prototypical nf-kappab transcription factor complex.  the polypeptide (p)50 molecule, a subunit of nuclear factor (nf)-kappab, is produced after proteolytic processing of the p105 precursor (nf-kappab1).  the prototranscription factor p100 represents an intersection of the nf-kappab and ikappab families, potentially serving as both the precursor for the active nf-kappab subunit p52 and as an ikappab capable of retaining nf-kappab in the cytoplasm.  the nf-kb2 gene encodes the cytoplasmic nf-kappab inhibitory protein p100 from which the active p52 nf-kappab subunit is derived by proteasome-mediated proteolysis.  the inducible pleiotropic transcription factor nf-kappa b is composed of two subunits, p50 and p65.  regulation of the transcription factor nf-kappab involves proteasome-mediated processing of the nf-kappab1 p105 precursor protein, which generates the p50 subunit of nf-kappab.  the nf-kappa b precursor p100 (lyt-10, p97, p98) generates after proteolytic processing a 52 kda subunit, which can bind to kappa b-motifs.  the nf-kappa b transcription factor p50 and the rel protein-specific transcription inhibitor p105 are both encoded by the nfkb1 gene.  proteasome-mediated processing of the nfkappab2 gene product p100 is a regulated event that generates the nf-kappab subunit p52.  the nfkb2 gene encodes the p100 precursor which produces the p52 protein after proteolytic cleavage of its cooh-terminal domain.  the dna binding subunit of the transcription factor nf-kappa b, p50, has been cloned.  generation of the nf-kappab p50 transcription factor is mediated by the proteasome.  although the p52 product can act as an alternative subunit of nf-kappab, the p100 precursor is believed to function as an inhibitor of rel/nf-kappab activity by cytoplasmic retention of rel/nf-kappab complexes, like other members of the ikappab family.  in this study p100 was analysed for its ability to interact with its own processing product p52, with p50, the product of the nf-kappa b precursor p105, and with other nf-kappa b/rel-proteins.  transcription factor nf-kappab is generally considered to be a heterodimer with two subunits, p50 and p65.  these findings demonstrate the physiological relevance of the nf-kappab2 p100 precursor protein in limiting the potentially detrimental effects of constitutive nf-kappab2 signaling in lymphocytes. ||| ",no
Is p53 a transcription factor?,"the tumor suppressor p53 possesses characteristics of a transcription factor; it binds to specific dna sequences and activates transcription from various promoters.  p53, known as a tumor suppressor gene, is a transcription factor that regulates various cellular functions.  compelling evidence indicates that p53 acts as a transcription factor and that this activity is regulated by several factors including subcellular localization and phosphorylation status of the protein.  p53 acts as a transcriptional regulator that binds to dna and modulates transcription of several promoters.  antioncogene product p53 is a transcriptional transactivator.  p53 has trans-activates or downregulates its own transcription.  these results imply that p53 may be a transcriptional activating factor (taf); furthermore, these data lend support to the hypothesis of p53 as a positive regulator of transcription which might mediate its tumor suppressor role by inducing expression of a set of genes with a negative effect on cellular growth.  to investigate how p53 stimulates transcription, we examined the interaction of p53 with general transcription factors in vitro.  the tumor suppressor, p53, has been shown to transcriptionally activate or silence a number of target genes.  p53 is a sequence-specific dna-binding oligomeric protein that can activate transcription from promoters bearing p53-binding sites.  the product of the tumor suppressor gene p53 binds to dna and activates transcription from promoters containing its consensus binding site.  the wild-type p53 protein is a transcriptional activator implicated in the control of cellular growth-related gene expression.  p53 autoregulates its own promoter indirectly and in a cell type-specific manner.  the tumor suppressor protein p53 acts as a transcriptional activator that can mediate cellular responses to dna damage by inducing apoptosis and cell cycle arrest.  p53 is most commonly described as a tumor suppressor, or anti-oncogene, although its role in vivo remains unclear.  p53 on its own promoter in different cell lines that do not express p53.  recently, several growth factor gene promoters, including that of transforming growth factor alpha (tgf-alpha), were shown to be direct targets of p53-mediated transcription.  the p53 tumor suppressor gene, which is considered the guardian of the genome, encodes a phosphoprotein, which is a sequence-specific transcriptional activator or repressor of target genes.  wild-type p53 has also been shown to autoregulate its own transcription.  p53 is a nuclear phosphoprotein, and phosphorylation has been proposed to be a means by which the activity of p53 is regulated. ||| ",yes
Is paramyxovirus involved in human subacute thyroiditis?,"most cases of subacute thyroiditis are caused by a variety of viruses, for example, coxsackie, cytomegalovirus, epstein-barr virus, and adenovirus.  from indirect and circumstantial evidence it would appear that subacute thyroiditis is probably a viral infection of the thyroid gland.  subacute thyroiditis is an inflammatory disease of the thyroid gland, most probably preceded by viral infection.  subacute thyroiditis is generally believed to be induced by viral infection, and little attention has been paid to anti-thyroid antibodies.  although viral infection is thought to be associated with subacute thyroiditis and probably with autoimmune thyroid disease, possible changes in thyroid function during the prodromal period of infection or subclinical infection remain largely unknown.  influenza immunization or infection may cause subacute thyroiditis.  subacute granulomatous thyroiditis is an inflammatory thyroid condition that is presumed to be caused by a viral infection or postviral inflammatory process.  subacute (de quervain's) thyroiditis is a rare but important cause of fever of unknown origin.  a case is presented of subacute granulomatous thyroiditis in an adult woman who had no neck pain but presented with morning stiffness in the small joints of the right hand, intermittent abdominal pain, malaise, fever, and myalgia.  enterovirus (ev) infection of thyroid cells has been implicated as a possible initiator of cell damage and of organ-specific autoimmunity.  a case of sub-acute thyroiditis, confirmed by histology, occurring in a patient with infectious mononucleosis is now reported.  recently, a previously undescribed paramyxovirus, designated 'human metapneumovirus' (hmpv), was isolated from children with respiratory illness.  infectious mononucleosis has been associated with sub-acute thyroiditis in only two papers, and histological evidence of sub-acute thyroiditis was lacking in both.  these observations in an experimental model support the hypothesis that viruses may account for some thyroid disorders in man.  although viral infection has been suspected as the cause of some thyroid disorders, there has been limited data to support this contention seriously.  herein, we report a case of subacute thyroiditis associated pain, which was initially mistaken and treated as pain of dental origin after otorhinolaryngologic examination revealed no pathology.  a viral aetiology for sub-acute (de quervain's) thyroiditis has long been postulated although proof has been elusive.  autoimmune thyroiditis probably also contributed to subclinical hypothyroidism in another patient.  paget's disease of bone is currently believed to be the result of a paramyxovirus infection of osteoclasts.  sars-cov-2-related thyroiditis is increasingly recognized. ||| ",no
Is paroxetine effective for treatment of premenstrual dysphoric disorder?,"serotonergic antidepressants have been shown to be effective treatments for premenstrual dysphoric disorder (pmdd).  fluoxetine is useful in the treatment of premenstrual dysphoria.  we evaluated the efficacy and safety of fluoxetine (which selectively inhibits the reuptake of serotonin) in the treatment of premenstrual dysphoria.  evidence that serotonergic antidepressants are effective for treating premenstrual syndrome (pms) raises the question of whether dosing only in the symptomatic premenstrual phase is effective for this disorder.  sertraline was significantly more effective than a placebo and was well tolerated as a treatment for premenstrual dysphoric disorder when administered intermittently during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle.  the goal of the current study was to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of sertraline for premenstrual dysphoric disorder when treatment was limited to the luteal phase.  this preliminary study compared the efficacy and tolerability of escitalopram administered at symptom onset or throughout the luteal phase in premenstrual dysphoric disorder (pmdd).  two hundred eighty-one women who met diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (4th edition) criteria for premenstrual dysphoric disorder and who completed two prospective screening cycles and one single-blind placebo cycle were randomized to three cycles of double-blind, luteal phase treatment with either a placebo or sertraline in a flexible daily dose of 50-100 mg.  premenstrual dysphoric disorder improved significantly with either luteal phase or symptom-onset dosing of escitalopram.  although research has established a strong association between premenstrual dysphoric symptoms and depression, there is little data on the effect of antidepressents on premenstrual symptoms.  paroxetine is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (ssri) with proven efficacy in the treatment of depression, panic disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder.  anxiety and depression commonly occur in premenstrual dysphoric disorder (pmdd).  these preliminary results suggest that fluoxetine is an effective and well-tolerated treatment for severe pms.  premenstrual dysphoria shares certain features with depression and anxiety states, which have been linked to serotonergic dysregulation.  premenstrual dysphoric disorder is a menstrually related disorder that intermittently causes disabling emotional, behavioral, and physical symptoms.  the results add support to other preliminary reports of efficacy of serotonergic antidepressants administered premenstrually and indicate the clinical importance of determining an optimal dose/benefit ratio of serotonergic antidepressants for pms patients.  this study determined if women with premenstrual dysphoric disorder (pms) showed impaired mood and performance when they were experiencing their premenstrual symptoms, and if the effects of alprazolam varied as a function of menstrual cycle phase.  paroxetine is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor commonly prescribed for the treatment of depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, panic disorder, social anxiety disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder.  taken together, these studies confirm that paroxetine is an effective and well tolerated treatment for patients with social anxiety disorder.  this study compared the efficacy of three treatments--imipramine, phenelzine, and placebo--on the premenstrual symptoms of women with atypical depression who had responded to treatment for their depressive symptoms. ||| ",yes
Is patisiran currently (November 2017) in clinical phase II trials?,"it is in phase ii clinical trials for malignant fibrous histiocytoma.  the ongoing phase iib power 1 (tmc114-c213) trial is designed to assess efficacy and safety of the protease inhibitor (pi) tmc114 (darunavir) in treatment-experienced hiv-1-infected patients.  ilex conducted phase ii clinical trials in the us and europe with piritrexim in bladder cancer patients; however, development for this indication was discontinued in the third quarter of 1998 due to lack of efficacy.  we conducted an open-label, phase ii multicenter therapeutic trial investigating the efficacy and tolerability of vatalanib in patients with metastatic or advanced pancreatic cancer who failed first-line gemcitabine-based therapy.  at the time of writing, a total of eight studies addressing its preclinical and clinical development have been published on this compound, which is currently in phase 2 of clinical development, alongside lumefantrine in a novel soluble formulation as combination partner.  pamiparib (partruvix™; beigene ltd.) is a selective poly (adp-ribose) polymerase 1 and 2 (parp1 and parp2) inhibitor being developed for the treatment of various cancers.  peficitinib, a janus kinase (jak) inhibitor, is approved for clinical use in japan, korea, and taiwan, but head-to-head comparisons versus other jak inhibitors are lacking.  based on the results from the pivotal phase ii portion of a phase i/ii trial (nct03333915) pamiparib was recently approved in china for the treatment of germline brca mutation-associated recurrent advanced ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer previously treated with two or more lines of chemotherapy.  piritrexim was discovered by burroughs wellcome, which conducted phase i and ii clinical trials in more than 700 patients.  this review focuses on the clinical development of the prototype broad spectrum inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases (cdks), flavopiridol, now undergoing phase ii single-agent trials and phase i combination trials (with paclitaxel and cisplatin).  we report the results of a multiinstitutional, open-label, 2-stage, phase ii study that further evaluates oral piritrexim in patients with urothelial carcinoma and who proved nonresponsive to standard chemotherapy.  while there has been some evidence of single-agent antitumour activity (partial responses in a patient with renal cancer and another with gastric cancer), ongoing combination studies, especially with paclitaxel, where preclinical synergistic antitumour effects are observed, are promising.  the drug showed in vivo antitumour activity (using iv., ip.  it has been evaluated in non-small-cell lung cancer (nsclc) as front-line chemotherapy in a comprehensive phase ii evaluation.  vatalanib (ptk 787/zk22584) is an oral poly-tyrosine kinase inhibitor with strong affinity for platelet-derived growth factor and vascular endothelial growth factor (vegf) receptors.  patients in this phase ii, placebo-controlled study (nct02201524) were randomized to receive placebo, 200 mg once daily (od), 400 mg od or 200 mg twice daily (td) pf-04965842 for 4 weeks.  panitumumab is approved for ras wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer and was evaluated in phase iii (prime, nct00364013) and phase ii (peak, nct00819780) first-line randomised studies.  the company also initiated phase iii trials in early 1997 for the treatment of aids-related kaposi's sarcoma, but no further development for this indication has been reported since that time.  we searched medline, embase, the cochrane central register of controlled trials, clinicaltrials.gov, and congress archives up until february 12, 2019, for randomized controlled trials of peficitinib, tofacitinib, and baricitinib.  in published phase ii studies, piritrexim demonstrated objective response rates ranging from 23 to 75% in patients with advanced bladder cancer who failed a standard first-line chemotherapy regimen. ||| ",no
Is peripheral neuroepithelioma related to Ewing sarcoma?,"ewing sarcoma/peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumors (es/ppnet), a member of the ewing sarcoma family of tumors, is a malignant soft tissue tumor with small undifferentiated neuroectodermal cells.  ewing sarcoma (es) and peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumor are part of a spectrum of neoplastic diseases known as the es family of tumors, which also includes extraosseous es, peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumor, malignant small-cell tumor of the thoracopulmonary region (askin's tumor), and atypical es.  ewing's sarcoma (es) and primitive neuroectodermal tumor (pnet) are closely related malignant neoplasms, usually affecting the skeletal system.  some researchers have suggested that pn is morphologically a neuroectodermal ewing's sarcoma.  ewing's sarcoma of bone (esb) and peripheral neuroepithelioma (pn) are frequently considered to be different tumors.  they also suggest a close relationship between ewing's sarcoma and peripheral neural tumors, including the chest wall tumor described by askin, but only a distant relationship to neuroblastoma.  current evidence indicates that peripheral pnets (ppnets), which arise in the non-central nervous system, possess histological similarity to ewing's sarcoma.  ewing's sarcoma/primitive neuroectodermal tumor (es/pnet) family of tumors is an uncommon group of malignant neoplasms that may present in both skeletal and extraskeletal sites.  peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumor (pnet) belongs to the pnet/ewing's sarcoma family.  the ewing family of tumors and peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumor (ppnet) represent different manifestations of the same entity.  extraskeletal ewing's sarcoma (e-ews)/peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumor (ppnet) is a rare soft tissue tumor that arises from a multipotent progenitor cell and is considered to be of neuroectodermal origin.  primitive neuroectodermal tumors (pnet, previously referred to as peripheral neuroepithelioma) are rare malignant tumors with various degrees of differentiation belonging to the ewing's family of sarcomas.  as part of the 'small round-cell tumor' family, ewing's sarcoma (es) is a malignant mesenchymal tumor classified as a primitive neuroectodermal tumor (pnet).  the peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumor/ewing's sarcoma family tumor (ppnet/esft) group includes small round cell tumors of the bone, soft tissue, and nerve with morphological attributes of the germinal neuroepithelium.  recent studies have suggested a relationship to an unusual form of childhood neural tumor, often termed peripheral neuroepithelioma or primitive neuroectodermal tumor.  primary spinal extradural ewing's sarcoma/primitive neuroectodermal tumor (pnet) is rare malignant tumor of childhood and early adulthood.  peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumor (ppnet) is a highly aggressive small round cell tumor belonging to pnet/ewing sarcoma family.  extraosseous ewing's sarcoma/primitive neuroectodermal tumor (ees/pnet) of the kidney is an uncommon entity and usually arises from the retroperitoneum and paraspinal region.  these results provide convincing evidence for a neural histogenesis of ewing's sarcoma.  pnet is a highly malignant tumor that is subordinated to ewing sarcoma. ||| ",yes
Is pesticide exposure associated with polyneuropathy?,"neurological characteristics were assessed to determine their relationship with previously reported pesticide-related illnesses.  increasing toxicologic and epidemiologic evidence suggests that pesticides and other environmental exposures are associated with idiopathic parkinson's disease.  association of parkinson's disease and its subtypes with agricultural pesticide exposures in men: a case-control study in france.  epidemiological evidence suggests that pesticides and other environmental exposures may have a role in the etiology of idiopathic parkinson's disease (pd).  the purpose of this study is to evaluate the association between pesticides and neurological symptoms among a population exposed to organophosphate chemicals as a result of agricultural use.  for more than two decades, reports have suggested that pesticides and herbicides may be an etiologic factor in idiopathic parkinson's disease (pd).  epidemiological studies have reported an increased risk of parkinson's disease (pd) in farmers exposed to pesticides, but no clear conclusion can be drawn on the type of pesticide and duration of use associated with an effect.  increasing epidemiological and toxicological evidence suggests that pesticides and other environmental exposures may be associated with the development of parkinson's disease (pd).  exposure to pesticides may be a risk factor for developing parkinson's disease (pd).  chronic, low-dose exposure to pesticides is suspected to increase the risk for parkinson's disease (pd), but data are inconclusive.  individuals who have had an acute pesticide poisoning have been reported to suffer a wide range of neurological symptoms that occur from weeks to months after the initial episode.  previous research has indicated that occupational exposure to pesticides and possibly airborne endotoxin may increase the risk of developing parkinson disease (pd).  there is a general consensus that pesticides are involved in the aetiology of parkinson's disease (pd), although associations between specific pesticides and the risk of developing pd have not been well studied.  this study helps to better characterize different aspects of pesticide exposure associated with pd, and shows a significant association of pesticides with tremor-dominant pd in men, the most typical pd presentation.  an association between polyneuropathy and occupational exposure to trichloroethylene, trichloroethane, perchloroethylene, or similar solvents alone or in combination is controversial.  peripheral neuropathy is the commonest neurological syndrome produced by industrial and agricultural chemicals.  pesticides have been associated with parkinson's disease (pd), but there are few data on important exposure characteristics such as dose-effect relations.  chronic sequelae of acute pesticide poisoning from organophosphate compounds include a variety of neurological symptoms including restlessness, irritability, and trouble sleeping.  in these conditions and to a different extent, pesticides such as paraquat, maneb and other dithiocarbamates, pyrethroids, rotenone, and dieldrin cause neurotoxic effects that may suggest a possible role in the development of a pd-like syndrome in animals.  we prospectively examined whether individuals exposed to pesticides have higher risk for pd than those not exposed. ||| ",yes
Is phospholamban a regulatory/inhibitory protein of the Ca ATPase SERCA?,"phospholamban (pln) functions as an inhibitory cofactor for cardiac ca-atpase (serca2).  phospholamban is a pentameric transmembrane phosphoprotein that regulates the activity of the ca(2+)-transporting atpase (serca2a) in cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum.  phospholamban is a regulatory phosphoprotein which modulates the active transport of ca2+ by the cardiac sarcoplasmic reticular ca(2+)-atpase enzyme (serca2) into the lumen of the sarcoplasmic reticulum.  functional properties of phospholamban by steady-state and presteady-state kinetic studies of ca pump atpase suggest that phospholamban functions as an inhibitory co-factor for cardiac ca atpase (serca 2).  phospholamban is a phosphoprotein in the cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum (sr) which regulates the apparent ca(2+) affinity of the sr ca(2+)-atpase (serca2).  phospholamban (plb) regulates the cardiac ca2+-atpase (serca2a) in sarcoplasmic reticulum (sr).  phosphorylation by protein kinase a and dephosphorylation by protein phosphatase 1 modulate the inhibitory activity of phospholamban (pln), the endogenous regulator of the sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum calcium ca(2+) atpase (serca).  phospholamban (plb) is a pentameric protein that plays an important role in regulating cardiac contractility via a reversible inhibitory association with the sarcoplasmic reticulum ca2+atpase (serca), the enzyme responsible for maintaining correct calcium homeostasis.  these findings indicate that phospholamban is an inhibitor of the ca2(+)-atpase in cardiac sr and phosphorylation of phospholamban relieves this inhibition.  the sarcoplasmic reticulum (sr) ca2+-atpase (serca2a) is under the control of an sr protein named phospholamban (pln).  the mechanism by which phospholamban inhibits the ca2+ pump is unknown, but our findings with the synthetic peptide suggest that a direct interaction between the ca2(+)-atpase and the hydrophilic portion of phospholamban may be one of the mechanisms for regulation.  these results indicate that phospholamban suppresses ca2+ pump atpase at two different sites, the cytoplasmic domain for vmax and the transmembrane domain for kca, and that camp-dependent phosphorylation de-suppresses these inhibitory effects on the atpase.  phospholamban, which is a reversible inhibitor of serca2, represses the enzyme's activity, and this inhibition is relieved upon phosphorylation of phospholamban in response to beta-adrenergic stimulation.  phospholamban is the regulator of the cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum (sr) ca(2+)-atpase activity and an important modulator of basal contractility in the heart.  phospholamban alters the apparent calcium affinity of serca in a process that is modulated by phosphorylation via the β-adrenergic pathway.  protein kinase a-catalyzed phosphorylation of phospholamban results in the dissociation of phospholamban from the ca atpase, thus augmenting the atpase activity.  in this way, phospholamban is an important regulator of serca2-mediated myocardial relaxation during diastole.  regulation of the sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum ca2+-atpase (serca 2a) depends on the phosphorylation state of phospholamban (plb).  phospholamban, a putative regulator of cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum ca2+ transport, has been shown to be phosphorylated in vitro by camp-dependent protein kinase and an intrinsic ca2+-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase activity.  phospholamban (pln) is a key regulator of ca(2+) homeostasis and contractility in the heart. ||| ",yes
Is phospholamban phosphorylated by Protein kinase A?,"phospholamban is phosphorylated by three different protein kinases (camp-dependent, ca2+.cam-dependent and ca2+.phospholipid dependent) at apparently distinct sites.  phospholamban, the cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum proteolipid, is phosphorylated by camp-dependent protein kinase, by ca2+/phospholipid-dependent protein kinase, and by an endogenous ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase, the identity of which remains to be defined.  phosphorylation by protein kinase a and dephosphorylation by protein phosphatase 1 modulate the inhibitory activity of phospholamban (pln), the endogenous regulator of the sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum calcium ca(2+) atpase (serca).  phospholamban is a pentameric transmembrane phosphoprotein that regulates the activity of the ca(2+)-transporting atpase (serca2a) in cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum.  we recently reported that phospholamban, the activator of the cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium pump, is phosphorylated by both camp-dependent protein kinase and a membrane-bound, ca2+/calmodulin-dependent phospholamban kinase.  the aim of this study was therefore to characterize the latter kinase, called phospholamban kinase.  it also phosphorylates phospholamban present in vesicles of cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum and smooth muscle microsomal fractions, and in transformants of escherichia coli which contain a plasmid into which a gene encoding phospholamban has been inserted.  phospholamban is a phosphoprotein regulator of cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum which is phosphorylated in response to beta-adrenergic stimulation.  the activation of the beta-adrenergic system promotes g protein stimulation that, via cyclic adenosine monophosphate (camp), alters the structure of protein kinase a (pka) and leads to phospholamban (plb) phosphorylation.  in the present study, we hypothesized that there is an imbalance between phospholamban phosphorylation and dephosphorylation, with prevalence of protein phosphorylation.  it has now been found that phospholamban consists of 2 distinct proteins; one is the specific substrate for the camp-dependent phosphorylation, and the other for the calmodulin-dependent kinase.  the degree of phospholamban phosphorylation determined by the interaction of specific protein kinases and phosphatases may represent an important control for sarcoplasmic reticulum function and, thus, for the contraction-relaxation cycle in the myocardium.  cyclic gmp-dependent protein kinase phosphorylates purified phospholamban.  phospholamban, a putative regulator of cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum ca2+ transport, has been shown to be phosphorylated in vitro by camp-dependent protein kinase and an intrinsic ca2+-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase activity.  phospholamban (plb), a 52-amino acid protein, regulates the ca-atpase (calcium pump) in cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum (sr) through plb phosphorylation mediated by beta-adrenergic stimulation.  this suggests that phospholamban was more highly phosphorylated in cardiac hypertrophy.  phospholamban is a 52-amino-acid protein that assembles into a pentamer in sarcoplasmic reticulum membranes.  cyclic amp- and calmodulin-dependent phosphorylation of phospholamban occurred independently; when both kinases were operative, the amounts of phosphorylation were additive.  these data suggest that phospholamban kinase might be an isoenzyme of the multifunctional ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase.  phospholamban kinase and glycogen phosphorylase b kinase share the same substrate specificity. ||| ",yes
Is physical performance influenced by thyroid hormone metabolism?,"thyroid hormones may influence physical activity levels.  thyroid hormones are important regulators of energy metabolism and may influence energy processes during physical exercise.  variations in thyroid function within the normal range are associated with differences in metabolism and body composition.  background: changes in muscle mass and strength can be caused by multiple endocrine factors, including thyroid dysfunction.  exercise training may cause changes in thyroid function.  although some studies demonstrate a transient change in thyroid hormones during intense physical performance, most studies agree that these changes are of minor impact, practically reflecting the relative negative energy balance during strenuous exercise.  there are controversial results concerning thyroid hormone metabolism during strenuous exercise in adult athletes and only scant data concerning the impact of strenuous exercise on thyroid hormone metabolism in children and adolescents.  thyroid hormones are important metabolic regulators exerting effects in multiple systemic functions including muscular and cardiorespiratory.  we aimed to evaluate the associations of muscle mass, strength, and physical performance with thyroid hormone in an aged euthyroid population from a community-based cohort.  the aim of this study was to assess the relationships between thyroid function, whole body energy metabolism, and adipokines--mainly leptin and its receptor, sob-r. we measured serum tsh, free tri-iodothyronine (ft(3)), free thyroxine, leptin, and sob-r and assessed energy homeostasis by means of indirect calorimetry, in 27 highly trained athletes and 27 sedentary, healthy men.  in conclusion, although thyroid hormones are only transiently or insignificantly changed during strenuous exercise, adequate caloric intake should be guaranteed in highly performing young athletes in order to counteract the relative negative energy balance and prevent alterations in endocrine-metabolic profile.  to determine the association between plasma thyroid-stimulating hormone (tsh), free triiodothyronine (ft3), and free thyroxine (ft4) levels and physical performance score in middle age and older adults who had levels of all three hormones in the normal range.  male, elite athletes had lower tsh-ft(3) ratio and fli than controls while fli was independently associated with tsh-ft(3) ratio supporting the hypothesis that the level of biologically active leptin is involved in the adaptive response of thyroid function in professional athletes.  thyroid hormones (ths) play a crucial role in the homeostasis of muscle function, such as myogenesis and energy metabolism, suggesting that the thyroid may be also involved in the entropic processes of muscle aging.  these findings suggest that age has a distinct influence on the effect of even subtle change of thyroid function on muscle strength in men.  to give new insights into the mechanisms underlying the changes in thyroid economy after exercise, we used a rat model to evaluate the impact of blocking corticosterone synthesis during treadmill exercise by metyrapone administration.  through this pathway thyroid function might also be associated with cardiorespiratory function and exercise capacity.  interestingly, the lack of corticosterone peak led not only to lower serum t3, but also to decreased serum t4, indicating that corticosterone might be fundamental for the maintenance of serum thyroid hormone levels after high intensity exercise.  the objective was to evaluate whether a physical exercise session alters the thyroid economy and adrenal axis in humans, and the possible role of corticosteroids in thyroid function disturbance.  as skeletal muscle is one of main targets of thyroid hormone signalling, an association of thyroid function and muscle strength could be expected. ||| ",yes
Is poly (ADP- ribosylation) involved in transcriptional control?,"the results of recent studies demonstrate that adp-ribosylation contributes to transcription regulation.  poly(adp-ribosyl)ation is involved in the regulation of a variety of cellular pathways, including, but not limited to, transcription, chromatin, dna damage and other stress signalling.  poly(adp-ribosylation) is a post-translational modification playing a relevant role in dna damage recovery, dna replication and viral integration.  poly(adp-ribosyl)ation of transcription factors and coregulators, mediated by the poly(adp-ribose) polymerase parp-1, has been emerging as an important epigenetic mechanism that controls transcriptional dynamics in response to diverse intra- and extracellular signals.  adp-ribosylation of nuclear proteins, catalysed by the enzyme poly(adp-ribose) polymerase, is involved in the regulation of different cellular processes of dna metabolism.  the function of poly(adp-ribose) is not clear, although it has been suggested to be involved in the regulation of dna transactions such as replication, repair, and transcription.  posttranslational modifications, such as poly(adp-ribosyl)ation (parylation), regulate chromatin-modifying enzymes, ultimately affecting gene expression.  adp-ribosylation has been implicated in a wide variety of cellular processes including cell growth and differentiation, apoptosis and transcriptional regulation.  the post-translational modification poly(adp-ribosyl)ation (parylation) plays key roles in genome maintenance and transcription.  poly(adp-ribose)-polymerase is an important cellular regulatory enzyme which can change chromatin structure and function.  in this model, poly(adp-ribose) polymerase regulates transcription of genes that are induced by dna-damaging agents.  adp-ribosylation is a reversible posttranslational modification mediated by poly-adp-ribose polymerase (parp).  this transcriptional regulation results from poly(adp-ribosyl)ation and inactivation of dna sequence-specific regulatory proteins such as silencer element-binding proteins, thereby inducing transcription of dna polymerase beta, which is a dna repair enzyme in higher eukaryotes.  adp-ribosylation is a reversible and site-specific post-translational modification that regulates a wide array of cellular signaling pathways.  poly(adp-ribosyl)ation plays a major role in dna repair, where it regulates chromatin relaxation as one of the critical events in the repair process.  accumulating evidence suggests an important role for the enzyme poly(adp-ribose) polymerase-1 (parp-1) as an integral part of the gene expression regulatory machinery during development and in response to specific cellular signals.  the synthesis of poly(adp-ribose) can be modulated by interaction of substances with the dna binding site of the poly(adp-ribose)-polymerase.  parp-1 might modulate gene expression through its catalytic activity leading to poly(adp-ribosyl)ation of nuclear proteins or by its physical association with relevant proteins.  studies on poly(adp-ribosyl)ation related to chromatin structure and to nuclear functions such as repair, gene expression and replication are reviewed.  regulation of adp-ribosylation is vital for maintaining genomic integrity, and uncontrolled accumulation of poly(adp-ribosyl)ation triggers a poly(adp-ribose) (par)-dependent release of apoptosis-inducing factor from mitochondria, leading to cell death. ||| ",yes
Is polyadenylation a process that stabilizes a protein by adding a string of Adenosine residues to the end of the molecule?,"polyadenylation is the addition of a poly(a) tail to an rna molecule.  polyadenylation is the process in which the pre-mrna is cleaved at the poly(a) site and a poly(a) tail is added - a process necessary for normal mrna formation.  mrna polyadenylation, the addition of a poly(a) tail to the 3'-end of pre-mrna, is a process critical to gene expression and regulation in eukaryotes.  polyadenylation is a cotranscriptional nuclear rna processing event involving endonucleolytic cleavage of the nascent, emerging pre-messenger rna (pre-mrna) from the rna polymerase, immediately followed by the polymerization of adenine ribonucleotides, called the poly(a) tail, to the cleaved 3' end of the polyadenylation site (pas).  polyadenylate  tail addition to the 3' end of a wide range of rnas is a highly conserved modification that plays a central role in cellular rna function.  polyadenylation including the cleavage of pre-mrna and addition of a stretch of adenosines to the 3'-end is an essential step of pre-mrna processing in eukayotes.  nearly all eukaryotic messenger rnas are modified at the 3' end by the addition of an adenosine polymer: the poly-adenosine tail.  the poly(a) tail is a homopolymeric stretch of adenosine at the 3'-end of mature rna transcripts and its length plays an important role in nuclear export, stability, and translational regulation of mrna.  polyadenylation  is a vital step in post-transcriptional processing of pre-mrna.  in eukaryote genomes, the polyadenylation site marks termination of mature rna transcripts by a poly-adenine tail.  shortening of the poly(a) tail, referred to as deadenylation, reduces protein synthesis and initiates destruction of the mrna.  the stable post-translational modification of proteins by adenylylation or uridylylation was discovered more than four decades ago as a mechanism to regulate the activity of enzymes.  the polyadenylation site is recognized by a dynamic protein complex, among which the poly-adenine-binding protein nuclear1 plays a key role.  the site of polyadenylation  marks the end of a transcript, which is also the end of a gene in most cases.  antisense elements inhibiting or enhancing specific poly(a) site usage can induce desired alterations in polyadenylation, and thus hold the promise of new therapeutic approaches.  we present a survey of the historical and modern phases of research in this area, focusing on the common and differing aspects of protein adenylylation.  our study is important in highlighting novel experimental targets, which may provide new understanding about the regulatory aspects of polyadenylation.  the capacity of escherichia coli poly(a) polymerase to adenylylate the 3'-oh residue of a variety of nucleosides, nucleoside 5'-phosphates and dinucleotides of the type nucleoside(5')oligophospho(5')nucleoside is described here for the first time.  identifying dna sequence motifs that signal the addition of poly(a) tails is essential to improved genome annotation and better understanding of the regulatory mechanisms and stability of mrna.  messenger rna polyadenylation is one of the essential processing steps during eukaryotic gene expression. ||| ",no
Is pregabalin effective for sciatica?,"this study examined whether pregabalin may reduce the intensity of sciatica.  treatment with pregabalin did not significantly reduce the intensity of leg pain associated with sciatica and did not significantly improve other outcomes, as compared with placebo, over the course of 8 weeks.  we conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of pregabalin in patients with sciatica.  pregabalin is effective in the treatment of some types of neuropathic pain.  pregabalin is often used for the treatment of chronic pain syndromes.  pregabalin at reducing the development and maintenance of the neuropathic pain symptoms.  the purpose of this study was to analyze the therapeutic efficacy of pregabalin for reducing the incidence of spinal surgery for leg symptoms in patients with lumbar spinal stenosis during the first year of treatment.  pregabalin is a drug for neuropathic pain.  pregabalin is used for the treatment of neuropathic pain and has shown analgesic efficacy in post-operative pain.  pregabalin is a well-accepted treatment option for patients with neuropathic pain.  these data suggest that pregabalin reduces neuropathic pain symptoms by inhibiting the release of glutamate in the scdh.  after more than a decade of experience with pregabalin, experience and studies have shown that the adverse effect profile of pregabalin is well tolerated for the management of neuropathic pain and other conditions.  perioperative administration of pregabalin, which is effective for neuropathic pain, might reduce early postoperative and chronic pain.  along with its efficacy in particular neuropathic pain conditions, pregabalin's safety led it to be one of the first pharmacotherapies considered for the management of neuropathic pain.  pregabalin is one of the first drugs registered for the treatment of neuropathic pain.  pregabalin is recently proposed as analgesic or adjuvant in pain management.  the anti-seizure drug pregabalin is currently used for peripheral neuropathic pain, including degenerative lumbar disease with a neuropathic component.  this study demonstrated that pregabalin showed more efficacy on chronic pain than acute pain after a breast cancer surgery.  pregabalin is an anti-convulsant that successfully treats many neuropathic pain syndromes, although the mechanism of its anti-hyperalgesic action remains elusive.  however, the therapeutic efficacy of pregabalin for reducing the incidence of spinal surgery to treat leg symptoms in patients with lumbar spinal stenosis remains unknown. ||| ",no
Is pregabalin effective for treatment of patients with restless leg syndrome?,"this review summarizes the published data on the effects of pregabalin on sleep disturbance associated with neuropathic pain, fibromyalgia, restless legs syndrome, partial onset seizures and general anxiety disorder.  treatment with pregabalin results in rapid time to significant improvement in both pain and pain-related sleep interference in patients with neuropathic pain due to sci.  the data demonstrate that pregabalin has a positive benefit on sleep disturbance associated with several different clinical conditions.  the purpose of this study was to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of pregabalin in patients with leg symptoms due to lumbar spinal stenosis.  pregabalin is often used for the treatment of chronic pain syndromes.  in 2 large-scale, placebo-controlled trials, pregabalin improved both pain and pain-related sleep interference in patients with neuropathic pain due to spinal cord injury (sci).  pregabalin was also associated with significant improvements from baseline in pain-related sleep interference, and the medical outcomes study sleep scale sleep problems index and sleep disturbance subscale (all p < 0.001).  pregabalin is indicated for the treatment of fibromyalgia and pregabalin-treated subjects have shown improved pain, sleep and functional measures in placebo-controlled and open-label studies.  pregabalin is an anticonvulsant drug indicated for neuropathic disorders and fibromyalgia.  the anticonvulsant pregabalin is increasingly prescribed for pain, seizures, and psychiatric disorders.  pregabalin is effective in the treatment of peripheral and central neuropathic pain.  what is the role of pregabalin (lyrica) in the treatment of fibromyalgia?  pregabalin is a drug for neuropathic pain.  pregabalin is an anti-convulsant that successfully treats many neuropathic pain syndromes, although the mechanism of its anti-hyperalgesic action remains elusive.  pregabalin is a synthetic amino acid compound effective in clinical trials for the treatment of post-herpetic neuralgia, diabetic peripheral neuropathy, generalized anxiety disorder and adjunctive therapy for partial seizures of epilepsy.  flexible-dose pregabalin 150-600 mg/day was effective in relieving neuropathic pain, improving disturbed sleep, improving overall patient status, and was generally well tolerated in patients with post-traumatic peripheral neuropathic pain.  pregabalin is a well-accepted treatment option for patients with neuropathic pain.  the purpose of this study was to analyze the therapeutic efficacy of pregabalin for reducing the incidence of spinal surgery for leg symptoms in patients with lumbar spinal stenosis during the first year of treatment.  pregabalin is approved for the treatment of a variety of clinical conditions and its analgesic, anxiolytic and anticonvulsant properties are well documented.  however, the therapeutic efficacy of pregabalin for reducing the incidence of spinal surgery to treat leg symptoms in patients with lumbar spinal stenosis remains unknown. ||| ",yes
Is pregnancy an additional risk during during H1N1 infection?,"emerging data suggest that pregnancy conveys high risk for severe complications from the 2009 pandemic influenza a virus (2009 h1n1) infection.  evidence from previous influenza pandemics, epidemic seasonal influenza and, most recently, pandemic influenza a (h1n1) demonstrates that pregnant women and their offspring are at an increased risk for influenza-related complications.  h1n1 influenza in pregnancy can be associated with severe complications.  pandemic influenza a/h1n1 infection during pregnancy has a negative impact on several aspects of pregnancy outcome.  pregnant women are at an increased risk of influenza-associated adverse outcomes, such as premature delivery, based on data from the latest pandemic with a novel influenza a (h1n1) virus in 2009-2010.  pregnancy was identified as a major risk factor for increased mortality and morbidity due to h1n1 influenza in the pandemic of 2009 to 2010.  during the 2009 influenza a (h1n1) pandemic, pregnant women were at risk for severe influenza illness.  pregnant women infected with human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) may have particular vulnerability to 2009 pandemic h1n1 influenza (ph1n1) infection.  during pregnancy, immunological and hormonal alterations place women at increased risk for influenza-related severe illnesses including hospitalization and death.  while it is not possible to ascertain retrospectively if myocarditis was caused by either infection with h1n1 virus or as a result of pregnancy (in the absence of endomyocardial biopsies), the significant association with myocardial involvement in both women demonstrates the increased risk of exposure to h1n1 influenza virus in pregnant women.  during the 2009 influenza a (h1n1) pandemic, many pregnant women experienced severe illness and some gave birth while ill with suspected or confirmed pandemic (h1n1) 2009 influenza.  pregnant women were at increased risk for serious outcomes of 2009 pandemic influenza a virus subtype h1n1 (influenza apdm09) infection, but little is known about the overall impact of the pandemic on neonatal and maternal outcomes.  pregnant women are at increased risk for complications from seasonal influenza.  during the 2009–2010 a/h1n1 influenza pandemic, pregnant women infected with the virus experienced excess morbidity and mortality when compared with other groups.  the aim of the study was to estimate the risk factors associated with the 2009 h1n1 influenza infection, during pregnancy; to describe complications and obstetric and perinatal outcomes of pregnancies during the h1n1 pandemic in 2009; to identify if there is teratogenicity at birth after antiviral treatment.  pregnant women were considered to be at a high risk of influenza infection.  pandemic influenza virus infection in pregnancy was associated with an increased risk of fetal death.  consequently, the rates of morbidity and mortality related with h1n1 2009 infections have been reported to be higher in pregnant women.  influenza infections in pregnancy have been associated with adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes, including preterm labor and delivery, respiratory hospitalization, pneumonia, adult respiratory distress syndrome, overwhelming sepsis and death.  pregnant women had an increased risk of influenza complications in two past epidemics (1918-1919 and 1957-1958). ||| ",yes
Is progesterone effective for treatment of patients with traumatic brain injury based on clinical trial data?,"to assess the effectiveness and safety of progesterone in people with acute traumatic brain injury (tbi).  progesterone has been shown to have neuroprotective effects in multiple animal models of brain injury, whereas the efficacy and safety in patients with traumatic brain injury (tbi) remains contentious.  the benefits of progesterone have been demonstrated in the animal models of traumatic brain injury (tbi).  progesterone is a potential neuroprotective drug to treat patients with traumatic brain injury.  in the present study we focused on the effect of progesterone treatment on structural and functional deficits in an experimental model of traumatic brain injury.  to conduct a meta-analysis to determine whether progesterone, compared with placebo or no treatment, influences mortality and neurologic outcome in traumatic brain injury (tbi).  the therapeutic use of progesterone following traumatic brain injury has recently entered phase iii clinical trials as a means of neuroprotection.  early treatment of moderate/severe traumatic brain injury (tbi) with progesterone does not improve clinical outcomes.  preclinical and clinical research findings have revealed that the hormone progesterone, when acutely administered, can dramatically reduce cerebral edema, inflammation, tissue necrosis, and programmed cell death following traumatic brain injury (tbi).  given after brain injury (tbi), progesterone reduces cerebral oedema and facilitates functional recovery.  previous studies suggest that progesterone may possess neuroprotective properties after traumatic insult but, with the exception of reduced formation of cerebral oedema, limited experimental evidence has been presented to support this claim.  although the administration of progesterone has been shown to be neuroprotective in experimental models of traumatic brain injury (tbi), the mechanisms for this beneficial effect are still poorly understood.  current clinical evidence from three small rcts indicates progesterone may improve the neurologic outcome of patients suffering tbi.  current clinical evidence from three small rcts indicates progesterone may improve the neurologic outcome of patients suffering tbi.  this study provides strong evidence that progesterone possesses neuroprotective properties in a mouse model of traumatic brain injury, but suggests that the steroid achieves this effect through mechanism(s) independent of the inflammatory response or growth factor up-regulation.  the administration of progesterone as a neuroprotective agent following traumatic brain injury has recently entered phase iii clinical trials.  two multi-centre phase iii clinical trials examining the protective potential of progesterone following traumatic brain injury have recently failed to demonstrate any improvement in outcome.  the failure of phase 3 clinical trials to demonstrate the cerebroprotective efficiency of progesterone in traumatic brain injury (tbi) patients emphasizes that different aspects of the design of both experimental and clinical studies should be reviewed and refined.  our data suggest that intranasal delivery of progesterone is a potential efficient, safe and non-stressful mode of administration that warrants evaluation for cerebroprotection in patients with brain injuries.  progesterone has been shown to be cerebroprotective in different experimental models of brain injuries and neurodegenerative diseases. ||| ",no
Is propranolol used for treatment of infantile hemangioma?,"propranolol is a well tolerated and effective treatment for infantile hemangiomas.  propranolol is the treatment of choice for infantile hemangiomas requiring medical intervention.  propranolol has been successfully used recently in a limited number of children with infantile hemangioma.  here, the author presents experience with oral propranolol in treatment of 14 patients with infantile hemangiomas.  currently, oral propranolol is the treatment of choice for infantile hemangioma, but there is no consensus when it comes to its recommended dosage for this condition.  propranolol has been found to be effective in treatment of severe hemangiomas of infancy.  recent data suggest that propranolol is an effective treatment for infantile hemangiomas (ihs).  although there are a limited number of patients, these results showed that oral propranolol therapy is a safe and effective choice in the treatment of infantile hemangiomas before the age of 1 year.  propranolol has recently been introduced as a novel pharmacologic treatment for infantile hemangiomas.  twelve patients with infantile hemangioma, age ranged between 2 and 11 months, have been treated with oral propranolol for 6 months' period.  propranolol is highly effective in the treatment of infantile hemangioma (ih), but important clinical and pharmacological data are lacking.  oral propranolol at dose of 2 mg/kg/day in 2 divided doses for 24 weeks aided by gsu is shown to be a safe and effective treatment of infantile hemangioma during the proliferative phase.  recently, propranolol, a nonselective β-blocker, has become a reputed and successful treatment modality for infantile hemangiomas.  to investigate the mechanism of propranolol on regression of infantile hemangiomas.  treatment of infantile hemangiomas was revolutionized when propranolol, a nonselective β-blocker, was reported to be effective therapy.  propranolol has recently been shown to be highly effective for infantile hemangioma (ih), but the mechanism of action of propranolol and the usefulness of measurement of vascular endothelial growth factor (vegf) remain poorly understood.  propranolol is an approved non-selective β-adrenergic blocker that is first line therapy for infantile hemangioma.  in this review, we highlight the lessons learned using propranolol to treat infantile hemangiomas.  these findings provide a plausible mechanism of action of propranolol on regression of infantile hemangiomas.  propranolol has become the first-line therapy for the treatment of complicated infantile hemangioma. ||| ",yes
Is protein CXCR4 used as a prognostic marker of cancer?,"conclusions: cxcr4 may serve as a prognostic indicator in gi cancer patients.  cxcr4 protein may be a potential biomarker for liver metastasis and an independent marker for survival in colorectal cancer.  these findings suggest that serum cxcr4 levels may be a useful surrogate marker of clinical outcome in metastatic or recurrent colorectal cancer.  these studies extend the potential roles of cxcr4 in cancer to include functions associated with benign (grade 1) tumors.  the purpose of this study was to evaluate the prognostic and clinicopathological importance of cxcr4 in crc patients.  the aim of this study was to determine the prognostic value of cxcr4 expression in patients with clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (ccrcc).  increased cxcr4 expression, especially in whole cells and cytoplasm, may serve as a poor prognostic indicator in patients with breast cancer.  a high expression of cxcr4 has a prognostic significance with regard to overall and progression-free survival and offers a starting point for targeted therapies.  high expression of pcxcr4 was significantly associated with a favorable prognosis in a test and validation group (p = 0.015 and p = 0.0001).  the role of cxcr4 in cancer will depend on it being in an activated, signaling state.  our studies were designed to investigate the expression and prognostic significance of cxcr4 in patients with gastric cancer.  c-x-c chemokine receptor 4 (cxcr4) is highly expressed in cancers, contributing to proliferation, metastasis, and a poor prognosis.  cxcr4 expression was considered positive when >1% of tumor cells were stained.  by multivariate analysis, a high expression of cxcr4 appeared to be an independent factor of overall survival (p=0.024) and cancer-specific survival (p=0.028).  cxcr4 expression was found in 68/104 (65.4%) of tumor samples.  determination of the cxcr4 receptor status will provide predictive information for disease prognosis and possible therapeutic intervention.  on the basis of tnm stage, detection of cxcr4 expression will be helpful for predicting prognosis for patients with gastric cancer.  the noninvasive imaging of cxcr4 can enable the detection and characterization of aggressive cancers with poor outcomes.  the clinical significance of cxcr4 expression in colorectal cancer remains unclear.  in univariate analysis, cxcr4 was found to be associated with lymph node metastasis, tnm stage, and liver metastasis (p = 0.001, 0.001, and 0.012, respectively). ||| ",yes
Is protein Fbw7 a SCF type of E3 ubiquitin ligase?,"fbw7 (f-box and wd repeat domain-containing 7) is the substrate recognition component of an evolutionary conserved scf (complex of skp1, cul1 and f-box protein)-type ubiquitin ligase.  the f-box protein fbw7 (also known as fbxw7, hcdc4 and sel-10) functions as a substrate recognition component of a scf-type e3 ubiquitin ligase.  fbxw7 (f-box and wd repeat domain-containing 7) is the f-box protein component of a skp1-cul1-f-box protein-type (scf-type) ubiquitin ligase.  fbxw7 is a component of scf (complex of skp1, cul1 and f-box-protein)-type ubiquitin ligases that targets several oncoproteins for ubiquitination and degradation by the proteasome.  fbw7 is one of the most well characterized f-box proteins that serve as substrate recognition subunits of scf (skp1-cullin 1-f-box proteins) e3 ubiquitin ligase complexes.  f-box and wd repeat domain-containing 7 (fbxw7) is an e3-ubiquitin ligase, which serves as one of the components of the skp1, cul1, and f-box protein type ubiquitin ligase (scf) complex.  fbxo7 is the substrate-recognition component of the scffbxo7 (skp1-cul1-fbox protein) e3 ubiquitin ligase.  fbw7 is a member of f-box family proteins, which constitute one subunit of skp1, cul1, and f-box protein (scf) ubiquitin ligase complex.  f-box and wd repeat domain-containing 7 (fbw7), the substrate-binding subunit of e3 ubiquitin ligase scf(fbw7) (a complex of skp1, cullin-1 and fbw7), plays important roles in various physiological and pathological processes.  fbw7 (f-box and wd repeat domain-containing 7), also known as cdc4, ago and sel10, is the substrate recognition component of an evolutionary conserved scf (complex of skp1, cul1 and f-box protein)-type e3 ubiquitin ligase.  in scf ubiquitin ligases, a diverse array of f-box proteins confers substrate specificity.  the scf(fbw7) ubiquitin ligase complex plays important roles in cell growth, survival, and differentiation via the ubiquitin-proteasome-mediated regulation of protein stability.  f-box proteins determine the substrate specificities of scf ubiquitin ligases.  furthermore, using in vitro purified scf(fbw7) component proteins, we found that e1a directly bound to roc1/rbx1 and cul1 and that e1a inhibited the ubiquitin ligase activity of the roc1/rbx1-cul1 complex but not that of another ring-type ubiquitin ligase, mdm2.  f-box and wd-40 domain protein 7 (fbxw7) is a component of the skp1-cdc53/cullin-f-box-protein complex (scf/β-trcp), which is an e3 ubiquitin ligase that mediates protein degradation.  the f-box protein is the substrate recognition subunit of scf (skp1/cul1/f-box) e3 ubiquitin ligase complex, a multicomponent ring-type e3 ligase involved in the regulation of numerous cellular processes by targeting critical regulatory proteins for ubiquitination.  these observations demonstrated that e1a perturbs protein turnover regulated by scf(fbw7) through the inhibition of scf(fbw7) ubiquitin ligase.  the ubiquitin ligase complex scf(fbs1), which contributes to the ubiquitination of glycoproteins, is involved in the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation pathway.  f-box proteins are the substrate-recognition components of the skp1-cul1-f box protein (scf) e3 ubiquitin ligases.  taken together, these data reveal that scffbxo28 is the e3 ligase responsible for the self-ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of fbxo28, providing a new clue for the upstream signaling regulation for f-box proteins. ||| ",yes
Is protein M3/6 a dual specificity phosphatase?,"we have isolated a cdna homologous to known dual-specificity phosphatases from a mouse macrophage cdna library and termed it mkp-m (for mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase isolated from macrophages).  map kinase phosphatase 3 (mkp3, also known as dusp6 and pyst1) is involved in extracellular signal receptor kinase (erk) regulation and functions as a specific phosphatase to the activated (phosphorylated) forms of erk1 and erk2.  map kinase phosphatase (mkp)-3 is a cytoplasmic dual specificity protein phosphatase that specifically binds to and inactivates the erk1/2 map kinases in mammalian cells.  the deduced amino acid sequence of mkp-m is most similar to those of hvh-5 (or mouse m3/6) and vhp1, a caenorhabditis elegans tyrosine phosphatase.  we recently described a novel murine mkp, m3/6, which is uniquely specific for c-jun n-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase and p38 kinase.  myotubularin-related protein 1 (mtmr1) is a phosphatase that belongs to the tyrosine/dual-specificity phosphatase superfamily.  the nucleophilic cysteine residue and the adjacent histidine residue, which are conserved in all active dual-specificity phosphatases, are replaced by serine and phenylalanine residues respectively in mk-styx.  this and further structure-function analyses showed that m3 is required for catalysis by providing a water molecule as a proton donor during catalysis.  myosin phosphatase (mp) holoenzyme is a ser/thr specific enzyme, which is the member of protein phosphatase type 1 (pp1) family and composed of a pp1 catalytic subunit (pp1c/ppp1cb) and a myosin phosphatase targeting subunit (mypt1/ppp1r12a).  its activity depends on two metal ions in the catalytic site, which were identified as manganese in the bacterially expressed phosphatase.  mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase 2 (mkp2) is a member of the dual-specificity mkps that regulate map kinase signaling.  myosin phosphatase (mp) holoenzyme is a protein phosphatase-1 (pp1) type ser/thr specific enzyme that consists of a pp1 catalytic (pp1c) and a myosin phosphatase target subunit-1 (mypt1).  whereas the crystal structure of human pp2cα displayed two tightly bound mn2+ ions in the active site, recent investigations of ppm phosphatases have characterized the binding of a third, catalytically essential metal ion.  mtmr1 has been shown to use phosphatidylinositol 3-monophosphate (pi(3)p) and/or phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate (pi(3,5)p2) as substrates.  the myosin phosphatase (mp) holoenzyme is composed of a protein phosphatase type 1 (pp1) catalytic subunit and a regulatory subunit termed myosin phosphatase target subunit 1 (mypt1).  the amino-terminal noncatalytic domain of mkp-3 is both necessary and sufficient for nuclear export of the phosphatase and contains a single functional leucine-rich nuclear export signal (nes).  this suggests that the first aspartate of the motif is also the phosphorylated residue in l-3-phosphoserine phosphatase.  the myosin phosphatase (mp) composed of the catalytic subunit of type 1 protein phosphatase and myosin phosphatase target subunit isoform 1 (mypt1) was identified as the major serine/threonine phosphatase component in the platelet-cytoskeleton fraction.  protein phosphatase m (ppm) regulates key signaling pathways in prokaryotes and eukaryotes.  the gene consists of six exons. ||| ",yes
Is pseudouridine a RNA modification?,"as the most abundant rna modification, pseudouridine plays important roles in many biological processes.  pseudouridine (ψ) is a post-transcriptional rna modification that alters rna-rna and rna-protein interactions that affect gene expression.  pseudouridine is the most abundant modification found in rna.  pseudouridine (ψ) is a frequent nucleoside modification that occurs in both noncoding rnas and mrnas.  pseudouridine, an isomer of uridine, is probably the most common of many posttranscriptional rna modifications found in nature.  pseudouridine is the most abundant internal rna modification in stable noncoding rnas (ncrnas).  pseudouridine, the most abundant modified nucleoside in non-coding rnas, enhances the function of transfer rna and ribosomal rna by stabilizing the rna structure.  pseudouridine is the most prevalent rna modification and has been found in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes.  pseudouridine (5-ribosyluracil) is a ubiquitous yet enigmatic constituent of structural rnas (transfer, ribosomal, small nuclear, and small nucleolar).  currently, pseudouridine has been demonstrated in several kinds of rnas, such as small nuclear rna, rrna, trna, mrna, and small nucleolar rna.  the isomerization of uridine to pseudouridine (ψ), known as pseudouridylation, is the most abundant post-transcriptional modification of stable rnas.  pseudouridine (5-beta-d-ribofuranosyluracil, psi) is the most commonly found modified base in rna.  occurring at the uridine site and catalyzed by pseudouridine synthase, the modification has been observed in nearly all kinds of rna, including transfer rna, messenger rna, small nuclear or nucleolar rna, and ribosomal rna.  pseudouridine modification is most commonly found among various kinds of rna modification occurred in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes.  in the present review, we will first consider the available information on the functional roles of pseudouridine(s) in different rna species.  in many rna molecules, pseudouridines occur at conserved positions in functional sites.  this rna modification is introduced on the rna by site-specific transglycosylation of uridine (u), a process mediated by pseudouridine synthases.  the known molecular functions of pseudouridine, which include stabilizing rna conformations and destabilizing interactions with varied rna-binding proteins, suggest that rna pseudouridylation could have widespread effects on rna metabolism and gene expression.  messenger rnas were not known to contain pseudouridine, but artificial pseudouridylation dramatically affects mrna function--it changes the genetic code by facilitating non-canonical base pairing in the ribosome decoding centre.  the accepted structural role of pseudouridines is a reduction of the rna flexibility around the modification site. ||| ",yes
Is recommended the use of perioperative treatment with thyroid hormone therapy in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting?,"thyroid hormone modifies metabolic, immune and cardiovascular functions and has been administered perioperatively to treat a relative reduction of thyroid function in children following cardiopulmonary bypass (cpb) for correction of congenital heart disease.  to determine perioperative thyroid replacement therapy in patients with hypothyroidism, plasma total thyroxine (t4), total triiodothyroxine (t3), free t4, free t3 and thyroid-stimulating hormone levels were measured preoperatively and at 1, 2, 3, 7, and 14 days after operation in 9 patients with hypothyroidism and were compared with levels in 14 patients with normal thyroid function who underwent coronary bypass surgery.  the available evidence shows that perioperative oral thyroid hormone can significantly attenuate the postoperative decline in the serum hormone level and improve postoperative hemodynamic and prognostic parameters.  the outcome of coronary bypass surgery was analyzed in 25 patients who were on thyroxin replacement therapy for chronic thyroid disorders at the time of operation.  the question addressed was whether the use of prophylactic perioperative thyroxine therapy during cardiopulmonary bypass in the euthyroid adult patient undergoing routine cardiac surgery can result in an improved cardiac output leading to better clinical outcomes.  thyroid hormone changes and their association with global oxygen consumption were studied in low-risk patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (cabg) with and without cpb.  the treatment of hypothyroidism in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery is a difficult clinical problem.  the aim of the present study was to determine whether pretreatment with oral thyroid hormone had beneficial effects in cardiac function and morbidity and mortality after cardiac operations.  a prospective randomized and double-blind study was performed to evaluate whether perioperative triiodothyronine administration has any effect on cardiovascular performance after coronary artery bypass surgery.  however, there is conflicting evidence that prophylactic perioperative thyroxine/triiodothyronine therapy is a useful inotropic adjunct in adult patients undergoing routine cardiac surgery and whilst some studies report improved haemodynamic parameters in the immediate post-bypass period there is no evidence that its use influences postoperative morbidity, mortality or length of stay in the elective patient.  this study evaluated the effect of oral triiodothyronine (t(3)) replacement therapy, starting on the day of the surgery, on thyroid hormone concentrations and clinical outcome in high-risk patients undergoing valvular heart surgery.  in light of the known effects of thyroid hormone on atrial electrophysiology, we investigated the effects of perioperative t3 supplementation on the incidence of postoperative arrhythmias.  a meta-analysis was then conducted to determine the clinical impact of thyroid hormone replacement on cardiac function and postoperative characteristics.  cardiopulmonary bypass results in a euthyroid sick state, and recent evidence suggests that perioperative triiodothyronine (t3) supplementation may have hemodynamic benefits.  we conclude that routine thyroxin administration is all that is required for a satisfactory outcome in patients undergoing coronary bypass surgery while on thyroxin replacement therapy.  however, there has been no study assessing the effects of preoperative oral different-dose thyroid hormone on serum hormone levels and myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury (iri) after cardiac surgery.  thyroid-stimulating hormone (tsh)-suppressive therapy is recommended after surgical treatment in high-risk papillary thyroid carcinoma (ptc) patients.  triiodothyronine administration in patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass surgery is safe, may lessen the need for pharmacological (vasodilator) therapy, but may increase heart rate.  coronary bypass surgery was performed safely in patients with hypothyroidism.  perioperative administration of triiodothyronine increased cardiac output slightly and decreased systemic vascular resistance, but it had no effect on operative outcome. ||| ",no
Is recursive splicing more common in short introns?,"short intron splicing efficiency is increased by secondary structure, and we detect both canonical and non-canonical short introns.  together, these results indicate that recursive splicing is commonly used in drosophila, occurs in humans, and provides insight into the mechanisms by which some large introns are removed.  suggesting a possible function for recursive splicing, we observe that fly introns with recursive sites are spliced more accurately than comparably sized non-recursive introns.  the sequential nature of recursive splicing was confirmed by identification of lariat introns generated by splicing to and from the ratchet points.  recursive splicing, a process by which a single intron is removed from pre-mrna transcripts in multiple distinct segments, has been observed in a small subset of drosophila melanogaster introns.  recursive splicing is a process in which large introns are removed in multiple steps by re-splicing at ratchet points--5' splice sites recreated after splicing.  it has been proposed that, although sequences involved in intron recognition and splicing are mainly located in introns, exonic sequences also contribute to intron splicing.  the splicing pathway of pre-mrna introns bears similarities to that of the group ii introns, some members of which undergo self-splicing.  we conclude that short introns are abundant in the human transcriptome, and short intron splicing represents an added layer to mrna regulation.  these short introns are often alternatively spliced and are found in a variety of rnas-both mrnas and lncrnas.  recent molecular evidence supports the idea that intronic rnas can reverse splice into rna transcripts, a crucial step for an influential model of intron gain.  this review article examines the process of normal intron-exon splicing, as well as what is known about alternative splicing of human genes.  constitutively spliced introns have evolved to utilize many different splicing factors.  we find that vertebrate recursive splicing requires initial definition of an 'rs-exon' that follows the rs-site.  it is generally believed that splicing removes introns as single units from precursor messenger rna transcripts.  in addition, we introduce two potential mechanisms for intron creation, based on hybrid rna-dna reverse splicing and on template switching errors by reverse transcriptase.  the prevalence of retained introns within genes monotonically increased in the 5'-to-3' direction (more retained introns close to the 3'-end), consistent with the model of co-transcriptional splicing.  exonic nucleotides that frame introns are involved in both protein coding and splicing.  pre-mrna splicing, an essential step in eukaryotic gene expression, relies on recognition of short sequences on the primary transcript intron ends and takes place along transcription by rna polymerase ii.  similarities between rna splicing during autocatalytic excision of group ii introns and pre-mrna processing led to the hypothesis that group ii introns might be the evolutionary predecessors of spliceosomal small nuclear rnas. ||| ",no
Is rivaroxaban metabolized in kidneys?,"rivaroxaban is metabolized and cleared via the kidney and liver.  the patient was found to have increased effect of rivaroxaban due to further impairment of renal clearance caused by several renally cleared medications.  rivaroxaban, an oral, direct factor xa inhibitor, has a dual mode of elimination in humans, with two-thirds metabolized by the liver and one-third renally excreted unchanged.  rivaroxaban is cleared renally and a common side effect (1-10%) is renal impairment of unknown pathophysiology.  rivaroxaban is a novel factor 10a inhibitor, where hepatic metabolism and renal clearance account for its overall disposition.  rivaroxaban is eliminated via both metabolic degradation and renal elimination as unchanged drug.  herein, we present a case of a 68-year-old caucasian male patient who was receiving rivaroxaban (20 mg/day) for atrial flutter and had mild renal impairment.  the objective of this study was to investigate the in vivo metabolism and excretion of rivaroxaban in rats, dogs, and humans.  here, systematic construction and verification of a pbpk model of rivaroxaban, with the inclusion of a mechanistic kidney component, provided insight into the previously arcane role of oat3-mediated basolateral uptake in influencing both clinically observed renal elimination of rivaroxaban and differential extents of transporter-mediated ddis.  rivaroxaban and its metabolites were rapidly excreted; urinary excretion of radioactivity was 25 and 52%, and fecal excretion was 67 and 43% of the dose in rats and dogs, respectively.  consideration of basolateral organic anion transporter 3 (oat3)-mediated proximal tubular uptake in tandem with apical p-glycoprotein (p-gp)-mediated efflux facilitated mechanistic characterization of the renal elimination of rivaroxaban in both healthy and renal impaired patients.  a previously verified physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (pbpk) model of rivaroxaban established how its multiple pathways of elimination via both cyp3a4/2j2-mediated hepatic metabolism and organic anion transporter 3 (oat3)/p-glycoprotein-mediated renal secretion predisposes rivaroxaban to drug-drug-disease interactions (dddis) with clinically relevant protein kinase inhibitors (pkis).  as renal rivaroxaban clearance exceeds glomerular filtration rate, we suggested that active secretion by efflux transporters p-glycoprotein (mdr1) and breast cancer resistance protein (bcrp) contributes to rivaroxaban clearance.  therefore, renal and hepatic impairment may reduce rivaroxaban clearance, and medications inhibiting these clearance pathways could lead to drug-drug interactions.  this physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (pbpk) study investigated the pharmacokinetic behavior of rivaroxaban in clinical situations where drug clearance is impaired.  single doses of rivaroxaban (3 and 1 mg/kg) were administered to rats (orally/intravenously) and dogs (orally), respectively.  renal impairment is known to increase rivaroxaban-associated bleeding risk in patients.  in total, 82 to 89% of the dose administered was assigned to unchanged rivaroxaban and its metabolites in the excreta of rats, dogs, and humans.  in 8 renal transplant patients, rivaroxaban levels showed a predictable pharmacokinetic trend, both at ctrough (30-61 μg/l) and at cpeak (143-449 μg/l), with limited variability in the 25th-75th percentile range.  a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (pbpk) model was developed to simulate rivaroxaban pharmacokinetics in young (20-45 years) or older (55-65 years) subjects with normal renal function, mild, moderate and severe renal impairment, with or without concomitant use of the combined p-gp and moderate cyp3a4 inhibitor, erythromycin. ||| ",yes
Is rucaparib used for ovarian cancer treatment?,"introduction: rucaparib is increasingly being utilized for women with recurrent ovarian cancer both as treatment and maintenance therapy.  rucaparib is a drug with potential as maintenence monotherapy in ovarian cancers irrespective of genetic mutation.  to review the pharmacology, safety, efficacy, and the role of rucaparib in the treatment of relapsed, advanced ovarian cancer.  these results support further clinical evaluation of rucaparib either as a single agent or as an adjunct to chemotherapy for the treatment of sporadic ovarian cancer.  implications for practice: rucaparib was recently approved in the u.s. and european union for use as treatment or maintenance for recurrent ovarian cancer.  rucaparib as a maintenance treatment showed increased progression-free survival in patients with ovarian carcinoma who achieved a response to platinum-based chemotherapy, with an acceptable safety profile.  rucaparib appears to be a safe and effective new option in the treatment of relapsed, advanced brca1/2 mutant ovarian cancer.  rucaparib, a polyadpribose polymerase inhibitor (parpi), was approved recently for use in women with high-grade serous ovarian cancer (hgsoc).  a total of 2 phase i/ii trials and 1 phase ii trial have evaluated the safety and efficacy of oral rucaparib in ovarian cancer.  across all primary analysis groups, rucaparib significantly improved progression-free survival in patients with platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer who had achieved a response to platinum-based chemotherapy.  understanding and appropriate management of potential side effects associated with rucaparib may allow patients with ovarian cancer to continue to benefit from rucaparib treatment.  drawing on the authors' clinical experience with rucaparib, rucaparib prescribing information, and published supportive cancer care guidelines, this review discusses how to optimally manage common rucaparib-associated side effects in patients with advanced ovarian cancer in the real-world oncology setting.  phase ii and iii trials have documented that rucaparib has single-agent antitumor activity in patients with high-grade ovarian carcinoma, with both brca-mutated (germline and somatic) and with homologous recombination deficiency (hrd).  rucaparib, a poly(adp-ribose) polymerase inhibitor, has anticancer activity in recurrent ovarian carcinoma harbouring a brca mutation or high percentage of genome-wide loss of heterozygosity.  ovarian cancer patients with highly malignant tumors and relapses on platinum based chemotherapy exhibited statistically significant reductions in tumor size with maintenance rucaparib therapy vis a vis placebo.  here, we investigate the potential role of the parp inhibitor rucaparib (co-338, formerly known as ag014699 and pf-01367338) for the treatment of sporadic ovarian cancer.  in the current study we investigated the inhibitory effect of rucaparib (rubraca®) on human ovarian cancer skov3 and a2780 cells and its possible mechanism.  in ariel3 (nct01968213), the poly(adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase inhibitor rucaparib significantly improved progression-free survival versus placebo regardless of biomarker status when used as maintenance treatment for recurrent ovarian cancer.  treatment options for women with recurrent ovarian cancer who have received two or more prior lines of chemotherapy have recently expanded with the u.s. food and drug administration (fda) and european commission (ec) approvals of the poly(adp-ribose) polymerase (parp) inhibitor rucaparib.  in this trial we assessed rucaparib versus placebo after response to second-line or later platinum-based chemotherapy in patients with high-grade, recurrent, platinum-sensitive ovarian carcinoma. ||| ",yes
Is scuba diving safe during pregnancy?,"basic diving physiology is reviewed and the implications of scuba diving during pregnancy are discussed.  this article provides an overview of safety issues associated with basic scuba diving and offers guidance to practitioners about how to evaluate and counsel pregnant women about the associated maternal and fetal risks.  in addition to established risks of scuba diving, pregnant women are at increased risk due to changes in body habitus (affecting equipment fitting and balance).  in general, women should be cautioned to avoid diving during pregnancy, but inadvertent exposure to recreational diving in early pregnancy is not a reason for pregnancy termination.  snorkeling can still be practiced during pregnancy, but scuba diving should be discontinued until after the birth period.  obstetrical care providers may occasionally encounter women with questions about the safety of self-contained underwater breathing apparatus (scuba) diving in pregnancy.  scuba diving during pregnancy has increased in incidence as a result of substantial growth in the number of young females attracted to sport diving.  it appears that the safest choice during pregnancy is to avoid diving; however, if the woman dove when she did not know she was pregnant, there is usually a normal outcome.  five retrospective studies and one prospective study assessing the antenatal and postnatal outcomes of women who participated in scuba diving while pregnant were reviewed.  it is prudent to advise pregnant patients of the increased risk of diving problems for the fetus during pregnancy.  publications regarding reports of diving injury in pregnant humans are also reviewed, comprising very recent material from the sport diving community.  if a women insists on diving during pregnancy, she should go to a depth of only 60 ft, and duration of her dive should be half that recommended by navy dive table times.  the authors' experience with scuba diving together with a background in obstetrics allowed themes to be explored and recommendations developed.  however, pregnant females should refrain from diving, because the fetus is not protected from decompression problems and is at risk of malformation and gas embolism after decompression disease.  swimming during pregnancy is recommended.  a literature review examined available animal and human data about the potential adverse effects of the physiological changes of pregnancy on divers, the impact of pressure changes during diving, and possible consequences of hyperbaric gas exposure and rapid decompression on mother and fetus.  we investigated any potential link between diving while pregnant and fetal abnormalities by evaluating field data from retrospective study no.1 (1990/2) and prospective study no.2 (1996/2000).  he stresses that pregnant women and women who are trying to become pregnant should not dive.  those same professional organizations do not recommend diving during pregnancy because of the potential adverse outcomes that have been observed in the animal model.  scuba diving is an increasingly popular sport among women of childbearing age. ||| ",no
Is selenium deficiency involved in autoimmune thyroid disease?,"selenium deficiency, along with genetic predisposition and environmental factors, may have a role in thyroid autoimmunity.  selenium, as an antioxidant, has been implicated in the development of autoimmune thyroiditis (ait).  to study the effect of selenium supplementation in patients with autoimmune thyroid disease.  selenium status appears to have an impact on the development of thyroid pathologies.  the association between selenium and inflammation and the relevance of selenoproteins in follicular thyroid cell physiology have pointed to a putative role of selenoproteins in the pathogenesis of autoimmune thyroid diseases.  selenium (se) deficiency has been implicated in the pathogenesis of hashimoto's thyroiditis (ht), although the available evidence is limited.  the aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of selenium on the incidence and severity of ait, titers of thyroid autoantibodies, and selenoprotein expression in thyroid in a spontaneous autoimmune thyroiditis (sat) model.  selenium substitution has a significant impact on inflammatory activity in thyroid-specific autoimmune disease.  although our data present slightly higher selenium levels in normal persons than in patients with ait, this weak and statistically insignificant trend is not sufficient to support the conclusion of a link between inadequate selenium supply and autoimmune thyroid disease.  recent clinical studies have demonstrated the suppressive effect of selenium (se) treatment on serum thyroid-specific antibody titers in patients with autoimmune thyroiditis (ait), but the mechanism underlying this process is not clear.  se deficiency is associated with increased risk of thyroid disease.  this study is the first to uncover that coexisting se-deficiency and elevated iodine in ht may enhance autoimmune reactions and accelerate the deterioration of thyroid function through oxidative stress.  the aim of the study was to evaluate the role of selenium (se) in childhood autoimmune thyroiditis regarding its effect on thyroid-stimulating hormone (tsh), free thyroxine (ft4), thyroid peroxidase antibodies (tpoab), thyroglobulin antibody (tgab), and thyroid morphology.  our results showed a weak negative correlation between se and antithyroid antibodies, suggesting that selenium supplementation may improve the course of thyroid autoimmunity.  in adults, selenium supplementation decreases thyroid peroxidase antibody (tpo ab) concentrations in patients with autoimmune thyroiditis (ait).  in areas with severe selenium deficiency higher incidence of thyroiditis has been reported due to a decreased activity of selenium-dependent glutathione peroxidase enzyme within thyroid cells.  selenium (se) is a trace element that plays key roles in thyroid physiology.  selenium (se) is a critical element in thyroid function, and variable dietary se intake influences immunity.  many studies showed selenium supplementation could decrease thyroid autoantibodies in patients with ait.  there appeared to be a positive correlation between the decreased rate of selenium levels and ft4/ft3 ratio, thereby indicating that patients with severe selenium deficiency also exhibited abnormal thyroid hormone levels. ||| ",yes
Is selumetinib effective in thyroid cancer?,"selumetinib is a promising and interesting targeted therapy agent as it may reverse radioiodine uptake in patients with radioiodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer.  selumetinib caused a significant reduction of cell viability in all thyroid cancer cell lines.  the selimetry trial (eudract no 2015-002269-47) aims to investigate the role of the mek inhibitor selumetinib in resensitizing advanced iodine refractory differentiated thyroid cancer to radioiodine therapy.  the mek (mitogen-activated protein kinase)⁻inhibitor selumetinib led to increased radioiodine uptake and retention in a subgroup of patients suffering from radioiodine refractory differentiated thyroid cancer (rr-dtc).  this suggests that sodium selenite may serve as a therapeutic option for advanced thyroid cancer.  to evaluate the tolerability and efficacy of sorafenib in patients with thyroid carcinoma.  selumetinib (azd6244, arry-142886), a mitogen activated protein kinases (mek1 and 2) inhibitor, has been granted orphan drug designation for differentiated thyroid cancer.  we conduct this meta- analysis to compare the efficacy and safety of selumetinib with current therapies in patients with advanced cancer.  sorafenib has emerged as an effective therapeutic option for radioactive iodine (rai)-refractory, locally advanced or metastatic differentiated thyroid cancer (dtc).  though the use of sorafenib in the treatment of radioiodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer is considered promising by most physicians working in this field, more effective agents with less toxicity and cost are still needed.  sorafenib (sor) is recommended for the treatment of advanced or radioiodine-refractory thyroid cancer.  this study demonstrates that sorafenib is tolerable at reduced doses over prolonged periods of time in patients with thyroid cancer.  we aimed to analyse the effect of selumetinib on the expression of sodium iodide symporter (nis; slc5a5) and associated mirnas in thyroid cancer cells.  our findings provide support for the clinical evaluation of everolimus and pasireotide in thyroid cancer and other neuroendocrine tumors.  our data demonstrated that sodium selenite exhibits strong anticancer effects against thyroid cancer cells, which involved ros-mediated inhibition of the akt/mtor pathway.  tyrosine kinase inhibitors (tki) have shown clinical effectiveness in iodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer (dtc).  compared with current chemotherapy, selumetinib has modest clinical activity as monotherapy in patients with advanced cancer, but combinations of selumetinib with cytotoxic agents in patients with braf or kras mutations hold great promise for cancer treatment.  compared with current therapies, treatment schedules with selumetinib did not improve progression free survival (hazard ratio, 0.91; 95%ci 0.70-1.17, p= 0.448), but did identify better clinical benefits (odds ratio, 1.24; 95%ci 0.69- 2.24, p = 0.472) and less disease progression (hazard ratio, 0.72; 95%ci 0.51-1.00, p = 0.052) though its impact was not statistically significant.  selumetinib treatment caused an increase of radioiodine uptake, which was significant in tpc1 cells.  patients with progressive locally advanced/metastatic medullary thyroid carcinoma (mtc), or differentiated thyroid carcinoma (dtc) with non-radioiodine-avid disease, were treated with sorafenib 400 mg twice daily until disease progression. ||| ",yes
Is shotgun lipidomics the direct infusion of a lipid sample into a mass spectrometer?,"shotgun lipidomics is an analytical approach for large-scale and systematic analysis of the composition, structure, and quantity of cellular lipids directly from lipid extracts of biological samples by mass spectrometry.  shotgun lipidomics relies on the direct infusion of total lipid extracts into a high resolution tandem mass spectrometer.  shotgun lipidome profiling relies on direct mass spectrometric analysis of total lipid extracts from cells, tissues or organisms and is a powerful tool to elucidate the molecular composition of lipidomes.  direct infusion-based shotgun lipidomics is one of the most powerful and useful tools in comprehensive analysis of lipid species from lipid extracts of various biological samples with high accuracy/precision.  over the past decade, mass spectrometry (ms)-based ""shotgun lipidomics"" has emerged as a powerful tool for quantitative and qualitative analysis of the complex lipids in the biological system.  shotgun lipidomics is one of the most powerful tools in analysis of cellular lipidomes in lipidomics, which directly analyzes lipids from lipid extracts of diverse biological samples with high accuracy/precision.  multi-dimensional mass spectrometry-based shotgun lipidomics (mdms-sl) is a well-developed technology for global lipid analysis, which identifies and quantifies individual lipid molecular species directly from lipid extracts of biological samples.  top-down shotgun lipidomics relies on direct infusion of total lipid extracts into a high-resolution tandem mass spectrometer and implies that individual lipids are recognized by their accurately determined m/z.  matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-mass spectrometry imaging (maldi-msi) of lipids is considered one of the shotgun lipidomic techniques that explores the in situ distribution of lipids in tissue sections.  shotgun lipidomics is a well-suited approach to monitor lipid alterations due to its ability to scan for varying lipid types on a global, class and individual species level.  shotgun lipidomics has recently gained popularity for lipid analysis.  shotgun lipid analysis based on electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (esi-ms/ms) is increasingly used in lipidomic studies.  multi-dimensional mass spectrometry-based shotgun lipidomics (mdms-sl) has made profound advances for comprehensive analysis of cellular lipids.  technological advances in mass spectrometry and meticulous method development have produced several shotgun lipidomic approaches capable of characterizing lipid species by direct analysis of total lipid extracts.  shotgun lipidomics exploits the unique chemical and physical properties of lipid classes and individual molecular species to facilitate the high-throughput analysis of a cellular lipidome on a large scale directly from the extracts of biological samples.  the method of choice for sensitive detection and quantitation of molecular lipid species is mass spectrometry, either by direct infusion (shotgun lipidomics) or coupled with liquid chromatography.  to increase the throughput nature of shotgun lipidomics, an automated shotgun lipidomics approach is described utilizing conventional low flow gradient liquid chromatography (lc) analysis (post-injection) coupled with multiple sample injections per sample (on a lipid scan per injection basis).  this article reviews the strategies (such as modifier addition, prefractionation, chemical derivatization, charge feature utilization) that have been employed to improve/eliminate these limitations in modern shotgun lipidomics approaches (e.g., high mass resolution mass spectrometry-based and multidimensional mass spectrometry-based shotgun lipidomics).  electrospray ionization mass spectrometry is used in lipidomics studies.  as cancer research deepens at the level of quantitative biology and metabolomics, the demand for lipidomics approaches such as shotgun lipidomics is becoming greater. ||| ",yes
Is signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT3) critical for tumor angiogenesis progression?,"signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (stat3) is constitutively activated in diverse human cancers and plays a critical role in tumor cell survival, proliferation, migration, invasion, angiogenesis, and inhibition of apoptosis.  signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (stat3) is constitutively activated in many different types of cancer and plays a pivotal role in tumor growth and metastasis.  overall, this review provides mechanistic insights for the roles of stat3 signaling in tumor angiogenesis.  the signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (stat-3) can facilitate cancer progression and metastasis by being constitutively active via various signaling.  previous studies revealed that activation of stat3 promotes tumor angiogenesis.  signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (stat3) is a transcription factor that is activated in diverse human tumors and may play a direct role in malignant transformation.  because signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (stat3) is constitutively activated in most human solid tumors and is involved in the proliferation, angiogenesis, immune evasion, and antiapoptosis of cancer cells, researchers have focused on stat3 as a target for cancer therapy.  activation of the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (stat3) is frequently detected in many cancer types.  stat3 plays an important role in tumor angiogenesis, immunity and tumor invasion and metastasis.  stat3 controls cell differentiation, proliferation, and survival, and is associated with angiogenesis and immune dysfunction during tumorigenesis.  signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (stat3) represent a transcription factor that is constitutively activated in various cancers.  signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (stat3) is persistently activated in a wide variety of epithelial cancers.  signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (stat3) have roles in various cellular processes, including angiogenesis, apoptosis, cell cycle progression, cell migration and drug resistance.  numerous studies have shown that stat3 plays crucial roles in cell proliferation and survival, angiogenesis, tumor-promoting inflammation, and suppression of antitumor host immune response in the tumor microenvironment.  activated stat3 may participate in oncogenesis by stimulating cell proliferation and resisting apoptosis, as well as promoting tumor angiogenesis, invasion, and migration.  it has been demonstrated that stat3 is constitutively activated in many tumors, playing a role in carcinogenesis and tumor progression.  as an oncogene, over-activated signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (stat3) has been detected in many tumors.  aberrant activation of the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (stat3) occurs in many human tumors.  the transcription factor signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (stat3) can promote cancer metastasis, but its underlying regulatory mechanisms in gastric cancer cell invasiveness still remain obscure.  it appears that, although stat3 is not absolutely required for tumor formation, tumors that develop in the presence of stat3 become dependent on its expression for their survival, making it a potential therapeutic target. ||| ",yes
Is siltuximab effective for Castleman disease?,"in practice, the only available trial suggests that siltuximab has a marked impact on the symptoms of mild or moderate multicentric castleman's disease in patients who are not infected with hiv or hhv-8.  siltuximab is the only us food and drug administration-approved treatment for idiopathic multicentric castleman disease (imcd), a rare haematological disorder associated with substantial morbidity and mortality.  siltuximab plus best supportive care was superior to best supportive care alone for patients with symptomatic multicentric castleman's disease and well tolerated with prolonged exposure.  siltuximab (il6 antibody) is approved for the treatment of multicentric castleman disease (mcd).  siltuximab is a chimeric monoclonal antibody targeting interleukin-6 (il-6), which in the fall of 2014 became the first fda-approved treatment of the rare disease idiopathic multicentric castleman's disease (mcd).  siltuximab (sylvant™), an interleukin (il)-6 chimeric immunoglobulin gк monoclonal antibody, is a currently the only agent approved to treat human idiopathic (herpesvirus-8 negative) multicentric castleman disease (imcd), which is a rare lymphoproliferative disorder.  we assessed the safety and efficacy of siltuximab-a chimeric monoclonal antibody against interleukin 6-in hiv-negative patients with multicentric castleman's disease.  siltuximab, a monoclonal antibody that antagonises interleukin-6, has been authorised in the european union for patients with multicentric castleman's disease who are not infected with hiv or hhv-8.  these interim results strongly suggest that siltuximab is an effective treatment with favorable safety for the management of cd.  the efficacy of siltuximab in mcd is mainly confined to systemic symptomatic response and quality of life benefits with minimal complete responses and approximately 30 % partial responses, by radiographic criteria.  siltuximab is an important new treatment option for this disease.  siltuximab treatment therefore is important in the overall treatment of this rare disease state.  in clinical trials in patients with imcd, siltuximab reduced levels of c-reactive protein (a biomarker for il-6), and provided clinical responses.  although siltuximab induces a response in a significant proportion of imcd patients via interleukin 6 (il6) neutralization, it is not universally effective.  siltuximab is a new anti-il-6, chimeric monoclonal antibody with potential therapeutic benefit in patients with cd.  in the absence of a cure, siltuximab represents a significant achievement in the management of this difficult-to-treat orphan disease.  this review focuses on the clinical development and pharmaceutical approval of siltuximab.  intravenous siltuximab 12 mg/kg every 3 weeks.  relative to placebo, the addition of siltuximab to best supportive care improved tumor- and symptom-related outcomes, with patients also reporting improvements in mcd symptoms, functional status, and well-being.  our model suggests that imcd patients with laboratory evidence of an inflammatory syndrome are the best candidates for siltuximab therapy. ||| ",yes
Is single-cell analysis (SCA) possible in proteomics?,"single cell proteomics is an emerging field of bioanalysis allowing one to capture proteome profiles of isolated single cells, which is expected to yield additional biological information in comparison with bulk cell analysis.  single cell analytics for proteomic analysis is considered a key method in the framework of systems nanobiology which allows a novel proteomics without being subjected to ensemble-averaging, cell-cycle, or cell-population effects.  single cell analysis (sca) has gained increased popularity for elucidating cellular heterogeneity at genomic, proteomic and cellular levels.  mass spectrometry-based proteomics is actively embracing quantitative, single-cell level analyses.  proteomics at single-cell resolution can help to identify the heterogeneity among cell populations, shows more and more significance in current chemistry and biology.  indeed, recent advances in sample preparation and mass spectrometry (ms) have enabled the emergence of quantitative ms-based single-cell proteomics (scp).  in single cell analysis (sca), individual cell-specific properties and inhomogeneous cellular responses are being investigated that is not subjected to ensemble-averaging or heterogeneous cell population effects.  quantification of single-cell proteomics provides key insights in the field of cellular heterogeneity.  single-cell proteomics represents a field of extremely sensitive proteomic analysis, owing to the minute amount of yet complex proteins in a single cell.  single cell mass spectrometry (scms) enables sensitive detection and accurate analysis of broad ranges of cellular species on the individual-cell level.  we believed that sccp would be one of the powerful alternatives for proteomics at single-cell resolution.  for proteomic single cell analysis, ultra-sensitive and reproducible separation and detection techniques are essential.  single-cell proteomics by mass spectrometry (scope-ms) is a recently introduced method to quantify multiplexed single-cell proteomes.  the advancement in technologies for single cell isolation, amplification of genome/transcriptome and next-generation sequencing enables scs to reveal the inherent properties of a single cell from the large scale of the genome, transcriptome or epigenome at high resolution.  single-cell sequencing (scs) is a promising new technique used to assess the genomics, transcriptomics, epigenetics, and other multi-omics at the single-cell level.  without amplification potential as of nucleic acids, single-cell mass spectrometry (ms) analysis demands special instrumentation running with optimized parameters to maximize the sensitivity and throughput for comprehensive proteomic discovery.  meanwhile, microfluidic single cell analysis (msca) exhibits integration, miniaturization, and high throughput, which can considerably improve the efficiency of single-cell analysis.  in this work, we demonstrated a new single cell chemical proteomic (sccp) strategy with a membrane-permeable activity-based probe (abp) to characterize the functional proteins in lysosome located in the cytosol.  single-cell metabolomics (scm) is currently one of the most powerful tools for performing high-throughput metabolic analysis at the cellular level.  single cell rna sequencing (scrna-seq) is applied to assay the individual transcriptomes of large numbers of cells. ||| ",no
Is skin color affected by variations of the SLC24A5 gene?,"a non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphism in the human slc24a5 gene is associated with natural human skin color variation.  a variant allele of slc24a5, the gene encoding nckx5, has been shown to correlate with lighter skin pigmentation in humans, indicating a key role for slc24a5 in determining human skin colour.  solute carrier family 24 member 5 (slc24a5) is a gene that is associated with oculocutaneous albinism type 6 (oca6) disorder and is involved in skin and hair pigmentation.  the slc24a5 gene, the human orthologue of the zebrafish golden gene, has been shown to play a key role in human pigmentation.  similar to morphants, homozygous slc24a5ko mutants had significantly reduced melanin content and pigmentation.  deficient slc24a5 activity results in oculocutaneous albinism (oca) type 6 in humans.  variants of the slc24a5 gene, which encodes a putative potassium-dependent sodium-calcium exchanger (nckx5) that most likely resides in the melanosome or its precursor, affect pigmentation in both humans and zebrafish (danio rerio).  slc24a5, encoding a potent k+ -dependent na+ /ca2+ exchanger, is among the known color-coding genes that participate in melanogenesis by maintaining ph in melanosomes.  slc45a2 mutations cause oculocutaneous albinism type 4 (oca4) and polymorphisms are associated with pigmentation variation, but the localization, function, and regulation of slc45a2 and its variants remain unknown.  knockdown analyses have shown slc24a5 to be important for pigmentation, but to date the function of this ion exchanger in melanogenesis has not been fully established.  twenty-two variants (single nucleotide polymorphisms - snps) of the genes involved in hair pigmentation (oca2, herc2, mc1r, slc24a5, slc45a2, tpcn2, tyr, tyrp1) were genotyped in a group of 186 polish participants, representing a range of hair colours (45 red, 64 blond, 77 dark).  this finding suggests that genetic variations influencing human skin pigmentation alter melanosome biogenesis via ionic changes.  our findings illustrate significant variation worldwide at slc6a4 and that the functionally implicated alleles at the snps rs25531, rs25532, and rs6355 occur on limited haplotypes and vary significantly in global distribution.  our data suggest that slc45a2 maintains melanosome neutralization that is initially orchestrated by transient oca2 activity to support melanization at late stages of melanosome maturation, and that a common allelic variant imparts reduced activity due to protein instability.  the results are consistent with a previous finding and in accord with most of the results obtained in caucasian subjects that slc6a4 genotype is not related, at least by itself, to a response to treatment in either ethnic group to any clinically significant degree.  moreover, the light skin-associated slc45a2 allelic f374 variant restores only moderate pigmentation to slc45a2-deficient melanocytes due to rapid proteasome-dependent degradation resulting in lower protein expression levels in melanosomes than the dark skin-associated allelic l374 variant.  slc24a5 expression has been found to be elevated in melanoma.  slc24a5 is expressed in the melanophores as they differentiate from the neural crest and develop in the rpe of the eye.  in conclusion, common variation in the slc22a3 gene is unlikely to significantly contribute to pancreatic cancer risk.  skin pigmentation is a highly heterogeneous trait with diverse consequences worldwide. ||| ",yes
Is sonidegib effective for basal cell carcinoma?,"sonidegib is a hedgehog pathway inhibitor approved to treat locally advanced basal cell carcinoma and, depending on regulatory approval, metastatic basal cell carcinoma.  sonidegib, a hedgehog pathway inhibitor, was approved by the us fda for the treatment of locally advanced basal cell carcinoma which cannot be readily treated with surgery or radiotherapy.  sonidegib selectively inhibits smoothened protein, suppresses the growth of hedgehog pathway-dependent tumors, and has recently been approved in the indication of locally advanced basal cell carcinoma.  sonidegib, approved for the treatment of labcc on the basis of the results of the basal cell carcinoma outcomes with lde225 treatment study, demonstrated rapid efficacy and a manageable safety profile.  sonidegib, also known as lde225, is an orally available smo antagonist that was recently approved by the us fda for the treatment of patients with locally advanced basal cell carcinoma.  this analysis evaluated the impact of sonidegib dose reductions and interruptions in patients with advanced basal cell carcinoma through 42 months.  the hedgehog pathway disrupting drug sonidegib is used in the treatment of basal cell carcinoma.  although vismodegib and sonidegib have demonstrated effectiveness for the treatment of basal cell carcinoma (bcc), their clinical use has been associated with mutation-related drug resistance.  sonidegib and vismodegib are hedgehog pathway inhibitors (hhis) approved for the treatment of advanced basal cell carcinoma (bcc).  to assess the tumor response to the smoothened (smo) inhibitor, sonidegib (lde225), in patients with an advanced basal cell carcinoma (bcc) resistant to treatment with vismodegib (gdc0449).  sonidegib (odomzo®), an oral smoothened (smo) antagonist, is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with locally advanced basal cell carcinoma (labcc) who present recurrence following surgery or radiation therapy, or those who are not candidates for surgery or radiotherapy.  vismodegib and sonidegib are the two oral smoothened (smo) inhibitors approved for the treatment of advanced basal cell carcinoma.  metastatic basal cell carcinoma may be treated with hedgehog pathway inhibitors, including vismodegib and sonidegib.  we describe a man with metastatic basal cell carcinoma who did not respond well to vismodegib and sonidegib.  in this review, we summarize the main findings on the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of sonidegib and discuss the management of locally advanced bcc with this drug.  the bolt study for sonidegib, a hedgehog pathway inhibitor (hhi) approved for patients with locally advanced basal cell carcinoma (labcc) not amenable to curative surgery or radiotherapy, used modified response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (mrecist) for labcc tumor evaluation.  two patients with 3 large and aggressive basal cell carcinomas were treated with vismodegib for 6 months.  neoadjuvant therapy with vismodegib for 6 months prior to mohs surgery was effective in reducing the size of primary and recurrent aggressive basal cell carcinoma.  sonidegib has recently been approved and now presents an alternative treatment option.  although treatment of patients with basal cell carcinoma with vismodegib has been associated with partial or complete clinical response, it is still unclear if it is also associated with histological cure. ||| ",yes
Is statin use associated with improved outcomes after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage?,"this meta-analysis aimed to investigate the efficacy of statins for patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage.  objective the efficacy of statin therapy in treating aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (sah) remains controversial.  a recent meta-analysis investigating the efficacy of statin treatment in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage reported a reduced incidence of vasospasm, delayed cerebral ischemia, and mortality in statin-treated patients.  vasospasm is one of the most common complications after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage.statins have been proven to be effective to reduce the incidence of vasospasm both in experimental subarachnoid hemorrhage and several clinical trials before.  to evaluate the evidence for use of hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme a reductase inhibitors (statins) for the prevention and management of cerebral vasospasm after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (asah).  to determine whether preadmission statin use in patients with spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage (sah) is associated with improved functional outcomes and a lower incidence of delayed cerebral ischemic events compared with statin-naive patients with sah.  summary of review- all randomized, placebo-controlled trials investigating the effect of statins on vasospasm, delayed cerebral ischemia, and functional outcome in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage were included.  statins have pleiotropic effects that are considered beneficial in preventing cerebral vasospasm and delayed cerebral ischemia after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (asah).  simvastatin might be beneficial to the patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage.  the results of the present systematic review do not lend statistically significant support to the finding of a beneficial effect of statins in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage as reported in a previous meta-analysis.  we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to explore the efficacy of simvastatin for aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage.  in this meta-analysis, the authors investigated whether statin treatment significantly reduced the incidence of cerebral vasospasm and delayed neurological deficits, promoting a better outcome after aneurysmal sah.  the authors hypothesized that statin therapy after coil embolization or surgical clipping of cerebral aneurysms might improve clinical outcomes.  consistent statin therapy was significantly associated with better prognosis after coil embolization or surgical clipping of cerebral aneurysms.  randomized controlled trials (rcts) assessing the effect of simvastatin versus placebo on aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage were included.  statins have been shown to reduce mortality and morbidity in ischemic stroke, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and traumatic brain injuries, but their effect on intracerebral hemorrhage (ich) remains to be determined.  no benefits of statins-use for patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage were observed in both rcts and observational studies, which was quite different from the results of several previous meta-analysis.  accumulating evidence suggests that statins exert neuroprotective effects, but whether their use affects the outcomes of intracerebral hemorrhage (ich) remains controversial.  conclusions treatment with statins significantly decreased the occurrence of vasospasm after aneurysmal sah.  this study aimed to investigate the effect of prior statin use on survival following spontaneous primary intracerebral hemorrhage in a multi-ethnic asian population. ||| ",yes
Is sternotomy closure done using either a sternal ZipFix™ implant  or conventional steel wire following cardiac surgery?,"to determine the difference in sternal infection and other infectious events between conventional wire and cable-tie-based closure techniques post-sternotomy in a collective of patients after cardiac surgery.  in a large cohort of consecutive cardiac operations, it was found that sternal closure with figure-of-8 wires is better than closure with simple interrupted wires.  a prospective, randomized study compared the zipfix (de puy synthes, west chester, pa) sternal closure system (n = 58) with standard stainless steel wires (n = 60).  zipfix sternal cable ties provide reliable closure but no demonstrable benefit in this study in pain or analgesic requirements relative to standard wire closure after median sternotomy.  the sternotomy incision is predominantly closed with either steel wire or polyester suture.  observational register study with 7835 patients having sternal closure with figure-of-8 steel wires was compared with 2122 patients, where the sternotomy was closed by simple interrupted straight wires.  use of stainless steel wires in median sternotomy closure is at times associated with serious complications.  the most common material used for closure of median sternotomy incision is steel suture in open heart surgery.  conventional stainless steel wire is passed through the cannula of each screw and the sternotomy is closed in the usual manner.  stainless steel wires are still commonly used as a sternum closure technique.  standard steel wires (n: 51) used for sternotomy were compared with the sternal cable (n: 49).  we sought to compare the effects of conventional wire cerclage with that of the band and plate fixation of the sternum.  in contrast to conventional sternal closure, in which sternal wires are passed through the intercostal space, the novel technique in sternal closure passes sternal wires transcostally or through costo-chondral joints.  we describe an alternative way for complicated sternal closure by using a rigid sternal fixation system that is feasible for cardiac surgeons.  these initial cases prove the safety and efficacy of the sternal talon device for sternum closure in high-risk patients and may be regarded as an alternative to conventional wire closure.  nickel allergy can raise clinical problems in patients undergoing cardiac surgery who require sternal closure with stainless steel wire.  application of steel wires has been the preferred method of closure.  in this prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trial, intracutaneous and transcutaneous suture techniques for closing the sternum were compared with respect to postoperative sternal wound infections and cosmetic results.  traditionally, the sternum is closed with stainless steel wires.  153 sternal closures were performed with monofilament absorbable suture material in a period of seven months at the koşuyolu heart and research hospital. ||| ",yes
Is stop codon bypass possible?,"this review focuses on the mechanisms of stop codon readthrough, the nucleotide and protein environments that facilitate or inhibit it, and the therapeutic interest of stop codon readthrough in the treatment of genetic diseases caused by nonsense mutations.  stop codon readthrough may be promoted by the nucleotide environment or drugs.  under certain conditions, the stop codon can be recognized as a coding codon promoting translation, which then terminates at a later stop codon.  thus, except for the few cases with demonstrated functions, stop-codon read-through is generally nonadaptive.  stop-codon read-through refers to the phenomenon that a ribosome goes past the stop codon and continues translating into the otherwise untranslated region (utr) of a transcript.  it was proposed that if some mrna characteristics resulted in a low efficiency of termination signal, an additional closely located stop codon (tandem stop codons) could be used to prevent the harmful readthrough.  here we propose and test a competing hypothesis that stop-codon read-through arises mostly from molecular errors and is largely nonadaptive.  single nucleotide substitutions can destroy the existing stop codon, leading to uninterrupted translation up to the next stop codon in the gene's reading frame, or create a premature stop codon via a nonsense mutation.  two competing events, termination and readthrough (or nonsense suppression), can occur when a stop codon reaches the a-site of a translating ribosome.  if it is assumed that mutations to stop codons are lethal then those codons which can mutate in one step to a stop codon tend to be used less frequently.  this event, called stop codon readthrough, occurs either by error, due to a dedicated regulatory environment leading to generation of different protein isoforms, or through the action of a readthrough compound.  our results indicate that these premature stop codons in ste6p can be suppressed at frequencies as high as 10%.  where trna suppressors of nonsense codons are present, both the efficiency of suppression and of the termination process appear to be affected by stop codon context.  alternatively, readthrough, in which the stop codon is erroneously decoded by a suppressor or near cognate transfer rna (trna), results in translation past the stop codon and production of a protein with a c-terminal extension.  the sequence around stop codons strongly affects termination efficiency and the probability of alternative events to termination such as frameshifting and stop codon readthrough.  wide ranging studies of the readthrough of translational stop codons within the last 25 years have suggested that the stop codon might be only part of the molecular signature for recognition of the termination signal.  however, stop codon readthrough can occur when a near-cognate trna outcompetes erf1 in decoding the stop codon, resulting in the continuation of the elongation phase of protein synthesis.  highly expressed genes show clear preferences among stop codons and their contexts, whereas inefficient stop signals are exploited in a variety of recoding processes.  recognition of the stop codon by the translation machinery is essential to terminating translation at the right position and to synthesizing a protein of the correct size.  stop codon readthrough (scr) occurs when the ribosome miscodes at a stop codon. ||| ",yes
Is subacute sclerosing panencephalitis caused by the Measles vaccine?,"when measles vaccines were widely introduced in the 1970s, there were concerns that they might cause subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (sspe): a very rare, late-onset, neurological complication of natural measles infection.  subacute sclerosing panencephalitis, a rare, progressive, fatal central nervous system disease of children, is caused by measles virus.  subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (sspe) is related to ""defective"" measles virus or vaccination, though an association with parainfluenza viruses has been reported.  measles virus has been suggested to cause subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (sspe), a slow central nervous system disease of children.  subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (sspe), in the majority of cases, is caused by the wild measles virus, although there are some reports relating sspe to vaccination.  subacute sclerosing panencephalitis is a fatal degenerative disease and, although it had largely disappeared because of nearly universal measles vaccination, it still remains a serious infection among children affected by human immunodeficiency virus (hiv).  subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (sspe) is a fatal complication of measles infection.  subacute sclerosing panencephalitis is a form of chronic persistent measles encephalitis in childhood which rarely manifests after wild virus infection.  subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (sspe) is a chronic encephalitis occurring after infection with measles virus.  subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (sspe) is a rare, non-treatable and fatal neurological complication of measles, still present due to the return of the epidemic linked to the loosening of vaccination policies.  subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (sspe) is a chronic central nervous (cns) system infection caused by measles virus.  subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (sspe) is a slowly progressive brain disorder caused by mutant measles virus.  subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (sspe) is a progressive neurological disorder of childhood and early adolescence caused by persistent defective measles virus.  subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (sspe) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease caused by the measles (rubeola) virus and is most often seen in children.  this report describes a second sibling set who both contracted subacute sclerosing panencephalitis after concurrent sporadic measles infection.  subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (sspe), is a devastating ""slow virus"" brain disease which affects young children who had measles some 6-7 years earlier.  subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (sspe) is a slowly progressing inflammatory and degenerative disorder of the brain caused by a mutant measles virus.  previous studies have reported that approximately 4-5% of patients with subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (sspe) were given measles vaccination but had no history of natural measles.  subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (sspe) is a slowly progressing fatal human disease of the central nervous system (cns) that is associated with measles virus persistence.  stereotyped periodic 5- to 8-second complexes in the electroencephalogram suggested the diagnosis of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis, subsequently confirmed by intrathecal and serum measles-specific immunoglobulin g synthesis and the presence of rubeola nucleocapsid protein and ribonucleic acid in the biopsied brain. ||| ",no
Is sumoylation implicated in myogenesis?,"sumoylation regulates multiple biological processes, including myoblast proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis.  in conclusion, sumoylation of human spermatozoa may be involved in the regulation of motility.  in vertebrates, developmental roles for sumoylation have been studied, but the function of sumoylation during mammalian oocyte growth and maturation is not known.  in conclusion, hdac1 sumoylation plays a dual role in myod signaling: enhancement of hdac1 deacetylation of myod in the basally sumoylated state of undifferentiated myoblasts and dissociation of hdac1 from myod during myogenesis.  two interesting questions about sumoylation have emerged: (1) how many sumo substrates exist in mammalian proteomes, such as human and mouse, (2) and what are their functions and how are they involved in a variety of biological processes?  as a versatile regulatory mechanism, sumoylation has been found to be essential for ordered diverse cellular processes.  however, the functional roles of the sumo modification during myogenesis have not been fully elucidated.  here, we report that basal sumoylation of histone deacetylase 1 (hdac1) enhances the deacetylation of myod in undifferentiated myoblasts, whereas further sumoylation of hdac1 contributes to switching its binding partners from myod to rb to induce myocyte differentiation.  sumoylation is a post-translational modification involved in the regulation of several cell functions.  sumoylation is a posttranslational modification that regulates a wide spectrum of cellular activities.  protein sumoylation is an important reversible post-translational modification of proteins in the nucleus, and it orchestrates a variety of the cellular processes.  sumoylation, the conjugation of a small ubiquitin-like modifier (sumo) protein to a target, has diverse cellular effects.  the sumo-binding motif exists in nearly all proteins known to be involved in sumo-dependent processes, suggesting its general role in sumoylation-dependent cellular functions.  as a prelude to conducting studies on the role of sumoylation during oocyte development, we analyzed the temporal and spatial pattern of expression of ube2i, a sumo-conjugating e2 enzyme.  we present evidence that in budding yeast sumoylation during mitosis may be controlled through the sumo deconjugating enzyme smt4/ulp2.  sumoylation is a posttranslational modification in which sumo (small ubiquitin-related modifier) proteins are covalently attached to their substrates.  sumo (small ubiquitin-like modifier) modification regulates many cellular processes, including transcription.  we report here that sumo-2/3 conjugation was elevated in the human failing hearts, and we investigated the impact of increased sumo-2 conjugation on heart function by using the gain-of-function approach in mice, in which cardiac specific expression of constitutively active sumo-2 was governed by alpha myosin heavy chain promoter (mhc-sumo-2 transgenic, sumo-2-tg).  recent studies suggest its involvement in spermatogenesis, but occurrence and function of sumo (small ubiquitin-like modifier) in mature spermatozoa remain unknown.  protein sumoylation is a posttranslational modification triggered by cellular stress. ||| ",yes
Is synapsin a phosphoprotein?,"synapsin i is a neuronal phosphoprotein comprised of two closely related polypeptides with apparent molecular weights of 78,000 and 76,000.  synapsin i is a neuron-specific phosphoprotein localized to the cytoplasmic surface of synaptic vesicles.  synapsin i is a neuron specific phosphoprotein that is associated with the cytoplasmic surface of synaptic vesicles.  synapsin i is a neuronal phosphoprotein involved in the localization and stabilization of synaptic vesicles.  synapsin i is a neuron-specific phosphoprotein which is a substrate for camp- and ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases.  synaptophysin (syp) is a major integral membrane protein of secretory vesicles.  the tyrosyl phosphorylated state of synaptophysin is dependent on pp60src kinase and the unknown protein tyrosine phosphate phosphohydrolase (ptpase, ec 3.1.3.48).  here we report the protein tyrosine phosphate phosphohydrolase sh-ptp1, to associate with synaptic vesicles and interact with synaptophysin.  synapsin i is also able to interact with actin filaments in a phosphorylation-dependent manner.  synaptojanin is a polyphosphoinositide phosphatase that is found at synapses and binds to proteins implicated in endocytosis.  we report here the ability of the dephospho-form of synapsin i to bundle f-actin.  the tyrosine kinase pp60src is known to phosphorylate synaptophysin and in doing so may regulate neurotransmitter release.  synaptophysin phosphorylation may be involved in inhibition of acetylcholine release.  synaptojanin1 (synj1) is a phosphoinositide phosphatase with dual sac1 and 5'-phosphatase enzymatic activities in regulating phospholipid signaling.  endogenous phosphorylation of synapsin i (protein i), a phosphoprotein located on the surface of synaptic vesicles, was studied in vesicles prepared from synaptosomes lysed in the absence (control) or presence of 50 microm-cyclic amp (""camp-treated"").  synaptojanin1, the major constitutively active ptdinsp3 5-phosphatase activity in rat brain, is one of two closely related proteins both extensively spliced in their c-terminal proline rich domain.  synaptojanin 1 is a polyphosphoinositide phosphatase concentrated in presynaptic nerve terminals, where it dephosphorylates a pool of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate implicated in synaptic vesicle recycling.  phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of neuronal proteins have been implicated in regulation of synaptic transmission.  it has been suggested that synapsin i is a spectrin binding protein related to the erythrocyte cytoskeletal protein 4.1, which binds to the terminal ends of the erythrocyte spectrin tetramer.  synaptojanin 1 (sj1) is a major presynaptic phosphatase that couples synaptic vesicle endocytosis to the dephosphorylation of pi(4,5)p2, a reaction needed for the shedding of endocytic factors from their membranes. ||| ",yes
Is the ACE inhibitor indicated for lung cancer treatment?,"because of contradictory evidence from clinical trials, the association between angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (aceis) and lung cancer needs further evaluation.  statistical significant lung cancer signals were detected among patients who received acei, especially female patients.  the angiotensin converting enzyme (ace) inhibitors are used widely as antihypertensive agents, and it has been suggested that they decrease the risk of some cancers, although available data are conflicting.  this study is conducted to compare the incidence of lung cancers in patients on aceis and arbs.  results of the carefully executed evaluation of treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and the risk of lung cancer (eracer) study, reported in this issue, echo those of several previous observational analyses of the association of long-term angiotensin-converting enzyme (ace) inhibitor use with incident lung cancer.  in the postmatch group, prescription of ace inhibitor was associated with a significant decrease in the risk of 5-year mortality (hazard ratio 0.61, 95% confidence interval 0.43 to 0.87, p = 0.006).  second, confounding by indication is possible because until 2013, ace inhibitors, not arbs, were first-line medications for heart failure, which is associated with incident lung cancer.  to analyze the association of the use of different doses of angiotensin ii receptor blockers (arb) and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (acei) independently with lung cancer risk and to evaluate the lung cancer type that may be related to arb or acei use.  therefore, our aim was to evaluate the prognostic impact of ace inhibitor in patients with dhf.  we conducted a disproportionality analysis of primary malignant lung cancer adverse events associated with 10 aceis by calculating the reported odds ratios (ror) and information component (ic) with 95% confidence intervals (ci).  in view of these experimental findings, we conclude that captopril could be a promising option for the treatment of lung cancer.  in this study, the incidence of lung cancer was relatively more among people using aceis than arbs.  in adjusted analysis, significantly better survival was observed for patients treated with acei/arb (3-year hazard ratio: 0.80; 95% confidence interval: 0.77 to 0.83).  the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ace) inhibitor has a well defined place in the treatment of systolic heart failure (hf).  on multivariable cox analysis, the relation between ace inhibitor prescription and mortality remained significant (hazard ratio 0.73, 95% confidence interval 0.54 to 0.99, p = 0.045).  ace inhibitor therapy prescribed at discharge in 46% (n = 165) of the 358 included patients was associated with a 30% relative decrease in the risk of 5-year mortality (hazard ratio 0.70, 95% confidence interval 0.53 to 0.93, p = 0.013).  serum angiotensin-converting enzyme (ace) and aldosterone levels of non-small-cell lung cancer patients treated with chemotherapy with or without cediranib were evaluated.  the long-term use of angiotensin converting enzyme (ace) inhibitors may reduce the risk of developing colorectal cancer (crc).  we assessed the long-term prognosis of these patients according to prescription of an ace inhibitor at discharge.  in conclusion, we demonstrate that in this cohort of patients with dhf, prescription of ace inhibitor was associated with a significant decrease in long-term mortality. ||| ",no
Is the Dictyostelium discoideum proteome known?,"dictyostelium discoideum cells are professional phagocytes that provide an easily accessible system to gain insights into the mechanisms and the regulatory machinery controlling phagocytosis.  dictyostelium discoideum is a specialized amoebozoan protist that can feed on, carry and disperse bacteria.  in this report, we identified the proteins secreted by developing dictyostelium cells using ms-based proteomics.  dictyostelium discoideum exhibits the largest repository of polyketide synthase (pks) proteins of all known genomes.  dictyostelium discoideum is a eukaryotic microorganism that is attractive for the study of fundamental biological phenomena such as cell-cell communication, formation of multicellularity, cell differentiation and morphogenesis.  in this study, we provide evidence that dictyostelium discoideum contains pkc delta-like protein that is localized in the nucleus.  the complete genomes of dictyostelium discoideum, dictyostelium purpureum, polysphondylium pallidum and dictyostelium fasciculatum have been sequenced.  dictyostelium discoideum is a unicellular eukaryote that, when starved, aggregates to form multicellular structures.  the discoidin i protein has been studied extensively as a marker of early development in the cellular slime mold dictyostelium discoideum.  dictyostelium discoideum possesses more egf-like (egfl) domains than any other sequenced eukaryote.  the social amoeba dictyostelium discoideum's proteome contains a vast array of simple sequence repeats, providing a unique model to investigate proteostasis.  dictyostelium discoideum is a unicellular eukaryotic model largely used for the study of the endocytic pathway, mainly due to its high resemblance to the mammalian pathway.  a cdna with homology to fatty acid desaturases was selected by searching the cdna data bank of dictyostelium discoideum (http://www.  while dictyostelium discoideum has been studied as a developmental system for decades, and many regulatory proteins have been cloned, the molecular mechanisms of cell-type-specific gene expression are poorly understood.  a total of 349 different secreted proteins were identified, indicating that at least 2.6% of the 13 600 predicted proteins in the dictyostelium genome are secreted.  the unique biology and phylogenetic position of dictyostelium offer a great opportunity to gain knowledge of processes not characterized in other organisms.  the dictyostelium pkc delta-like protein has an apparent molecular mass of 76 kda.  sequence analysis reveals that a gene expressed during growth and early development of dictyostelium discoideum encodes a polypeptide which exhibits extensive similarity with annexins, a family of calcium/phospholipid binding proteins.  other predictions from comparative genomics among the dictyostelids are reviewed and evaluated.  the findings here identify dictyostelium discoideum as a novel microbe to investigate protein quality control pathways during the transition to dormancy. ||| ",yes
Is the Drosophila Translational Control Element (TCE) involved in spermatogenesis?,"translational silencing phenomena during spermatogenesis in the two model systems drosophila and mouse are reviewed.  in drosophila, testis-specific tbp-associated factors (ttafs) predominantly localize to spermatocyte nucleoli and regulate the transcription of genes necessary for spermatocyte entry into meiosis.  spermatogenesis in drosophila melanogaster is characterized by a specific transcriptional program during the spermatocyte stage.  during drosophila spermatogenesis transcriptional activity is mainly restricted to premeiotic stages.  in drosophila spermatogenesis transcription occurs only premeiotically while translation can be detected also in postmeiotic spermatids.  the gene transformer-2 (tra-2) of drosophila is necessary not only for female sexual differentiation but also for normal spermatogenesis in males.  to analyze the regulation of gene expression during male germ cell development, we investigated the testis-specific expression of the drosophila beta 2 tubulin gene.  in drosophila and in mammals, post-meiotic spermatid differentiation depends on several translationally repressed and stored mrnas that are often expressed exclusively in the testis through a cell type specific transcriptional program.  a short summary on the present knowledge on spermatogenesis in drosophila is given which also points out particular questions of interest in the context of this morphogenetic process.  we generated tbrd-1 mutant flies and observed that function of tbrd-1 is required for male fertility.  the genetic analysis of spermatogenesis in drosophila melanogaster has led to the identification of several genes that control the onset of meiosis, spermatid differentiation, or both.  we studied expression of the drosophila beta 2 tubulin gene, which is expressed solely in the male germ line from the primary spermatocyte stage onwards.  the drosophila testis has numerous advantages for the study of basic cellular processes, as production of sperm requires a highly orchestrated and complex combination of morphological changes and developmentally regulated transitions.  one of these proteins in drosophila, orb2, is a principal player in spermatogenesis.  tg-interacting factor (tgif) in drosophila consists of two tandemly-repeated genes, achintya (dmachi) and vismay (dmvis), which act as transcriptional activators in drosophila spermatogenesis.  in vitro mutagenesis and subsequent germline transformation experiments revealed that this sequence is the only element necessary for the testis-specific transcription of the beta 2 tubulin gene in drosophila.  we find that the ribonucleoprotein consensus sequence (rnp-cs) of tra2 is required for male fertility and positive and negative control of alternative splicing in transgenic flies, as well as for in vitro binding of recombinant tra2 to doublesex and tra2 pre-mrnas.  consistent with the role of dmvis in drosophila development, bmtgif significantly affected spermatid differentiation, as indicated by hematoxylin-eosin staining of paraffin sections of testis from bmtgif-small interfering rna (sirna)-injected male silkworms.  in drosophila, the mrnas of proteins required for post-meiotic chromatin reorganisation, like protb and mst77f, are transcribed in meiotic spermatocytes and subjected to translational repression for days.  the process of spermatogenesis in drosophila melanogaster provides a powerful model system to probe a variety of developmental and cell biological questions, such as the characterization of mechanisms that regulate stem cell behavior, cytokinesis, meiosis, and mitochondrial dynamics. ||| ",yes
Is the HRC Ser96Ala variant associated with sudden cardiac death in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy?,"the histidine-rich calcium-binding protein (hrc) ser96ala variant has previously been identified as a potential biomarker for ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death in patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy.  the histidine-rich calcium binding protein (hrc) ser96ala polymorphism was shown to correlate with ventricular arrhythmias and sudden death only in dilated cardiomyopathy patients but not in healthy human carriers.  a human genetic variant (ser96ala) in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (sr) histidine-rich ca(2+)-binding (hrc) protein has been linked to ventricular arrhythmia and sudden death in dilated cardiomyopathy.  these findings indicate that the hrc ser96ala variant increases the propensity of arrhythmogenic ca(2+) waves in the stressed failing heart, suggesting a link between this genetic variant and life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias in human carriers.  the ser96ala (s96a) mutation within the histidine rich ca(2+) binding protein (hrc) has recently been linked to cardiac arrhythmias in idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy patients, potentially attributable to an increase in spontaneous ca(2+) release events.  the homologous mutation ser81ala in hrc in mice, corresponding to ser96ala in humans, is associated with sudden death and depressed cardiac function.  this mutation is associated with sudden death at any age and dilated cardiomyopathy-like features in those aged >40 years.  the hrc-ser81ala mice presented increased mortality in the absence of structural or histological abnormalities, indicating that early death may be arrhythmia-related.  we investigated inducibility of life-threatening arrhythmias with programmed ventricular stimulation (pvs) in relation to clinical markers of sudden cardiac death (scd) in subjects with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (hcm) attributable to the asp175asn mutation in the alpha-tropomyosin gene (tpm1-asp175asn).  sudden cardiac death due to malignant arrhythmias is a common cause of death in dilated cardiomyopathy (dcm).  however, expression of the hrc(s96a) genetic variant in cardiomyocytes from a rat model of postmyocardial infarction heart failure induced dramatic disturbances of rhythmic ca(2+) transients.  dilated cardiomyopathy (dcm) is a primary disease of the heart muscle associated with sudden cardiac death secondary to ventricular tachyarrhythmias and asystole.  collectively, our results demonstrate that the human hrc mutation s96a leads to an increase in spontaneous ca(2+) release and ultimately arrhythmias by disrupting the regulation of intra-store free ca(2+).  ala96 hrc decreased (25% to 30%) cardiomyocyte contractility and ca2+ kinetics compared with ser96 hrc in the absence of any structural or histological abnormalities.  high resting heart rate (hr) has been associated with sudden cardiac death (scd).  a portion of sudden cardiac deaths can be attributed to structural heart diseases, such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (hcm) or cardiac channelopathies such as long-qt syndrome (lqts); however, the underlying molecular mechanisms are distinct.  this study examines the relation of qt dispersion (qtd) on a surface electrocardiogram (ecg) to clinical features and established risk factors of sudden cardiac death (scd) in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (hc).  adverse left ventricular (lv) remodeling predicts heart failure symptoms and overt lv dysfunction in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (hcm), but its influence on the occurrence of sudden cardiac death (scd) is unknown.  hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (hcm) and dilated cardiomyopathy (dcm) are the most common hereditary cardiac conditions.  inducibility was associated with the maximum left ventricular (lv) thickness and the number of markers of scd, suggesting that in hcm patients with an identical causative mutation, susceptibility to ventricular arrhythmias is related to the cardiomyopathic phenotype. ||| ",yes
Is the Histidine-Rich Calcium Binding protein (HRC) related to arrhythmias and cardiac disease?,"the histidine-rich calcium binding protein (hrc) ser96ala polymorphism was shown to correlate with ventricular arrhythmias and sudden death only in dilated cardiomyopathy patients but not in healthy human carriers.  the histidine-rich calcium-binding protein (hrc) ser96ala variant has previously been identified as a potential biomarker for ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death in patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy.  the ser96ala (s96a) mutation within the histidine rich ca(2+) binding protein (hrc) has recently been linked to cardiac arrhythmias in idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy patients, potentially attributable to an increase in spontaneous ca(2+) release events.  we hypothesized that the histidine-rich ca binding protein (hrc) in the sr may be involved in sr ca cycling and that alterations in hrc levels would result in abnormal cardiac ca homeostasis.  a human genetic variant (ser96ala) in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (sr) histidine-rich ca(2+)-binding (hrc) protein has been linked to ventricular arrhythmia and sudden death in dilated cardiomyopathy.  hrc (histidine-rich ca2+ binding protein) has been identified from skeletal and cardiac muscle and shown to bind ca2+ with low affinity and high capacity that is reminiscent of calsequestrin.  the histidine-rich calcium binding protein (hrc) is a regulator of ca2+-homeostasis.  the hrc gene encodes the histidine-rich calcium-binding protein, which is found in the lumen of the junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum (sr) of cardiac and skeletal muscle and within calciosomes of arterial smooth muscle.  the histidine-rich calcium-binding protein (hrc) is a regulator of ca2+ homeostasis and it plays a significant role in hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc) progression.  the histidine-rich calcium binding protein (hrc) is a novel regulator of sarcoplasmic reticulum (sr) ca(2+)-uptake, storage and release.  the histidine-rich ca(2+) binding protein (hrc) is a high capacity ca(2+) binding protein in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (sr).  these findings indicate that the hrc ser96ala variant increases the propensity of arrhythmogenic ca(2+) waves in the stressed failing heart, suggesting a link between this genetic variant and life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias in human carriers.  collectively, our results demonstrate that the human hrc mutation s96a leads to an increase in spontaneous ca(2+) release and ultimately arrhythmias by disrupting the regulation of intra-store free ca(2+).  this review summarizes studies, which have established the critical role of hrc in ca(2+)-homeostasis, suggesting its importance in cardiac physiology and pathophysiology.  collectively, these data suggest that hrc may be an integral regulatory protein involved in cardiac muscle sr ca uptake and ca homeostasis.  chronic overexpression of hrc that may disrupt intracellular ca(2+) homeostasis is implicated in pathogenesis of cardiac hypertrophy.  histidine-rich calcium binding protein (hrc) is located in the lumen of sarcoplasmic reticulum (sr) that binds to both triadin (trn) and serca affecting ca(2+) cycling in the sr.  increased cardiac hrc levels were associated with impaired sr ca uptake rates (35%) and attenuated cardiomyocyte ca transient decay (38%), without alterations in peak ca transients or sr ca load.  interestingly, hrc has been linked with familiar cardiac conduction disease and an hrc polymorphism was shown to associate with malignant ventricular arrhythmias in the background of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy.  the histidine-rich ca(2+)-binding protein (hrc) is located in the lumen of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (sr) and exhibits high-capacity ca(2+)-binding properties. ||| ",yes
Is the JNK pathway activated during liver regeneration?,"strong activation of jnk was reported in the regenerating liver, implicating jnk in growth stimulation of hepatocytes.  in the present study, we aimed to characterize and define the cell-type-specific contribution of jnk1 activation during liver regeneration.  in summary, we provide evidence that (1) jnk1 in hematopoietic cells is crucial for liver regeneration, and (2) a synergistic function between jnk1 in hepatocytes and hematopoietic-derived cells is involved in the hepatic regenerative response.  in conclusion, our data show that jnk drives g0 to g1 transition in hepatocytes and that cyclin d1 is a downstream target of the jnk pathway during liver regeneration.  liver regeneration is controlled by a complex network of signaling molecules, and a prominent role for c-jun n-terminal kinase has been suggested during this process.  our results show that liver regeneration was significantly impaired in jnk1(-/-) compared to jnk1(δhepa) and wt animals.  the c-jun-n-terminal kinase (jnk) pathway is strongly activated after partial hepatectomy (ph), but its role in hepatocyte proliferation is not known.  a role for jnk in liver parenchymal cells has been proposed, but more recent studies have implicated non-parenchymal liver cells as the relevant site of jnk signaling.  c-jun n-terminal kinase (jnk) is activated by multiple profibrogenic mediators; jnk activation occurs during toxic, metabolic, and autoimmune liver injury.  the transplantation of bone marrow-derived jnk1(-/-) into wt recipients caused significant reduction in liver regeneration.  interestingly, the transplantation of jnk1(-/-) into mice lacking jnk1 in hepatocytes only partially delayed liver regeneration.  c-jun n-terminal kinase (jnk) is a key regulator in tumor necrosis factor (tnf)-mediated liver injury.  c-jun n-terminal kinase (jnk) 1 and jnk2 are expressed in hepatocytes and have overlapping and distinct functions.  we performed gene expression microarray and phosphoproteomic analyses to determine mechanisms of jnk activity in hepatocytes.  additionally, bone marrow transplantation experiments were conducted in order to identify the contribution of hematopoietic cell-derived jnk1 activation for liver regeneration.  jnk may play a critical role in hepatocytes during tnf-stimulated cell death in vivo.  inhibition of jnk may be a new therapeutic strategy to prevent liver injury after transplantation.  in this study, we examined the effects of modulation of the jnk pathway in liver on insulin resistance and glucose tolerance.  c-jun n-terminal kinase (jnk) activation is pivotal in the development of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (nash).  the cjun nh2-terminal kinase (jnk) signaling pathway is required for the development of hepatitis and hepatocellular carcinoma. ||| ",yes
Is the Miller-Fisher syndrome considered to be a variant of Guillain-Barré?,"miller fisher syndrome is an uncommon disease and it is a variant of guillain-barre syndrome.  miller fisher syndrome is an acute inflammatory polyradiculoneuropathy that is generally considered a variant of guillain-barré syndrome and is characterized by the clinical triad of ataxia, areflexia, and ophthalmoplegia.  miller-fisher syndrome (mfs) is considered as a variant of the guillain-barre syndrome (gbs) and its characteristic clinical features are ophthalmoplegia, ataxia, and areflexia.  miller fisher syndrome (mfs) is considered to be an uncommon variant of guillain-barré syndrome.  miller fisher syndrome is a variant of guillain-barré syndrome, characterized by ophthalmoplegia, ataxia and areflexia.  background miller fisher syndrome is characterized by the clinical triad of ophthalmoplegia, ataxia, and areflexia, and is considered to be a variant of guillain-barre syndrome.  miller fisher syndrome (mfs), characterized as ataxia, areflexia and ophthalmoplegia, is generally considered as a variant of guillain-barré syndrome (gbs).  miller fisher syndrome (mfs) is a rare variant of guillain-barré syndrome (gbs) that has a geographically variable incidence.  miller fisher's syndrome is a rare variant of guillain-barré's syndrome characterized by the acute development of ataxia, ophthalmoparesis, and areflexia.  miller-fisher syndrome (mfs) is considered a variant of guillain-barrd syndrome (gbs).  miller fisher syndrome represents a variant with predominant facial and cranial nerve involvement, although miller fisher and guillain-barré overlap syndromes can occur.  miller fisher syndrome (mfs) is a localized variant of guillain-barré syndrome (gbs), characterized by ophthalmoplegia, areflexia, and ataxia.  the syndrome of ataxia, areflexia and ophthalmoplegia, or miller-fisher syndrome, has been considered to be a variant of guillain-barré syndrome with pathology restricted to the peripheral nervous system.  miller fisher syndrome is observed in approximately 1-5% of all guillain-barre cases in western countries.  here we are reporting a case of miller fisher variant with guillain-barre syndrome overlap in which ataxia, are flexia, oculomotor disturbance and limb weakness occurred within few days.  venous thromboembolism is a common complication of guillain-barre syndrome and has also been reported in miller fisher syndrome, but it has generally been reported in the presence of at least one prothrombotic risk factor such as immobility.  controversy exists concerning whether miller fisher syndrome (mfs) is the result of a predominantly axonal or demyelinating polyneuropathy and whether the guillain-barré syndrome variant of acute ataxia and areflexia without ophthalmoplegia, ataxic guillain-barré syndrome (atxgbs), has a distinct pathophysiology.  miller fisher syndrome also has rarer variants.  electromyography and a nerve conduction study demonstrated a severe sensorimotor axonal polyneuropathy consistent with miller fisher variant guillain-barré syndrome.  several variants of guillain-barré syndrome have been described. ||| ",yes
Is the PTPN22 gene a biomarker for Rheumatoid Arthritis?,"the ptpn22 rs2476601 genetic variant has been associated with rheumatoid arthritis (ra) and other autoimmune diseases.  ptpn22 (protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type 22) 1858c>t single-nucleotide polymorphism (snp) is one of the genetic risk factors of rheumatoid arthritis (ra).  the r620w variant in protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor 22 (ptpn22) is associated with rheumatoid arthritis (ra).  several protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor 22 (ptpn22) single-nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) have been significantly related with rheumatoid arthritis (ra) susceptibility.  the presence of the ptpn22 risk allele (1858t) is associated with several autoimmune diseases including rheumatoid arthritis (ra).  the tyrosine phosphatase ptpn22 allele 1858t has been associated with rheumatoid arthritis (ra) and other autoimmune diseases.  the ptpn22 rs2476601 polymorphism is associated with rheumatoid arthritis (ra); nonetheless, the association is weaker or absent in some southern european populations.  the ptpn22 gene is an important risk factor for human autoimmunity.  a single nucleotide polymorphism (snp) of the protein tyrosine phosphatase nonreceptor gene (ptpn22) confers susceptibility to rheumatoid arthritis (ra) and certain other classical autoimmune diseases.  to assess whether there are cis-regulatory polymorphisms that regulate protein tyrosine phosphatase, non-receptor type 22 (ptpn22) expression in rheumatoid arthritis (ra).  the gene encoding protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type 22 (ptpn22) has been reported to be associated with ra in several populations.  to assess the possible association between the ptpn22 gene 1858c-->t polymorphism and the predisposition and clinical expression of 2 systemic autoimmune diseases, rheumatoid arthritis (ra) and systemic lupus erythematosus (sle).  the aim of this study was to determine whether the protein tyrosine phosphatase nonreceptor 22 (ptpn22) c1858t polymorphism confers susceptibility to rheumatoid arthritis (ra) in populations with different ethnicities.  the 1858 c/t (rs2476601) single nucleotide polymorphism (snp) within the ptpn22 gene has been associated with susceptibility to inflammatory based diseases in several populations.  a functional single nucleotide polymorphism (snp) of ptpn22 gene encoding the protein tyrosine phosphatase has been reported to be associated with autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus and type i diabetes.  ptpn22 accounting for approximately 1% of the ra familial aggregation, many new genes could be expected that are as many leads to definitive therapy for autoimmune diseases.  with diabetes and ra, ptpn22 is therefore a ""linkage-proven"" autoimmunity gene.  our study indicated that ptpn22 1858t allele was significantly associated with increased ra risk.  the association between ptpn22 and csk expression in ra patients and their clinical characteristics was also evaluated.  polymorphisms in the ptpn22 locus (25 snps) and phenotypic data (gender, disease activity, acpa and rf status) were used for analysis. ||| ",yes

Is the Prostate- Specific Antigen (PSA) test relevant only for prostate cancer?,"prostate specific antigen (psa) is currently used as a biomarker to diagnose prostate cancer.  prostate-specific antigen (psa) is a widely used marker for prostate cancer.  prostate specific antigen (psa) is the most widely known screening test to detect prostate cancer (pca).  prostate-specific antigen (psa) is the most commonly used tumour marker for prostate cancer, both in screening and in follow-up.  prostate-specific antigen (psa) is recognized as an organ-specific marker with low specificity and sensitivity in discriminating prostate cancer (pca) from other benign conditions, such as prostatic hyperplasia or chronic prostatitis.  prostate specific antigen (psa) is the most useful marker for prostate carcinoma (cap).  prostate cancer (pca) is mostly detected by prostate-specific antigen (psa) as one of the most widely used tumor markers.  psa testing has been widely used to detect and screen prostate cancer.  currently, prostate- specific antigen (psa) is the most common oncological marker used for prostate cancer screening.  prostate-specific antigen (psa) is a widely used serum marker for prostate cancer (pca) but has limited specificity for distinguishing early pca from benign prostatic hyperplasia, because both pca and benign prostatic hyperplasia release psa into the serum.  psa is specific for the prostate, but not for prostate cancer.  psa is currently used as a marker of prostate carcinoma because high levels of psa are indicative of a tumor situation.  the primary method of screening for and detecting prostate cancer is the prostate-specific antigen (psa) test.  prostate-specific antigen is currently the only protein biomarker routinely used as a diagnostic tool for early detection and treatment monitoring of prostate cancer.  prostate specific antigen (psa), neutral serine protease secreted exclusively by prostatic epithelial cells, has a number of applications in the management of men with prostatic carcinoma.  currently, most men are diagnosed with prostate cancer (pca) after a prostate-specific antigen (psa) test shows an elevated level of the psa protein.  herein, we reviewed the information on psa and other novel tests that can assist in diagnosing clinically meaningful prostate cancer.  although this test is very prostate-specific, it is not cancer-specific; conditions other than prostate cancer can cause an elevated psa.  determination of psa levels is not 100% sensitive for prostate cancer, as psa levels may be normal despite presence of prostate cancer.  despite the considerable attention given to the prostate-specific antigen (psa) as a screening test for prostate cancer, it is needle biopsy--and not the psa test result--that actually establishes the diagnosis of prostate cancer. ||| ",no
Is the SDHAF2 gene  encoding a protein necessary for flavination of SDHA?,"to date, only an assembly factor (sdhaf2) required for fad insertion into subunit sdh1 has been identified in plants.  we conclude that sdhaf4 acts on fad-sdh1 and promotes its assembly with sdh2, thereby stabilizing sdh2 and enabling its full assembly with sdh3/sdh4 to form the sdh complex.  the increased levels of sdhaf2 suggest that the stabilization of soluble fad-sdh1 depends on sdhaf2 availability.  sdh assembly appears to require fad binding but not necessarily covalent fad attachment.  recent studies have indicated that post-translational flavinylation of succinate dehydrogenase subunit a (sdha) in eukaryotes and bacteria require the chaperone-like proteins sdh5 and sdhe, respectively.  with each mutant sdh1, second-site sdh1 suppressor mutations were recovered in sdh1 permitting flavinylation, stabilization of sdh5 and sdh tetramer assembly.  these results document the basis for the sdh deficiency and pathology seen with mutations in human sdh1.  we demonstrate that the fad assembly factor sdhe, which flavinylates and activates the respiratory enzyme succinate dehydrogenase (sdh), is also required for the complete activation and flavinylation of frd.  mass spectrometry analyses revealed stable levels of fad-sdh1 in sdhaf4, together with increased levels of the fad-sdh1 assembly factor, sdhaf2, and reduced levels of sdh2 compared with the wild type.  the impaired assembly of sdh with the c-terminal sdh1 mutants suggests that fad binding is important to stabilize the sdh1 conformation enabling association with sdh2 and the membrane anchor subunits.  loss of sdhaf4 in sdhaf4 inhibited the formation of the sdh1/sdh2 intermediate, leading to the accumulation of soluble sdh1 in the mitochondrial matrix and reduced levels of sdh1 in the membrane.  mutational analyses of sdh1 implicate c-terminal region arg residues involvement in covalent flavinylation and sdh assembly.  sdhe interacted with, and flavinylated, the flavoprotein subunit frda, whilst mutations in a conserved rgxxe motif impaired the complete flavinylation and activation of frd.  how does covalent flavinylation occur in prokaryotes, which lack sdhe homologs?  sdh assembly is dependent on fad binding to sdh1 but not covalent binding.  the fp subunit of succinate dehydrogenase was found to be the only (major) flavinylated protein in the cell.  the sdh complex consists of four core subunits and multiple cofactors, which must be assembled correctly to ensure enzyme function.  the enzymatic function of succinate dehydrogenase (sdh) is dependent on covalent attachment of fad on the ~70-kda flavoprotein subunit sdh1.  succinate dehydrogenase (sdh) requires a covalent addition of fad for catalytic function.  mutation of arg(638) compromises sdh function only when present in combination with a cys(630) substitution. ||| ",yes

Is the Snord116 cluster associated with the Prader-Willi syndrome?,"lack of expression for snord116 has been implicated in major phenotypes of prader-willi syndrome (pws).  the snord116 locus lies in the 15q11-13 region of paternally expressed genes implicated in prader-willi syndrome (pws), a complex disease accompanied by obesity and severe neurobehavioural disturbances.  the loss of two gene clusters encoding small nucleolar rnas, snord115 and snord116 contribute to prader-willi syndrome (pws), the most common syndromic form of obesity in humans.  prader-willi syndrome (pws), an imprinted neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by metabolic, sleep and neuropsychiatric features, is caused by the loss of paternal snord116, containing only non-coding rnas (ncrnas).  the imprinted small nucleolar rna (snorna) snord116 is implicated in the aetiology of prader-willi syndrome (pws), a disease associated with hyperphagia and obesity.  obsessive-compulsive disorder has been reported in association with prader-willi syndrome.  sleep-wake disturbances are often reported in prader-willi syndrome (pws), a rare neurodevelopmental syndrome that is associated with paternally-expressed genomic imprinting defects within the human chromosome region 15q11-13.  sleep apnoea and minor radiological evidence of narrowing of the upper airway are common in the prader-willi syndrome, although clinical otolaryngological examination is often unremarkable.  attempted complete ascertainment of people with prader-willi syndrome in eight english counties.  cases of pws patients with a deletion encompassing the snord116 gene cluster, but preserving the expression of flanking genes, have been described.  prader-willi syndrome is most often associated with interstitial deletion or uniparental disomy of chromosome 15q11-q13.  this finding in a human case strongly supports the current hypothesis that lack of the paternal snord116 gene cluster has a determinant role in the pathogenesis of pws.  individuals with prader-willi syndrome have speech and language impairments, suggesting possible involvement of the perisylvian region of the brain.  cooccurrence of prader-willi syndrome and psychosis has been reported in a few cases.  to investigate the role of anatomical factors in osa in the prader-willi syndrome, clinical and ent assessment, radiology of the upper airway and polysomnography including sleep oximetry were done in 14 subjects.  in prader-willi syndrome (pws), nonprotein coding small nucleolar (sno) rnas are involved in the paternally deleted region of chromosome 15q11.2-q13, which is believed to cause the hyperphagic phenotype of pws.  prader-willi syndrome (pws), a rare genetic disorder caused by the lack of expression of paternal genes from chromosome 15q11-13, has been investigated for autism spectrum disorder (asd) symptomatology in various studies.  prader willi syndrome (pws) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by a range of physical, psychological and physiological abnormalities.  recently, the snord116 gene has been associated with the development of pws, however, it's contribution to the behavioural aspects of the disease are unknown.  furthermore, an additional case with prader-willi syndrome and psychosis is briefly described. ||| ",yes
Is the UGT1A1*28 polymorphism associated with irinotecan response in Caucasians?,"previous studies of irinotecan pharmacogenetics have shown that the ugt1a1*28 polymorphism has an effect on irinotecan (iri)-induced toxicities in caucasians.  the ugt1a1*28 polymorphism is known as a biomarker of irinotecan-induced neutropenia in caucasians.  our data showed that the ugt1a1*28 polymorphism had a significant relationship with toxicity and response to irinotecan-based chemotherapy.  the ugt1a1*28 polymorphism was suggested to be significantly connected with irinotecan-induced toxicity and response to chemotherapy.  our purpose was to study the association between ugt1a1*28, ugt1a7*2, and ugt1a7*3 polymorphisms and irinotecan toxicity in greek patients receiving low-dose weekly irinotecan.  the purpose of this study was to determine the associations between ugt1a1(*)28 and (*)6 polymorphisms and irinotecan toxicity in thai patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.  ugt1a1 polymorphisms in the coding region of the ugt1a1 gene should be genotyped in addition to testing for ugt1a1*28 to more accurately predict irinotecan-related toxicity, at least in asian patients.  ugt1a1 gene polymorphism predicts irinotecan-related adverse reactions in advanced crc patients of xinjiang uygur and han nationality; ugt1a1 gene polymorphism is correlated with efficacy and prognosis in uygur nationality, but only related to prognosis in han nationality in irinotecan-based chemotherapy.  ugt1a1*28 is considered the main pharmacogenetic predictor of the toxicity outcome of irinotecan-treated patients.  it is known that the uridine-diphosphoglucuronosyl transferase 1a1 (ugt1a1)*28 polymorphism reduces ugt1a1 enzyme activity, which may lead to severe toxicities in patients who receive irinotecan.  the current data suggested that the ugt1a1*28 polymorphism may be a key determinant for predicting irinotecan-induced severe toxicities without affecting treatment outcome for patients with metastatic crc.  both ugt1a1(*)28 and (*)6 polymorphisms may have an increased risk of irinotecan-induced neutropenia in thai colorectal cancer patients.  concurrence of ugt1a1*28 and ugt1a1*6, even when heterozygous, altered the disposition of irinotecan remarkably, potentially increasing susceptibility to toxicity.  uridine 5'-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase (ugt), a metabolic enzyme of irinotecan active metabolite, has two genetic polymorphisms (ugt1a1*6 and ugt1a1*28).  irinotecan-induced severe toxicities are possibly related to ugt1a1*6 and *28 genotypes.  ugt1a1 is a polymorphic enzyme that has been associated with irinotecan drug metabolisms.  the relationship between ugt1a1*6/*28 and abcb1-3435c>t polymorphisms and irinotecan induced severe diarrhea and neutropenia were analyzed.  udp-glucuronosyltransferase1a1 (ugt1a1) polymorphisms have been related with irinotecan toxicity.  various polymorphisms have been detected in the udp-glucuronosyltransferase 1a ( ugt1a ) gene, and ugt1a1 *28 and ugt1a1 *6 have important effects on the pharmacokinetics of irinotecan and the risk of severe toxicities during irinotecan therapy.  uridine glucuronosyltransferase (ugt) gene polymorphisms have been linked to irinotecan toxicity. ||| ",yes
Is the Wnt protein modified by notum?,"notum is a secreted member of the α/β-hydrolase superfamily that hydrolyzes the palmitoleoylate modification on wnt proteins, thereby disrupting wnt signaling.  notum has recently been identified as a negative regulator of wnt signaling through the removal of an essential palmitoleate group from wnt proteins.  notum is a secreted wnt antagonist that belongs to the α/β hydrolase superfamily, but its mechanism of action and roles in vertebrate embryogenesis are not fully understood.  as a secreted inhibitor of wnt, notum presents an attractive molecular target for improving skeletal health.  notum was recently shown to act as a negative regulator of wnt signaling through the removal of an essential palmitoleate group.  indeed, the wnt-deacylase activity of notum is the basis of its ability to act as a feedback inhibitor of wnt signalling.  notum suppressed wnt signaling in cell reporter assays, but surprisingly also enhanced shh signaling independent of effects on wnt.  here, we report that notum hydrolyzes the wnt palmitoleoylate adduct extracellularly, resulting in inactivated wnt proteins that form oxidized oligomers incapable of receptor binding.  thus, notum is a wnt deacylase, and palmitoleoylation is obligatory for the wnt structure that maintains its active monomeric conformation.  secreted wnt proteins play essential roles in many biological processes during development and diseases.  we are investigating the role of notum in modulating wnt signalling in the central nervous system and wished to establish if 1 would serve as a peripherally restricted control.  wnt genes indeed encode secreted molecules, but soluble active wnt protein has not been found.  we present evidence that notum influences wingless protein distribution by modifying the heparan sulfate proteoglycans dally-like and dally.  unexpectedly, a non-wnt ligand for this receptor complex has now been discovered.  wntless also known as wls, gpr177, or evi, is a key modulator of wnt protein secretion.  while it has been suggested that wnt proteins may target cytoskeletal structures more directly, no definitive studies have identified an intracellular association and function for these molecules.  the phenotypes caused by mutations in wnt genes suggest that their gene products are involved in cell-to-cell communication.  notum inhibitors can restore wnt signaling which may be of therapeutic benefit for pathologies such as osteoporosis and alzheimer's disease.  recently, wntless (wls/evi/srt) was identified as a conserved multi-pass transmembrane protein whose function seems to be dedicated to promoting the release of wnts.  wnt5a is a representative wnt ligand that regulates multiple cellular functions through the wnt5a non-classical pathway. ||| ",yes
Is the abnormal dosage of ultraconserved elements disfavored in cancer cells?,"oxidative damage to dna appears to be a factor in cancer, yet explanations for why highly elevated levels of such lesions do not always result in cancer remain elusive.  during the early stages of the multistep process of tumorigenesis, incipient cancer cells probably have adopted genetic and epigenetic alterations to tolerate the lethal mutations of other genes that ensue, and to a larger extent cin.  given the potential of cells with abnormal karyotypes to become cancerous, do pathways that limit the prevalence of such cells exist?  but are these changes merely a small piece of the oncogenesis puzzle or could they be the major component, or even sufficient for cancer?  cancer-specific, epigenetically-based changes in gene expression caused by abnormalities in dna methylation, in histone modifications, and in nucleosome positioning are gaining recognition as driving events in tumorigenesis.  additionally, the presence of short dysfunctional telomeres in cells can also cause these cells to become sensitive to mutagens, and particularly to radiation exposure.  we propose that cells with abnormal karyotypes generate a signal for their own elimination that may serve as a means for cancer cell immunosurveillance.  mutations that cause chromosome instability (cin) in cancer cells produce ""sublethal"" deficiencies in an essential process (chromosome segregation) and, therefore, may represent a major untapped resource that could be exploited for therapeutic benefit in the treatment of cancer.  telomere function may well be involved in cellular and organism responses to ionizing radiation.  unrestrained tumor growth can be associated with incidental errors in the genome during replication and genotoxic agents can alter the structure and sequence of our dna.  genomic instability is often considered a hallmark of cancer.  despite its ubiquity in cancer, link with other pathologies, and role in promoting adaptive evolution, the effects of aneuploidy or imbalanced chromosomal content on cellular physiology have remained incompletely characterized.  accordingly, interfering with tumor lethality suppression could lead to cancer cell death or growth defects.  fluctuating hypoxia, as an important and neglected factor, has been confirmed to induce malignant progression, confer to therapeutic resistance and exist extensively.  we wonder if most cancer stem cells (cscs) survive and are maintained in the region of fluctuating hypoxia, which protects them against differentiation.  finally, we propose a novel hypothesis to explain the hitherto enigmatic abundance compensation of proteins encoded on supernumerary chromosomes.  paradoxically, cancer cells, especially in solid tumors, contain somatic gene mutations and are chromosome instability (cin), suggesting a mechanism that cancer cells have acquired to suppress the lethal mutations and/or cin.  aneuploidy, a state of karyotype imbalance, is a hallmark of cancer.  in turn, cin mediated massive gain and loss of genes provides a wider buffer for further genetic reshuffling, resulting in cancer cell heterogeneity, drug resistance and evasion of oncogene addiction, thus cin may be both the effector and inducer of tumorigenesis.  cer1 - our main focus - contains multiple genes that may inhibit tumor growth, but 3 genes, ris1, lf (ltf) and limd1 have already the necessary experimental support to be considered bona fide tumor suppressors. ||| ",no
Is the circadian clock involved in ribosome biogenesis?,"while the influence of the circadian clock has recently been shown to extend to ribosome biogenesis, the dynamics and regulation of the many small nucleolar rna that are required in pre-ribosomal rna folding and modification are unknown.  more broadly, these results expand the role of the circadian clock to the regulation of protein synthesis.  we have investigated the role of the circadian clock in the regulation of expression of genes required for ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (rubisco) synthesis, assembly, and activation.  little work has been done on circadian regulation of translation, so to address this deficit we conducted ribosome profiling experiments in a human cell model for an autonomous clock.  unexpectedly, we found that the clock also regulates the formation of cytoplasmic processing (p) bodies, which control the fate of mrnas, suggesting circadian coordination of mrna metabolism and translation.  the circadian clock in eukaryotes controls transcriptional and posttranscriptional events, including regulation of the levels and phosphorylation state of translation factors.  here, we show that the key circadian transcription factor bmal1 associates with the translational machinery in the cytosol and promotes protein synthesis.  in most organisms, circadian rhythms are generated by a molecular clockwork involving so-called clock genes.  the outcome is that ribonucleic acids (rnas) and proteins produced from many of these genes oscillate with a circadian rhythm.  the core oscillator generating circadian rhythms in eukaryotes is composed of transcription--translation-based autoregulatory feedback loops in which clock gene products negatively affect their own expression.  the circadian timing system synchronizes cellular function by coordinating rhythmic transcription via a transcription-translational feedback loop.  nevertheless, we found that translation occurs in a circadian fashion for many genes, sometimes imposing an additional level of control on rhythmically expressed mrnas and, in other cases, conferring rhythms on noncycling mrnas.  the circadian rhythm is originally generated by a transcription-translation based oscillatory loop composed of a set of clock genes in most organisms.  protein synthesis rates demonstrate circadian oscillations dependent on bmal1.  circadian rhythms allow organisms to time biological processes to the most appropriate phases of the day-night cycle.  using a novel computational method, we show that 18s and 28s pre-rrna are subject to circadian regulation in a nuclear rna sequencing time course.  protein synthesis is critical for circadian clock function, but little is known of how translational regulation controls the master pacemaker in mammals, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (scn).  we discovered, transcriptome-wide, extensive rhythms in ribosome occupancy and identified a core set of approximately 150 mrnas subject to particularly robust daily changes in translation efficiency.  post-transcriptional regulation is emerging as an important component of circadian networks, but the molecular mechanisms linking the circadian clock to the control of rna processing are largely unknown.  we found that most rhythmic gene expression occurs with little delay between transcription and translation, suggesting that the lag in the accumulation of some clock proteins relative to their mrnas does not arise from regulated translation. ||| ",yes
Is the consumption of chocolate associated with an increase in cardiovascular disease?,"supported by epidemiological evidence, chocolate has emerged as a possible modulator of cardiovascular risk.  thus, we sought to examine whether chocolate consumption is associated with calcified atherosclerotic plaque in the coronary arteries (cac).  we sought to examine the association between chocolate consumption and prevalent chd.  accumulating evidence suggests potential preventive effects of chocolate/cocoa on the risk of cardio vascular disease (cvd).  the high saturated fat content of chocolate has also contributed to the belief that its consumption increases the risk of heart disease.  therefore, we aimed to synthesize and evaluate the credibility of evidence on the dose-response association between chocolate consumption with risk of all-cause mortality, coronary heart disease (chd), stroke, heart failure (hf), type 2 diabetes (t2d), colorectal cancer (crc), and hypertension.  herein, we conducted a meta-analysis of prospective studies to determine the association between chocolate intake and risk of coronary heart disease (chd), stroke, and diabetes.  these data suggest that consumption of chocolate is inversely related with prevalent chd in a general united states population.  consumption of chocolate has been often hypothesized to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease (cvd) due to chocolate's high levels of stearic acid and antioxidant flavonoids.  there is a substantial interest in the potential role of chocolate in the prevention of cardiovascular diseases.  in conclusion, chocolate intake is associated with decreased risks of chd, stroke, and diabetes.  previous studies have shown favorable effects of chocolate products on the cardiovascular system and reported an inverse relationship between chocolate consumption and adverse cardiac events; however, relationships between chocolate eating habits and heart rate variability have not yet been studied.  the consumption of chocolate and cocoa has established cardiovascular benefits.  chocolate consumption is not related to risk for several chronic diseases, but could have a small inverse association with chd and stroke.  however, limited data are available on the association of chocolate consumption and the risk of coronary heart disease (chd).  chocolate consumption has been shown to protect against various cardiovascular end points; however, little is known about the association between chocolate consumption and incident atrial fibrillation (af).  our results demonstrate that a higher chocolate consumption was associated with lower total and central fatness in european adolescents.  chocolate has thus been shown to have potential beneficial effects with respect to heart disease.  however, recent human studies have proven that chocolate has beneficial effects on some pathogenic mechanisms of heart disease such as endothelial function and blood pressure.  consumption of non-chocolate candy was associated with a 49% higher prevalence of chd comparing 5+/week vs. 0/week . ||| ",no
Is the enzyme EPRS phosphorylated?,"protein phosphorylation is a common regulator of enzyme activity.  when the enzyme is phosphorylated it is inactivated and can be reactivated by removal of phosphate.  therefore, pka phosphorylation is suggested to play a regulatory role in ep24.15 enzyme activity.  upon binding, the n-terminal domains of ptp-sl and step were phosphorylated by erk1/2, whereas these ptps dephosphorylated the regulatory phosphotyrosine residues of erk1/2 and inactivated them.  here, we extend our previous observations showing that peptide phosphorylation changes the kinetic parameters of structurally related endopeptidase ep24.15 (ec 3.4.24.15), neurolysin (ec 3.4.24.16), and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ec 3.4.15.1).  this study identifies a specific amino acid phosphorylated in endogenous egr-1.  sucrose-phosphate synthase (sps; ec 2.4.1.14) is regulated by reversible protein phosphorylation.  here we phosphorylated recombinant egr-1 in vitro with erk1 prior to mass spectrometry, which identified phosphorylation of ser12 and ser26 with the latter ∼12 times more abundant than ser12.  phosphorylation is a reversible post-translational modification regulated by phosphorylase and dephosphorylase to mediate important cellular events.  we report the physical and functional association of erk1/2 with the ptp-sl and step protein tyrosine phosphatases (ptps).  human erythrocyte membranes exhibit, in addition to ""acid"" p-nitrophenyl-phosphatase activity, remarkable phosphotyrosyl-protein phosphatase activity, assayed on synthetic polymer poly (glu-tyr) 4:1, previously phosphorylated on tyr residues by rat spleen tyrosine-protein kinase.  multiple putative phosphorylation sites in the primary sequence led us to investigate whether phosphorylation effects the specificity and/or the kinetics of substrate cleavage.  egr-1, an immediate-early gene product and master regulator was originally described as a phosphoprotein following its discovery in the 1980s.  phosphorylation of wild-type recombinant egr-1 (as compared with ser26>ala26 mutant egr-1) revealed that ser26 accounts for the majority of phosphorylation of egr-1 by erk1.  these data suggest that substrate phosphorylation could be one of the mechanisms whereby some intracellular peptides would escape degradation and could be regulating protein interactions within cells.  recent analysis of epsp synthase by solid-state nmr has led to the postulation of a new enzyme reaction pathway and raised once again the question of an intermediate species covalently bound to the enzyme  in both rat pc12 and mouse att-20 cells, ep24.15 was serine-phosphorylated, and ep24.15 phosphate incorporation was enhanced by forskolin treatment, and attenuated by h89, consistent with pka-mediated phosphorylation.  a sequence of 16 amino acids in ptp-sl was identified as being critical for erk1/2 binding and termed kinase interaction motif (kim) (residues 224-239); it was shown to be required for phosphorylation of ptp-sl by erk1/2 at thr253.  posttranslational modification, such as phosphorylation, plays an essential role in regulating activation of endothelial no synthase (enos).  chemical modification of a protein surface, including phosphorylation, could alter the function of biological electron-transfer reactions. ||| ",yes
Is the gene CDKN2A nevogenic?,"the status of the cdkn2a gene family, including cdkn2a, cdkn2b, and cdkn2c, was investigated in 24 cases of neuroblastoma.  cdkn2a is an evolutionarily conserved gene encoding proteins implicated in tumor suppression, ocular development, aging, and metabolic diseases.  inactivation of the cdkn2a gene could lead to uncontrolled cell growth.  cdkn2a has been implicated as a melanoma susceptibility gene in some kindreds with a family history of this disease.  the genetic locus cdkn2a has been linked to familial melanoma, and mutations or deletions in its coding sequence are seen in some cases of sporadic and familial melanomas.  cdkn2a gene belongs to the genes involved in cell cycle regulation.  molecular genetic studies have revealed that deletions in cdkn2a occur frequently in cancer.  inactivation of cdkn2a gene is observed in many human malignancies, including larynx cancer.  cdkn2a is thought to be the main candidate gene for melanoma susceptibility.  homozygous deletions and mutations of the cdkn2a gene were not found.  absence of cdkn2a gene expression was shown in 27% (6/22) at mrna level and 21% (4/19) at protein level.  the cdkn2a/b locus contains crucial tumor suppressors and a lncrna gene anril.  these data suggest that the cdkn2a gene is involved in the tumorigenesis of ovarian cancer, but the mechanisms of cdkn2a gene inactivation in serous papillary ovarian cancer remains unclear.  this finding suggests the occurrence of a correlation between cdkn2b transcription and tumor phenotype.  in humans, the cdkn2a locus encodes two transcripts, ink4a and arf.  promoter hypermethylation of the cdkn2a gene has been suspected to be involved in the carcinogenesis of colorectal cancers.  deletion or mutations in the cdkn2a gene may produce an imbalance between functional p16 and cyclin d, causing abnormal cell growth.  finally, expression of the cdkn2b gene was demonstrated in all stage iv neuroblastomas, whereas none of stage i tumors expressed this gene.  novel rnas transcribed from the cdkn2a gene were screened by cdkn2a-specific rna capture deep-sequencing and confirmed by northern blotting and clone-sequencing.  the prevalence of cdkn2a mutation in our study was 4.5% (1/22) and there was a correlation between family history and probability of mutation detection. ||| ",yes
Is the gene DUX4 epigenetically regulated in somatic cells?,"in this review, we discuss multiple levels of control of dux4 expression, including enhancer-promoter interactions, dna methylation, histone modifications, noncoding rnas, and telomere positioning effect.  dux4 is normally expressed in the cleavage-stage embryo, whereas chromatin repression prevents dux4 expression in most somatic tissues.  dux4, a gene encoding a transcription factor involved in early embryogenesis, is located within the d4z4 subtelomeric repeat on chromosome 4q35.  this lead us to question ""could dux4 be a tf that is active in certain types of potent somatic cells?""  dux4 is an embryonic transcription factor (tf) later silenced in somatic tissues, while active in germline testis cells.  in most healthy somatic tissues, dux4 is heavily repressed by multiple genetic and epigenetic mechanisms, and its aberrant expression is linked to facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (fshd) where it has been extensively studied.  dux4's transcriptional activity has been extensively characterized, but the dux4-induced proteome remains undescribed.  a copy of dux4 is located within each unit of the d4z4 macrosatellite repeat array and its derepression in somatic cells is caused by either repeat array contraction (fshd1) or by mutations in the chromatin repressor smchd1 (fshd2).  dux4, a double homeobox transcription factor, has been mostly studied in facioscapulohumeral dystrophy (fshd), a pathology linked to a deletion of subtelomeric repeats on chromosome 4q.  recently, dux4 expression has been implicated in oncogenesis, although this is much less explored.  genomic profiling of dux4, histone h3, and h3 modifications reveals that dux4 binds two classes of loci: dnase accessible h3k27ac-rich chromatin and inaccessible h3k27ac-depleted malr-enriched chromatin.  with these results, novel expression for dux4 in hematopoietic tissue is described.  facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy is caused by incomplete epigenetic repression of the transcription factor dux4 in skeletal muscle.  embryonic cells, cancer cells and testis cells that show dux4 expression are pluri-multipotent cells.  regardless, the somatic cytotoxicity caused by dux4 expression is conserved when expressed in cells and animals ranging from fly to mouse.  dux4 positive stained cells were also detected by immunohistochemistry.  low levels and sporadic expression of dux4 have been reported in fshd biopsy samples and myoblast cultures.  dux4 binds sites in the human genome that contain a double-homeobox sequence motif, including sites in unique regions of the genome as well as many sites in repetitive elements.  dux4 is a transcription factor whose misexpression in skeletal muscle causes facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (fshd).  the human double-homeodomain retrogene dux4 is expressed in the testis and epigenetically repressed in somatic tissues. ||| ",yes
Is the gene MAOA epigenetically modified by methylation?,"maoa gene promoter methylation was compared between the case and control groups.  maoa genotypes modified few associations of methylation with sex and age.  meanwhile, we measured dna methylation in two regions of maoa (maoa-2 and maoa-3).  we conclude that methylation of maoa may play a significant role in common psychiatric illness and that further examination of epigenetic processes at this locus is in order.  epigenetic markers such as dna methylation of the monoamine oxidase a (maoa) gene have previously been shown to be altered in anxiety- and stress-related disorders and to constitute a potential mechanism of action of psychotherapeutic interventions such as cognitive behavioral therapy in these disorders.  significantly lower maoa promoter methylation was discerned in obsessive-compulsive disorder patients relative to healthy controls.  the promoter region of maoa gene was sequenced by methylation target technical method (methyltargettm), and 247 controls (204 males and 43 females) included in the study.  the present study for the first time, to our knowledge, investigated maoa methylation in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder applying a longitudinal psychotherapy-epigenetic approach.  dna methylation in the maoa promoter region was quantified by bisulfite pyrosequencing using genomic dna isolated from peripheral blood leukocytes.  methylation of the first exonic and partial first intronic region of maoa has been shown to strengthen associations of interactions of maoa-uvntr genotypes and adversity with aggression and substance misuse.  although the role of gene methylation in the development of schizophrenia is still unclear, our findings suggest that dna methylation of maoa may contribute to the onset of schizophrenia.  this study aims to elucidate the relationship between the methylation of the maoa gene promoter and schizophrenia.  methylated cytosine is an effector of epigenetic gene regulation.  the methylation of dna is an epigenetic modification that can play an important role in the control of gene expression in mammalian cells.  in the male schizophrenia group (bm) and the male control group (dm), maoa-2 and maoa-3 methylation were positively associated with schizophrenia.  results extend on prior studies by showing that women display higher levels of methylation than men within first intronic/exonic regions of maoa, which did not decrease with age in either sex.  this study investigates whether maoa promoter methylation is associated with atherosclerosis, and whether this association is confounded by familial factors in a monozygotic (mz) twin sample.  the present pilot data suggest maoa hypomethylation as a potential risk marker of obsessive-compulsive disorder and an increase in maoa methylation levels as a possible mechanistic correlate of response to cognitive behavioral therapy in obsessive-compulsive disorder.  maoa promoter methylation was analyzed via direct sequencing of sodium bisulfite-treated dna extracted from whole blood before and after an 8- to 10-week semi-standardized, obsessive-compulsive disorder-specific cognitive behavioral therapy.  dna methylation (5-methylcytosine ) is one of several epigenetic markers altered in alzheimer's disease (ad) brain. ||| ",yes
Is the gene SLC6A2 associated with orthostatic intolerance?,"elucidation of potential genetic contributions to orthostatic intolerance may inform therapeutic management and identification of individuals at risk.  in this article, we review the available literature correlating autoimmunity with orthostatic intolerance syndromes.  solute carrier (slc) 16a11 has been reported as a risk gene for type 2 diabetes (t2d).  in this study we investigate whether slc1a1 is associated with normal tension glaucoma in japanese patients.  genome-wide association studies reported slc22a2 variants to be associated with serum creatinine.  we sought to identify families with inherited autonomic dysfunction manifest as symptomatic orthostatic intolerance to characterize mode of inheritance and clinical features.  our findings suggested that the slc6a4 locus play a minor role, if any, in the pathogenesis of late-life mdd.  therefore, we performed an association analysis between the slc16a11 genotype and t2d pathology.  six single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) were detected in the slc16a11 gene, and five of them formed a haplotype (5snp haplotype).  we genotyped 12 single-nucleotide polymorphisms in slc1a1.  orthostatic intolerance is defined as the provocation of symptoms upon standing, commonly caused by neurogenic orthostatic hypotension (oh) and postural tachycardia syndrome (pots), the etiology for which has not been fully uncovered yet.  the slc16a11 genotype affected the values of laboratory parameters for t2d, particularly of blood lipids.  as slc22a2 encodes the organic cation transporter 2 (oct2), the association might be due to an effect on tubular creatinine handling.  comprehensive pedigree analysis of 16 families (39 individuals with orthostatic intolerance and 40 individuals suspected of having orthostatic intolerance) demonstrated dominant transmission of autonomic dysfunction with incomplete penetrance.  genotyping and haplotype estimation of the three markers rs4795541, rs140701, and rs3813034 spanning a 39-kb block the slc6a4 locus.  the function of slc16a11 may be related to lipid metabolism.  orthostatic intolerance is a debilitating syndrome characterized by tachycardia on assumption of upright posture.  the aim of this study was to explore the possible involvement of the slc6a4 locus in patients with late-life mdd by means of a haplotype-tagged approach.  thus, slc22a2 is associated with phenotypes of net tubular creatinine secretion and esrd.  bioinformatic analysis demonstrated that slc6a8 is highly expressed in nsclc and is related to poor prognosis. ||| ",yes
Is the length of the poly(A) tail involved in human disease?,"therefore, identifying alterations in poly(a) tail length can yield important insights into an mrna's function and subsequent physiological impact.  poly(a) tail length is a readout of an mrna's translatability and stability, especially in developmental systems.  poly(a) tail length is emerging as an important marker of mrna fate, where deviations from the canonical length can signal degradation or nuclear retention of transcripts.  poly(a) tail length plays an important role in mrna stability and translational control.  the length of the poly(a) tail influences the stability, nuclear export and translation of mrna transcripts.  three methods for measuring the length of a poly(a) tail are presented: the poly(a) length assay, the ligation-mediated poly(a) test (lm-pat), and the rnase h assay.  a characteristic aspect of poly(a) tail function is furthermore that it can be modulated by changes in its length.  poly(a) tails are important elements in mrna translation and stability, although recent genome-wide studies have concluded that poly(a) tail length is generally not associated with translational efficiency in nonembryonic cells.  the poly(a) tail is a homopolymeric stretch of adenosine at the 3'-end of mature rna transcripts and its length plays an important role in nuclear export, stability, and translational regulation of mrna.  in this review, we focus on the role of nab2 in poly(a) tail length control and speculate on potential mechanisms by which nab2 could regulate poly(a) tail length based on reported physical and genetic interactions.  a number of approaches have been developed to measure the length and position of the poly(a)-tail.  the poly(a) tail influences mrna translation and stability, but it is unclear whether there are global roles of poly(a)-tail lengths in cell stress.  control of poly(a) tail length is thus an important mechanism to regulate the abundance and ultimate translation of transcripts.  poly(a) polymerases add the poly(a) tail at the 3' end of nearly all eukaryotic mrna, and are associated with proliferation and cancer.  poly(a) tails enhance the stability and translation of most eukaryotic messenger rnas, but difficulties in globally measuring poly(a)-tail lengths have impeded greater understanding of poly(a)-tail function.  poly(a) tails are critical for mrna stability and translation.  in the cytoplasm, the poly(a) tail promotes both mrna stability and translation, and these functions are frequently regulated through changes in tail length.  understanding the global regulation of poly(a) tail length will require dissecting the contributions of enzymes, regulatory factors, and poly(a) binding proteins (pabs) that all cooperate to regulate polyadenylation.  it measures poly(a) tail length from both native rna and dna sequencing, which makes poly(a) tail studies by full-length cdna approaches possible for the first time.  a segmented poly(a) tail is characterized in that it consists of at least two a-containing elements, each defined as a nucleotide sequence consisting of 40-60 adenosines, separated by a spacer element of different length. ||| ",yes
Is the microRNA 132 (miR-132) involved in brain pathologies?,"mir-132 can influence the pathogenesis of many diseases, especially in the nervous system.  microrna-132 (mir-132) is involved in prosurvival, anti-inflammatory and memory-promoting functions in the nervous system and has been found consistently downregulated in alzheimer's disease (ad).  mir-132 is enriched in the central nerve system and is thought to be involved in neuronal development, maturation and function, and to be associated with several neurological disorders including alzheimer's disease.  recently, it has been reported that the microrna-132(mir-132) is linked with synaptic plasticity and cognitive impairment.  the dysregulation of mir-132 results in the occurrence and exacerbation of neural developmental, degenerative diseases, like alzheimer's disease, parkinson's disease and epilepsy, neural infection and psychiatric disorders including disturbance of consciousness, cognition and memory, depression and schizophrenia.  this review aims to discuss the clinical potentials of mir-132 in the nervous system.  microrna-132 (mir-132) has been shown to participate in many diseases.  microrna-132 (mir-132) has been demonstrated to affect multiple neuronal functions, including dendritic growth and spinogenesis in cultured neurons and brain slices, as well as learning behavior of animals.  whether and how mir-132 contributes to pathology in these neurodegenerative diseases remains unclear.  recently, the link between dysregulation of mir-124 and cns disorders, such as neurodegeneration, cns stress, neuroimmune disorders, stroke, and brain tumors, has become evident.  as a brain-specific mirna, mir-132 has been well studied in mature neurons.  this study aimed to understand the correlation between the level of mir-132 and the severity of dementia post-ischemic stroke.  in this study, we explored the role of mir-130b in cerebral ischemia injury and investigated its potential mechanism.  in addition to its documented neuronal functions, an emerging role for mir-132 in tumorigenesis has been suggested.  mir-132 could impair neuronal differentiation but promote glial cell differentiation by regulating mecp2 expression.  in the nervous system, mir-132 is significant for regulating neuronal differentiation, maturation and functioning, and widely participates in axon growth, neural migration, and plasticity.  these results indicated that there was a substantial correlation between serum mir-132 expression and post-stroke cognitive functionality, suggesting that mir-132 may be a risk marker for psci.  collectively, our results suggest that mir137 plays essential roles in postnatal neurodevelopment and that dysregulation of mir-137 potentially contributes to neuropsychiatric disorders in humans.  here, we provide an overview of the specific molecular function of mir-124 in the cns and a revealing insight for the therapeutic potential of mir-124 in the treatment of human cns diseases.  microrna-134 (mir-134) has been reported to be a brain-specific mirna and is differently expressed in brain tissues subjected to ischemic injury. ||| ",yes
Is the monoclonal antibody Trastuzumab (Herceptin) of potential use in the treatment of prostate cancer?,"to investigate the efficacy and toxicity of the antibody to the her-2/neu receptor (trastuzumab, herceptin) in the treatment of advanced hormone-refractory prostate cancer (hrpc).  trastuzumab (herceptin) is a humanized anti-her-2/neu monoclonal antibody for breast cancer treatment.  trastuzumab (herceptin) is a recombinant humanised igg1 monoclonal antibody against the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (her2), used for metastatic breast cancer treatment.  trastuzumab (herceptin), a humanized igg1 antibody raised against the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (her2/neu), is the main antibody in clinical use against breast cancer.  the humanized monoclonal antibody, trastuzumab (herceptin), directed against her2/neu, has been effective in the treatment of breast cancer malignancies.  trastuzumab (herceptin(®)) is a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds selectively to human epidermal growth factor 2 (her2), interfering with its downstream cancer-promoting effects.  her-2 has been implicated in the oncogenesis of human prostate cancer (cap) and is the target of a new treatment for metastatic breast cancer using the humanised monoclonal antibody (mab) trastuzumab (herceptin).  the recombinant humanized anti-her-2 monoclonal antibody, trastuzumab (herceptin) was approved for clinical use in the us in 1998.  these studies suggest that (225)ac-labeled trastuzumab may be a potent therapeutic agent against metastatic breast cancer cells exhibiting intermediate to high her2/neu expression.  a phase i study was designed to evaluate docetaxel/estramustine plus trastuzumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds to the her2 receptor, in patients with metastatic androgen-independent prostate cancer (aipc).  trastuzumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (her2/erbb-2), has become the mainstay of treatment for her2-positive breast cancer.  trastuzumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against the extracellular domain of the her2 oncoprotein, can effectively target her2-positive breast cancer through several mechanisms.  trastuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody to the her-2 receptor and has activity against her-2-positive breast carcinoma, more so when combined with a taxane.  the recombinant humanized anti-her-2 monoclonal antibody, trastuzumab (herceptin) is now available for clinical use in the u.s.a.  trastuzumab (herceptin) as a single agent demonstrated poor efficacy in treating hrpc.  the strategy utilizing trastuzumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against human epidermal growth receptor 2 (her-2), as a therapeutic agent in her-2 positive breast cancer therapy seems to have advantage over traditional chemotherapy, especially when given in combination with anticancer drugs.  trastuzumab in combination with cisplatin and a fluoropyrimidine is an effective regimen for patients with her2-positive advanced gastric cancer, has acceptable tolerability and represents an important advance in the treatment of gastric cancer.  the her-2/neu protein is overexpressed in many human carcinomas obtained from different tissues and may represent a useful target for therapy with the commercially available monoclonal antibody trastuzumab (herceptin).  the authors screened for her-2 overexpression in patients developing hormone-refractory prostate carcinoma (hrpc) and conducted a phase ii trial of trastuzumab plus docetaxel in her-2-positive patients.  radiolabeled trastuzumab has been considered previously as a potential agent for radioimmunotherapy. ||| ",yes
Is the mouse Sry gene locus free of repetitive sequences?,"the mouse genomic sry locus is characterized by two arms of a large inverted repeat, flanking a unique region that, between an acceptor and a donor splice site, contains a single exon encoding the sry protein.  detailed analysis of the sry genomic locus reveals a further difference in that the mouse sry open reading frame lies within 2.8 kilobases of unique sequence at the center of a large inverted repeat.  the q-rich domain of the mouse sex determining gene, sry, is encoded by an in-frame insertion of a repetitive sequence composed of mostly cag repeats.  the testis-determining gene sry is located on the short arm of the mouse y chromosome in a region known to have undergone duplications and rearrangements in comparison with the equivalent portion of the human y chromosome.  dna sequence comparisons with other rodents with multiple sry copies are inconsistent in divergence patterns and functionality of the multiple copies.  recombination involving the repeat region may have led to an 11-kilobase deletion, precisely excising sry in a line of xy female mice.  we investigated the rate and pattern of evolution for the coding sequence of sry in old world mice and rats (subfamily murinae).  we have performed dideoxy sequencing or restriction enzyme digestion of sry sequences amplified by pcr from a variety of inbred strains and species of mice.  this repeat, which is found in both mus musculus musculus and mus musculus domesticus y chromosomes, is not present at the human sry locus.  to address hypotheses of divergence, gene conversion and functional constraints, we sequenced sry loci from a single r. norvegicus y chromosome from the spontaneously hypertensive rat strain (shr) and analyzed dna sequences for homology among copies.  here, we identified a cryptic second exon of mouse sry and a corresponding two-exon type sry (sry-t) transcript.  in germ cells from the adult mouse testis, sry rna is a circular molecule, which is generated by an inverted splicing event that utilizes the above-mentioned splice sites.  xy(d1) mice develop as females because sry is inactivated, probably because it is now juxtaposed to centromeric heterochromatin.  mouse sry is unusual in that it includes a c-terminal polyglutamine (polyq) tract that is absent in nonrodent sry proteins, and yet, paradoxically, is essential for male sex determination.  the laboratory rat, rattus norvegicus, has multiple y chromosome copies of sry while most mammals have only a single copy.  the mouse testis determining gene sry is expressed in somatic cells of the differentiating male gonad as a linear transcript, encoding a transcription factor containing an hmg box.  the shr y chromosome contains at least 6 full length copies of the sry gene.  in the mouse, sry is expressed by germ cells in the adult testis and by somatic cells in the genital ridge.  sry is the y-chromosomal gene that is pivotal in the determination of sex in mammals, however the structure of the sry transcript produced in the embryo has not been determined.  the function of sry for inducing a male gonad was identified due to a development of a transgenic xx male mouse with testes by introducing a single gene into an embryo. ||| ",no
Is the number of described human nuclear mutations less than 50000?,"the number of known mutations in human nuclear genes, underlying or associated with human inherited disease, has now exceeded 100,000 in more than 3700 different genes (human gene mutation database).  knowledge of the kinds and numbers of nuclear point mutations in human tissues is essential to the understanding of the mutation mechanisms underlying genetic diseases.  in human tissues, somatic point mutations have been observed at fractions at or below 4/10,000 and 5/100,000 in mitochondrial and nuclear dna, respectively.  in particular, the mutation rate observed in modern humans is substantially lower than that estimated from calibration against the fossil record, and the paternal age effect in mutations transmitted to offspring is much weaker than expected from our long-standing model of spermatogenesis.  we have now developed a means to scan for point mutations in 100 bp nuclear single copy sequences at mutant fractions as low as 10(-6).  high throughput means to detect and quantify low-frequency mutations (<10(-2) ) in the dna-coding sequences of human tissues and pathological lesions are required to discover the kinds, numbers, and rates of genetic mutations that (i) confer inherited risk for disease or (ii) arise in somatic tissues as events required for clonal diseases such as cancers and atherosclerotic plaque.while throughput of linear dna sequencing methods has increased dramatically, such methods are limited by high error rates (>10(-3) ) rendering them unsuitable for the detection of low-frequency risk-conferring mutations among the many neutral mutations carried in the general population or formed in tissue growth and development.  mutations cause or influence the prevalence of many diseases.  infrequent and rare genetic variants in the human population vastly outnumber common ones.  genome sequencing studies of de novo mutations in humans have revealed surprising incongruities in our understanding of human germline mutation.  recent studies show that variants altering amino acid sequence and protein function are enriched at low variant allele frequency, 2 to 5%, but because of insufficient sample size it is not clear if the same trend holds for rare variants below 1% allele frequency.  both nuclear and mitochondrial point mutations have been measured in human cells and tissues at fractions approaching 10(-6) using constant denaturant capillary electrophoresis (cdce) coupled with high-fidelity pcr (hifipcr).  mitochondrial dna (mtdna) diseases are rare disorders whose prevalence is estimated around 1 in 5000.  copy number variations (cnvs) comprise about 10% of reported disease-causing mutations in mendelian disorders.  part of the difficulty is that mutations occur very rarely, and so direct pedigree-based approaches remain limited in the numbers that they can examine.  this translates to an estimate of 1.7 for the ratio of the male to female mutation rate, much less than the average 5.1 of previous studies.  additionally, rare inherited mutations may be scanned in pooled dna samples, each derived from as many as 10(5) persons.  7.4% of deleterious mutations and 22.4% of novel putative mutations were identified.  rare coding variants constitute an important class of human genetic variation, but are underrepresented in current databases that are based on small population samples.  the authors argue that this throws doubt not only on higher male mutation rates in human ancestry, but also on the standard assumption of a high male:female ratio in contemporary human populations.  however, for a variety of reasons, this figure is likely to represent only a small proportion of the clinically relevant genetic variants that remain to be identified in the human genome (the 'mutome'). ||| ",no
Is the optogenetics tool ChR2 light-sensitive?,"the most widely used optogenetic tool, channelrhodopsin2 (chr2), is both light- and voltage-sensitive.  channelrhodopsin 2 (chr2) is the most commonly used tool in optogenetics.  channelrhodopsin-2 (chr2), a light-activated cation-selective ion channel, has been widely used as a tool in optogenetic research.  chr2 is specifically sensitive to wavelengths less than 550 nm.  optogenetic tools, such as channelrhodopsin2 (chr2), have enabled the behavior of whole organisms by light-mediated manipulation of neuronal activities.  the optogenetic tool channelrhodopsin-2 (chr2) is widely used to excite neurons to study neural circuits.  optogenetics is an emerging method that uses light to manipulate electrical activity in excitable cells exploiting the interaction between light and light-sensitive depolarizing ion channels, such as channelrhodopsin-2 (chr2).  because of its faster photocycle compared to wild-type (wt) chr2, the e123t mutant of chr2 is a useful optogenetic tool when fast neuronal stimulation is needed.  channelrhodopsin 2 (chr2) is a light-gated ion channel and an important tool in optogenetics.  optogenetic manipulation of cells or living organisms became widely used in neuroscience following the introduction of the light-gated ion channel channelrhodopsin-2 (chr2).  these findings indicate that chr2 expression methods and light stimulation techniques influence synaptic responses in a neuron-specific manner.  the most widely used of these optogenetic tools is the light-gated ion channel, channelrhodopsin 2 (chr2).  other unique features and the applicability of gt_ccr4 for optogenetics were discussed.  although chr2 has been extensively used as an optogenetic tool in neuroscience research, the molecular mechanism of cation channel formation following retinal photoisomerization in chr2 is not well understood.  in hek293 cells stably expressing chr2, photocurrents were elicited at stimuli of 400-550 nm, and the wavelength sensitivity range was expanded by the additional transduction of the modified volvox channelrhodopsin-1 (mvchr1) gene, which has broad wavelength sensitivities, ranging from 400 to 600 nm.  channelrhodopsin-2 (chr2) is a light-activated and non-selective cationic channel protein that can be easily expressed in specific neurons to control neuronal activity by light.  understanding the rpsb photoisomerization mechanism in chr2 mutants will provide molecular-level insights into how chr2 photochemical reactivity can be controlled, which will lay the foundation for improving the design of optogenetic tools.  optogenetics is a growing technique which allows manipulation of biological events simply by illumination.  the light-gated ion channel channelrhodopsin 2 (chr2) from chlamydomonas reinhardtii is a major optogenetic tool.  the discovery of the light-gated ion channel channelrhodopsin (chr) set the stage for the novel field of optogenetics, where cellular processes are controlled by light. ||| ",yes
Is the petrous bone used in ancient DNA sampling?,"because the practice of forensic genetics responds to different imperatives, we implemented a study aimed at (i) understanding how and why the petrous bone is an advantageous substrate in ancient dna studies and (ii) establishing whether it is advantageous in forensic str typing.  our primary aim is to assess the applicability of a petrous bone sampling method in combination with next generation sequencing to evaluate the quality and quantity of dna in taphonomically degraded petrous bones from forensic and cemetery cases.  the petrous portion of the temporal bone has been shown to be the most suitable skeletal part for sampling archaeological skeletons, and it has also been used successfully in some forensic cases.  over the last few years, palaeogenomic studies of the petrous bone (the densest part of the temporal bone) have shown that it is a source of dna in both larger quantities and of better quality than other bones.  in contrast, no pathogen dna has been reported from the petrous bone which has become the most desired skeletal element in ancient dna research due to its high endogenous dna content.  the significant role of the petrous bone in sex assessment of skeletal human remains has been highlighted by several studies.  therefore, it appears that despite the necessity of analysing longer fragments in forensic str typing compared to ngs palaeogenomics, the use of petrous bones in forensic genetics could prove valuable, especially in cases involving infants, toothless individuals or very degraded skeletal remains.  our results imply that although petrous bones are highly valuable for ancient genomic analyses as an excellent source of endogenous dna, the metagenomic potential of these dense skeletal elements is highly limited.  this paper aims to outline the possible biases of utilizing petrous bones to undertake adna analyses and highlight how these complications may potentially be overcome in future research.  a large proportion of adna work now utilizes the petrous portion of the temporal bone (pars petrosa), which is recognized as an excellent skeletal element for long-term ancient endogenous (host) dna survival.  through comparison of human dna content and quality we confirm best performance of the petrous pyramid and identify seven additional sampling locations across four skeletal elements that yield adequate adna for most applications in human palaeogenetics.  currently, the cochlea, part of the osseous inner ear located inside the petrous pyramid, is the most sought after skeletal element for molecular analyses of ancient humans as it has been shown to yield high amounts of endogenous dna.  for this reason, we were more likely to obtain a complete str profile from petrous bone material, increasing the chance of identification in a forensic setting.  to further improve the sampling strategy in dna analysis of aged skeletal remains, a comparison between 26 petrous bones and 30 metacarpals iii from second world war skeletons was made considering intra-bone dna yield variability.  we selected 50 individual skeletal remains and extracted dna from one tooth and one petrous bone from each.  using a systematic process of bone removal based on distinct anatomical landmarks and the identification of relevant morphological features, a petrous pyramid is cleaned with a sandblaster, and the cochlea is located, isolated, and reduced to a homogeneous bone powder.  histological analyses revealed peculiar microstructural characteristics (tissue organization), unique to the petrous bone, that might explain the good preservation of dna in that substrate.  we also performed histological analyses to compare (i) the microscopic structure of a petrous bone and of a tooth and (ii) the microscopic structure of fresh petrous bone and of an archaeological or forensic sample.  here, an ancient dna methodology using high-throughput sequencing is developed to survey and analyse thousands of archaeological bones from southwest australia.  we show that the rfu intensities read on str profiles are systematically higher in experiments using dna extracted from petrous bones rather than teeth. ||| ",yes
Is the protein FAK (Focal Adhesion Kinase) phosphorylated?,"focal adhesion kinase (fak) is phosphorylated on tyrosine and serine residues after cell activation.  focal adhesion kinase (fak) is a tyrosine kinase whose phosphorylation state and activity is tightly linked to cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix through integrin receptors.  focal adhesion kinase (fak) is a tyrosine kinase ubiquitously expressed in cells.  focal adhesion kinase (p125fak; fak) is a protein tyrosine kinase that is tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to v-src-mediated transformation, cell adhesion, and stimulation with neuropeptides.  focal adhesion kinase (fak) is a widely expressed nonreceptor tyrosine kinase found in focal adhesions.  focal adhesion kinase (fak) is a non-receptor protein tyrosine kinase (ptk) which acts as an early modulator in the integrin signaling cascade.  focal adhesion kinase (fak) is a member of a growing family of non-receptor protein tyrosine kinases.  it has been proposed that the focal adhesion kinase (fak) mediates focal adhesion formation through tyrosine phosphorylation during cell adhesion.  focal adhesion kinase (p125(fak); 'fak') is a tyrosine kinase that is localised to cellular focal adhesions and is associated with a number of other proteins, such as integrin adhesion receptors.  focal adhesion kinase (fak) phosphorylation contributes to the regulation of growth factors that promote cellular adhesion, mobility, and survival, being a key factor in tumor development.  focal adhesion kinase (fak) is a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase implicated in the signal transduction pathways initiated by integrins.  focal adhesion kinase (fak or pp125fak) is a cytosolic protein tyrosine kinase which plays an important role in integrin-mediated signal transduction.  these results indicate that fak mediates adhesion-associated tyrosine phosphorylation, but not the formation of focal adhesions.  fak is localized to focal adhesions and is centrally implicated in the regulation of cell motility and adhesion.  fak is also highly phosphorylated during early development.  phosphorylation of fak at various tyrosine residues regulates focal adhesion turnover by mechanisms that are not well understood.  our data show that phosphorylation of fak at tyr-397 is a key determinant of how fak controls focal adhesion turnover.  the intracellular protein tyrosine kinase fak (focal adhesion kinase) was originally identified gy its high level of tyrosine phosphorylation in v-src-transformed cells.  we made a fluorescent fak mutant (y397f-fak/ycam) to analyse, in living cells, how phosphorylation of fak regulates the turnover of focal adhesions.  one of the major tyrosine phosphorylation activities linked to integrin signalling is that of focal adhesion kinase (fak). ||| ",yes
Is the protein KCNQ2 associated with idiopathic epilepsy?,"the potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily q member 2 (kcnq2) gene has been reported to be associated with various types of epilepsy, including benign familial neonatal seizure (bfns), early infantile epileptic encephalopathy (eiee), and unclassified early onset encephalopathies.  classically, mutations in this gene have been associated with benign familial neonatal seizures, however, in recent years kcnq2 mutations have been reported associated to early-onset epileptic encephalopathy.  we report clinical, genetic, and functional data from a family in which early onset epilepsy and neurocognitive deficits segregated with a novel mutation in kcnq3 (c.989g>t; p.r330l).  spontaneous mutations one of the kcnq2 genes cause disorders of neural excitability such as benign familial neonatal seizures.  mutations in the kcnq2 gene encoding the voltage-dependent potassium m channel kv7.2 subunit cause either benign epilepsy or early onset epileptic encephalopathy (eoee).  our results do not provide evidence that allelic variation of the kcnq2 gene contributes a common and relevant effect to the pathogenesis of common subtypes of idiopathic generalized epilepsy.  the underlying genetic abnormalities of rare familial idiopathic epilepsy have been identified, such as mutation in kcnq2, a k(+) channel gene.  in this work, detailed familiar, clinical and genetic data were collected for 13 kcnq2-positive patients revealed among a cohort of 80 epileptic pediatric probands from spain who were analyzed through a targeted next-generation sequencing assay for 155 epilepsy-associated genes.  heterozygous mutations in the kcnq3 gene on chromosome 8q24 encoding the voltage-gated potassium channel kv7.3 subunit have previously been associated with rolandic epilepsy and idiopathic generalized epilepsy (ige) including benign neonatal convulsions.  mutations in the kcnq2 gene lead to a form of neonatal epilepsy in humans termed 'benign familial neonatal convulsions', which is characterized by hyperexcitability of neurons.  mutations in the kcnq2 gene, encoding for voltage-gated kv7.2k(+) channel subunits, are responsible for early-onset epileptic diseases with widely-diverging phenotypic presentation, ranging from benign familial neonatal seizures (bfns) to epileptic encephalopathy.  mutations in the voltage gated potassium channel gene kcnq2 and the homologous gene kcnq3 have been found to cause a rare monogenic subtype of idiopathic generalized epilepsy, the benign familial neonatal convulsions.  it also demonstrates that kcnq2 mutations contribute to an important percentage of spanish patients with epilepsy.  mutations in the kcnq2 gene encoding for voltage-gated potassium channel subunits have been found in patients affected with early onset epilepsies with wide phenotypic heterogeneity, ranging from benign familial neonatal seizures (bfns) to epileptic encephalopathy with cognitive impairment, drug resistance, and characteristic electroencephalography (eeg) and neuroradiologic features.  mutations in kcna2 gene, encoding for the voltage-gated k+ channel kv1.2, has been reported to be associated with epilepsy disorders.  kcnq2-related diseases range from autosomal dominant neonatal self-limited epilepsy, often caused by kcnq2 haploinsufficiency, to severe encephalopathies caused by kcnq2 missense variants.  by performing a systematic mutation scan of the coding region and an association study involving a frequent thr752asn substitution polymorphism, we, therefore, investigated whether allelic variation of the kcnq2 gene confers susceptibility to common subtypes of idiopathic generalized epilepsy.  furthermore, kcnq2 appears to be a causative gene for eme.  kcnq2 is closely related to neuronal excitatory diseases including epilepsy and neuropathic pain, and also acts as a drug target of the anti-epileptic drug, retigabine (rtg).  mutations in the kcnq2 gene cause myokymia and neonatal epilepsy, indicating that this k(+) channel regulates the excitability of lower motoneurons and cns neurons. ||| ",yes
Is the protein Papilin secreted?,"pancreatic stone protein (psp/reg) is a constitutively secreted protein in pancreatic juice.  rat pancreatitis-associated protein (pap) is an additional protein appearing in pancreatic juice after induction of prancreatic inflammation.  pap is a 16 kda secretory protein structurally related to the c-type lectins although classical lectin-related function has not been reported yet.  it is precursor to a spontaneously precipitating peptide called pancreatic thread protein, which is found in protein plugs within the pancreatic ductal system.  pancreatitis-associated protein 1 (pap1) belongs to the reg family of secretory proteins.  pancreatitis-associated protein (pap) belongs to the same family of proteins.  pancreatitis-associated protein (pap) was discovered in the pancreatic juice of rats with acute pancreatitis.  pancreatic stone protein/reg protein (psp/reg) is a secretory pancreatic protein of hitherto unknown function.  pancreatic concentration of pap mrna increased more than 300 x within 12 h whereas concentrations of mrnas encoding major secretory proteins such as amylase decreased.  pap is highly increased during acute pancreatitis, while no exact data exist regarding psp/reg protein synthesis and secretion.  although parvulin (par14/eukaryotic parvulin homolog), a peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase, is found associated with the preribosomal ribonucleoprotein (pre-rrnp) complexes, its roles in ribosome biogenesis remain undetermined.  the deduced amino acid sequence revealed that pap was synthetized as a preprotein with, in its mature form, a predicted molecular weight of 16,630.  pol peptide, an oligopeptide corresponding to the 27 c-terminal amino acids of dna polymerase from herpes simplex virus type 1, has recently been suggested to translocate from endosomal compartments into the cytosol after being intracellularly delivered via a protein carrier.  although the posterior pituitary is known to contain the prl releasing activity or factor (prf), its chemical identification has been a matter of dispute.  profilin was first identified as an actin monomer binding protein; however, recent reports indicate its involvement in actin polymerization.  the regulation of psp/reg thus differs from that of most other pancreatic secretory proteins.  paxillin (pxn) is a focal adhesion protein that has been implicated in signal transduction from the extracellular matrix.  pirin is a novel highly conserved nuclear protein, but very little is known about its cellular function.  in a diet study with rats, we tested the hypothesis that protein malnutrition leads to increased psp/reg concentrations in pancreatic juice.  in our present study, we found that paip1 was over-expressed in human pc tissues. ||| ",yes
Is the protein lefty an inhibitor of nodal?,"processed forms of lefty proteins, both smaller and larger forms, inhibited nodal signalling.  the expression of lefty, an inhibitor of nodal is often reduced in tumor cells.  genetic data suggest that nodal is a signalling molecule, while lefty is an antagonist of nodal, but their precise function remains unknown.  such lefty-induced inhibition was rescued by excess actriia or actriib, suggesting that lefty antagonizes nodal signalling through competitive binding to the common receptor actriia or actriib.  efficient inhibition of nodal signals by lefty may involve competitive binding of lefty to the common receptors and faster diffusion of lefty.  furthermore, lefty overexpression in rcc cells inhibited the expression of nodal.  nodal downregulation and lefty overexpression led to similar observations: the inhibition of rcc cell proliferation and invasion, and the promotion of rcc cell apoptosis.  lefty, antivin and related genes act in a feedback inhibition mechanism for nodal signaling at a number of stages of vertebrate embryogenesis.  the expression of lefty in rcc cells was lower than that in adjacent non-tumor cells, which may result in the overexpression of nodal, thereby promoting the growth of rcc.  these data indicate that chordin and noggin function to limit bmp signaling in the left lpm, thereby derepressing nodal expression.  behaviours of gfp-nodal and gfp-lefty2 proteins were also investigated in chick embryos.  to the best of our knowledge, few studies have investigated the expression of nodal and lefty in renal cell carcinoma (rcc) cells.  two tgfbeta-related proteins, nodal and lefty, are implicated in early embryonic patterning of vertebrates.  in the present study, quantitative polymerase chain reaction assays demonstrated that the level of nodal expression in rcc cells was high compared with that of adjacent non-tumor tissue cells, while the opposite pattern was observed for the level of lefty expression.  expression of dominant negative mutants of various receptors indicated that alk4, and either actriia or actriib, function as type i and type ii receptors for nodal, respectively.  expression of the nodal gene is high in a number of tumor cell types and may promote tumor growth.  nodal may also act as a short-range signal to establish a functional midline barrier.  our findings confirm that the mouse node is instrumental in initiating left-right axis specification and identify nodal as the key morphogen regulating this process.  the signalling pathway of nodal was investigated with the use of a nodal-responsive assay system based on frog animal caps.  embryos lacking nodal in the node fail to initiate molecular asymmetry in the left lateral plate mesoderm and exhibit multiple left-right patterning defects. ||| ",yes
Is the protein pelota a ribosomal rescue factor?,"here we demonstrate that psrp1 is not a bona fide ribosomal protein, but rather a functional homologue of the escherichia coli cold-shock protein py.  these results suggest a novel function for ef-g and rrf in the post-stress return of psrp1/py-inactivated ribosomes to the actively translating pool.  ribosomal protein p0 is one of the highly conserved phosphorylated proteins in the large subunit of eukaryotic ribosomes.  furthermore, similarly to trnas, psrp1/py is recycled from the ribosome by the concerted action of the ribosome-recycling factor (rrf) and elongation factor g (ef-g).  rps27l (ribosomal protein s27-like) is an evolutionarily conserved ribosomal protein and a direct p53 target.  ribosomal phosphoprotein p1 (rpp1) is acidic phosphoprotein which in association with neutral phosphoprotein p0 and acidic phosphoprotein p2 forms ribosomal p protein complex as (p1)2-p0-(p2)2.  during protein synthesis, ribosomes become stalled on polyproline-containing sequences, unless they are rescued in archaea and eukaryotes by the initiation factor 5a (a/eif-5a) and in bacteria by the homologous protein ef-p.  the ribosomal phosphoprotein p0 of the human malarial parasite plasmodium falciparum (pfp0) has been identified as a protective surface protein.  ribosomal protein p0 forms a pentameric complex with two heterodimers of the flexible stalk proteins p1•p2 and plays a role in the functional interaction of eukaryotic ribosomes with translational factors.  ribonuclease p (rnase p) is a ribonucleoprotein comprised of a catalytic rna subunit and one or several protein subunits.  we also report that p97 binds eif2beta through its c-terminal domain and localizes to ribosome through its n-terminal mif4g domain.  psrp1 induces conformational changes within ribosomal components that comprise several intersubunit bridges, including bridge b2a, thereby stabilizes the ribosome against dissociation.  these findings would support a model whereby eif-5a stimulates peptide bond formation on polyproline-stalled ribosomes by stabilizing and orienting the cca-end of the p-trna, rather than by directly contributing to the catalysis.  we propose that par14 is a component of the pre-rrna complexes and functions as an rrna processing factor in ribosome biogenesis.  the ribosomal function of p0 is mediated at the stalk of the large ribosomal subunit at the gtpase centre, where the elongation factor eef2 binds.  three-dimensional cryo-electron microscopic (cryo-em) reconstructions reveal that, like py, psrp1 binds within the intersubunit space of the 70s ribosome, at a site overlapping the positions of mrna and a- and p-site trnas.  this chaperonin is implicated in the folding and assembly of the enzyme ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase and in the folding of proteins imported into plastids from the cytosol.  we find that the presence of psrp1/py lowers the binding of trna to the ribosome.  we give evidence that, although par14 exists in both the phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms in the cell, only the latter form is associated with the pre-40 s and pre-60 s ribosomal complexes.  we recently reported that rps27l disruption triggers ribosomal stress to induce p53, causing postnatal death, which can be rescued by trp53 +/- . ||| ",yes
Is the protein product of the cylindromatosis gene (CYLD) a deubiquitinating enzyme?,"cylindromatosis (cyld) is a deubiquitinating enzyme that is altered in patients with familial cylindromatosis, a condition characterized by numerous benign adnexal tumors.  here, we examined the potential role of the deubiquitinating enzyme cyld (cylindromatosis), mutation of which has been reported to cause familial cylindromatosis.  cyld is a deubiquitylase with tumor suppressor functions, first identified in patients with familial cylindromatosis.  the cylindromatosis gene (cyld) encodes a deubiquitinase that was initially             identified as a tumor suppressor and has recently been investigated in connection             with a variety of normal physiological processes.  the tumor-suppressor cylindromatosis (cyld) is a deubiquitinating enzyme and key regulator of cell proliferation and inflammation.  loss of the deubiquitinating activity of cyld correlates with tumorigenesis.  cyld has deubiquitinating enzyme activity and inhibits the activation of transcription factor nf-kappab.  loss of the deubiquitinating activity of cyld is correlated with tumorigenesis.  we demonstrate that the protein product of drosophila cyld (cyld), like its mammalian counterpart, is a deubiquitylating enzyme.  cyld, a tumor suppressor gene, has deubiquitinating enzyme activity and inhibits the activation of transcription factor nf-kappab.  the cyld gene product is a deubiquitinating enzyme that was shown to regulate cell proliferation, cell survival and inflammatory responses, mainly through inhibiting nf-kappab signalling.  cyld is a deubiquitination enzyme that regulates different cellular processes, such as cell proliferation and cell survival.  as a deubiquitination enzyme, cyld regulates the proliferation, development and activation of lymphoid cells.  recent studies suggest that transfected cyld has deubiquitinating enzyme activity and inhibits the activation of transcription factor nf-kappab.  it encodes a deubiquitylating enzyme (cyld) that is a negative regulator of the nf-kappab and jnk signaling pathways, in vitro.  the cyld gene encodes a deubiquitinating enzyme that removes lys-63-linked ubiquitin chains from i kappa b kinase signaling components and thereby inhibits nf-kappab pathway activation.  the cylindromatosis tumor suppressor gene (cyld) encodes an enzyme (cyld) with deubiquitinating activity that has been implicated in the regulation of thymocyte selection in an nf-κb-essential-modulator (nemo)-dependent manner.  here we show that cyld is a deubiquitinating enzyme that negatively regulates activation of the transcription factor nf-kappab by specific tumour-necrosis factor receptors (tnfrs).  the cyld lysine 63 deubiquitinase gene (cyld) encodes tumor suppressor protein that is mutated in familial cylindromatosus, and variants have been associated with crohn disease (cd).  familial cylindromatosis is caused by mutations in a gene encoding the cyld protein of previously unknown function. ||| ",yes
Is the protein β1-integrin recycled?,"some integrins, including beta1 integrins, are known to undergo constitutive endocytosis and recycling.  pathways selectively regulating β1-integrin recycling are implicated in cancer invasion and metastasis, yet proteins required for the internalization of this pro-invasive integrin remain to be identified.  functionally, rabgap1 facilitates active β1 integrin recycling to the plasma membrane through attenuation of rab11 activity.  here we assign a pivotal role for rabgap1 (gapcena) in the recycling of endocytosed active β1 integrins to the plasma membrane.  β1 integrins share the rab11 recycling machinery, but the trafficking of α3β1 and α6β1 are distinct by an unknown mechanism.  upon ligand binding in various cells, the β1 integrin is internalized, traffics to early endosomes, and is returned to the plasma membrane through recycling endosomes.  the laminin-binding integrins, α3β1 and α6β1, are needed for tumor metastasis and their surface expression is regulated by endocytic recycling.  upon continuous ligand stimulation, β1-ar is internalized and mostly recycled back to the plasma membrane (pm).  taken together, these data demonstrate that α6β1 is distinct from α3β1 via rab11-fip5 recycling and recycles in an unexpected cell-cell location.implications: rab11-fip5-dependent α6β1 integrin recycling may be selectively targeted to limit migration of prostate cancer cells into laminin-rich tissues.  rab11-fip5 and its membrane-binding domain were required for α6β1 recycling, without affecting the other laminin-binding integrin (i.e., α3β1) or unrelated membrane receptors like cd44, transferrin receptor, or e-cadherin.  despite the established role of integrin β4 (itg β4) in breast cancer progression, the importance of endocytic recycling of itg β4 and its regulatory mechanism are poorly understood.  the beta1 integrin is a well-known regulator of beta cell activities; however, little is known of its associated alpha subunits.  integrin endocytosis/recycling has been implicated in the regulation of cell migration.  integrin β1 is known to be involved in differentiation, migration, proliferation, wound repair, tissue development, and organogenesis.  in this study, we examine the endocytic recycling of integrin beta1, a process that has been suggested to play an important role during cell motility by mediating the redistribution of integrins to the migrating front.  our data demonstrate that α5 integrin turnover is dependent on fibronectin matrix assembly, where the absence of matrix-capable fibronectin in the extracellular space targets the internalized receptor for rapid degradation.  combined with functional data, the structure reveals a new mechanism of filamin-mediated retention of inactive integrin, suggesting a new framework for understanding regulation of integrin activation and adhesion.  further, we show that ubiquitination and degradation of internalized α5 integrin in the absence of fibronectin require the presence of two specific lysine residues in the α5 cytoplasmic tail.  these results suggest that beta1 integrin conformation can be regulated by conserved cytosolic interactions involving beta cytoplasmic domains.  here, we investigate the biological relevance of beta1 integrin endocytosis to fibronectin matrix turnover. ||| ",yes
Is the regulation of Vsr endonuclease independent of the growth phase of bacteria?,"the expression of many virulence-associated genes in streptococcus pyogenes is controlled in a growth phase-dependent manner.  infection of escherichia coli with bacteriophage t7 results in an inhibition of the host exonuclease v (recb, c dnase) activity.  while rnase j1 is the first bacterial exoribonuclease with 5'-to-3' processivity, rnase y is the founding member of a novel class of endoribonucleases.  the post-transcriptional regulator csra regulates multiple unrelated processes such as central carbon metabolism, motility, biofilm formation and bacterial virulence in different bacteria.  non-differentiating bacteria adapt to starvation induced growth arrest by a complex turn-on/turn-off pattern of protein synthesis.  alternative transcription factor sigma b of bacillus subtilis controls a stationary-phase regulon induced under growth conditions that do not favor sporulation.  srnas in bacteria can affect important processes, such as metabolism and virulence.  by contrast, gram-positive bacteria do not possess several important players of e. coli rna degradation, most notably the essential enzyme rnase e. recent research on the model gram-positive organism, bacillus subtilis, has identified the essential rnases j1 and y as crucial enzymes in rna degradation.  growth defect of the δacsr strain in acetate-minimal medium was restored by complementation.  vpsr, the master regulator of biofilm formation in vibrio cholerae, is an atypical ntrc1 type bebp lacking residues essential for σ54-rnap binding and rec domain phosphorylation.  studies of bacillus subtilis rnases that are involved in mrna degradation reveal a different pattern from that of escherichia coli.  the results provide further evidence that rgg contributes to growth phase-dependent gene regulation in strain nz131.  here, we show that the b. subtilis yvaj gene encodes a second 3'-to-5' exoribonuclease.  this study indicates that the vars/vara system plays a role in v. vulnificus metabolism via regulating acsr, which in turn controls acetate metabolism by activating the transcription of the acetyl-coa synthetase gene.  this contribution also discusses the diversity of the differentiation-like response to starvation in different bacteria and whether a general starvation induced programme exists.  the existence of another, as yet unknown, 3'-to-5' exoribonuclease in b. subtilis is suggested.  this review presents a model, based on recent published data, of rna degradation in b. subtilis.  subsequent bacterial adherence and motility assays showed that inactivation of csra in ehec o157:h7 resulted in a significant increase in bacterial adherence to host epithelial cells, with a concomitant loss of swimming motility on semi-solid agar plates.  degradation is initiated by rnase y-dependent endonucleolytic cleavage, followed by processive exoribonucleolysis of the generated fragments both in 3'-to-5' and in 5'-to-3' directions.  well-characterized examples of spatial regulation are less common in bacteria. ||| ",no
Is the toxin produced by Clostridium botulinum always deadly?,"in the last fifty years, clostridium botulinum has become notorious for its ability to produce the deadly botulinum neurotoxins.  botulism is a serious neuroparalytic disease caused by toxins of clostridium botulinum.  botulinum toxin is a neurotoxin produced by clostridium botulinum and some other relative species.  botulism is a deadly disease caused by ingestion of the preformed neurotoxin produced from the anaerobic spore-forming bacteria clostridium botulinum.  clostridium botulinum is the etiological agent of botulism.  botulism is a rare but serious paralytic illness caused by botulinum toxin, which is produced by the clostridium botulinum.  botulinum neurotoxins, causative agents of botulism in humans, are produced by clostridium botulinum, an anaerobic spore-former gram-positive bacillus.  botulinum toxin is produced under anaerobic conditions and is one of the most dangerous toxin in the world.  botulinum neurotoxins, causative agents of botulism in humans, are produced by clostridium botulinum, an anaerobic spore-former gram positive bacillus.  botulinum neurotoxins (bonts) produced by the spore-forming, gram-positive, anaerobic bacterium clostridium botulinum are the most toxic substances known and cause botulism, flaccid paralysis, or death.  the versatility of these botulinum toxins has made clostridium botulinum one of the most widely known bacterial pathogens in medical history.  botulinum neurotoxins (bont), produced by the anaerobic bacterium clostridium botulinum, cause severe neuroparalytic disease and are considered the most toxic biological agents known.  clostridium botulinum and clostridium tetani, respectively, produce potent toxins, botulinum neurotoxin (bont) and tetanus neurotoxin (tetx), which are responsible for severe diseases, botulism and tetanus.  botulism is a paralytic illness caused by the action of a neurotoxin elaborated by clostridium botulinum.  botulinum neurotoxin is the neuromuscular poison that is responsible for the fatal disease botulism.  clostridium botulinum is the aetiological agent of botulism, a disease marked by flaccid paralysis that can progress to asphyxiation and death.  botulinum neurotoxins (bonts), produced by spore-forming anaerobic clostridium botulinum, are the most toxic substances known.  unfortunately, in the wrong hands, botulinum neurotoxin is also a deadly biological ""weapon.  botulism is a disease characterized by neuromuscular paralysis and is produced from botulinum neurotoxins (bonts) found within the gram positive bacterium clostridium botulinum.  the toxic products of the anaerobic bacteria clostridium botulinum, clostridium butyricum, clostridium barati and clostridium tetani are the causative agents of botulism and tetanus. ||| ",no
Is the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle affected in inflammation?,"alterations of the tca cycle play a pivotal role in oncogenesis and inflammation.  metabolites involved in the tricarboxylic acid (tca) cycle have previously been proposed as cardiovascular biomarkers.  the hepatic tricarboxylic acid (tca) cycle is central to integrating macronutrient metabolism and is closely coupled to cellular respiration, free radical generation, and inflammation.  the tricarboxylic acid (tca) cycle performs an essential role in the regulation of energy and metabolism, and deficiencies in this pathway are commonly correlated with various diseases.  the tricarboxylic acid (tca) cycle is one of the most important pathways of energy metabolism, and the profiles of its components are influenced by factors such as diseases and diets.  here, the ""non-metabolic"" signaling functions of tca cycle intermediates in the macrophage under inflammatory stimulation and the role of intermediates in the progression of atherosclerosis were discussed.  the tricarboxylic acid (tca) cycle is one of the most important metabolic pathway for cellular respiration in aerobic organisms.  the tricarboxylic acid (tca) cycle is essential for oxidative energy production.  the tricarboxylic acid (tca) cycle is the main source of cellular energy and participates in many metabolic pathways in cells.  the tricarboxylic acid (tca) cycle is a central part of carbon and energy metabolism, also connecting to glycolysis, amino acid, and lipid metabolism.  tricarboxylic acid (tca) cycle deregulation may predispose to cardiovascular diseases, but the role of tca cycle-related metabolites in the development of atrial fibrillation (af) and heart failure (hf) remains unexplored.  the tricarboxylic acid (tca) cycle (or citric acid cycle) is responsible for the complete oxidation of acetyl-coa and formation of intermediates required for atp production and other anabolic pathways, such as amino acid synthesis.  significance: the tricarboxylic acid (tca) cycle is a housekeeping metabolic pathway essential for generation of energy and biosynthetic intermediates.  similarly, the tca cycle appeared as an actionable pathway in immunopathologies.  these findings underscore the potential role of the tca cycle in the pathogenesis of cardiac outcomes.  similarly, the observation that tca cycle-derived metabolites have multiple signaling roles in immune cells supports the idea of this pathway as a metabolic rheostat of immune responses.  carboxylic acids have various biological activities and play critical roles in cellular metabolic pathways such as the tricarboxylic acid (tca) cycle.  the tricarboxylic acid (tca) cycle is the center of energy metabolism in eukaryotic cells and dynamically adjusted according to energy needs of cells.  metabolites in the tricarboxylic acid (tca) cycle are not only involved in energy metabolism but also play important roles in non-energy production activities.  this review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the relationship between each tca cycle-related enzyme and human diseases. ||| ",yes
Is the yeast Μac1 transcription factor induced upon copper deficiency?,"yeast transcription factor ace1 functions as a sensor for copper and an inducer for the transcription of cup1.  transcription of the saccharomyces cerevisiae metallothionein gene cup1 is induced in response to high environmental levels of copper.  cup2 is a copper-dependent transcriptional activator of the yeast cup1 metallothionein gene.  in saccharomyces cerevisiae, copper ions regulate gene expression through the two transcriptional activators, ace1 and mac1.  copper deprivation of saccharomyces cerevisiae induces transcription of the fre1 and ctr1 genes.  the results suggest that the expression of the cu-mt gene is, in part, responsible for mediating copper resistance in yeast.  dna microarray hybridization experiments revealed a limited set of yeast genes differentially expressed under growth conditions of excess copper or copper deficiency.  the yeast mac1 protein is a copper-sensing transcription factor that is essential for both the activation and inactivation of genes required for high affinity copper ion transport.  these results demonstrate that nutritional and toxic copper concentrations elicit distinct fates for the mac1 copper-sensing transcription factor and establish a new mechanism by which trace metals regulate gene expression.  yeast metallothionein, encoded by the cup1 gene, and its copper-dependent transcriptional activator ace1 play a key role in mediating copper resistance in saccharomyces cerevisiae.  ace1 and mac1 undergo reciprocal copper metalloregulation in yeast cells.  yeast one-hybrid analysis demonstrates that the copper-dependent transcriptional activity in mac1p resides primarily in a cysteine-rich element encompassing residues 264-279.  mac1p-dependent transcriptional activation is negatively regulated by copper.  here we demonstrate that in response to low copper ion concentrations mac1 protein is rendered inactive for copper transporter gene transcription.  the mac1 protein in saccharomyces cerevisiae is essential for the expression of yeast high affinity copper uptake.  using an ethyl methanesulfonate mutant of a yeast strain in which cup1 and ace1 were deleted, we isolated a gene, designated cup9, which permits yeast cells to grow at high concentrations of environmental copper, most notably when lactate is the sole carbon source.  the induction of saccharomyces cerevisiae metallothionein gene transcription by cu and ag is mediated by the ace1 transcription factor.  transformation of a copper-sensitive (cus) yeast strain by one of these clones confers copper resistance in yeast.  mac1 is functional as a transcriptional activator in copper-deficient cells, whereas ace1 is a transcriptional activator in copper-replete cells.  the induction of a copper-binding metallothionein (cu-mt) was studied in yeast, saccharomyces cerevisiae, and a relationship between copper resistance and intracellular levels of cu-mt in these eukaryotes was established. ||| ",yes
Is there a crystal structure of the full-length of the flaviviridae NS5(Methyltransferase - RNA depended RNA Polymerase) ?,"flavivirus nonstructural protein 5 (ns5) contains an n-terminal methyltransferase (mtase) domain and a c-terminal polymerase (rna-dependent rna polymerase ) domain fused through a 9-amino-acid linker.  the rna-dependent rna polymerase (rdrp) from the flavivirus genus is naturally fused to a methyltransferase (mtase), and the full-length protein is named nonstructural protein 5 (ns5).  flavivirus nonstructural protein 5 (ns5) consists of methyltransferase (mtase) and rna-dependent rna polymerase (rdrp) domains, which catalyze 5'-rna capping/methylation and rna synthesis, respectively, during viral genome replication.  the flavivirus ns5 is very unique in having a methyltransferase (mtase) placed on the immediate n terminus of its rna-dependent rna polymerase (rdrp).  the flavivirus ns5 protein contains an n-terminal methyl-transferase (mtase) connected through a flexible linker with a c-terminal rna-dependent rna-polymerase (rdrp) domain, that work cooperatively to replicate and methylate the viral genome.  the flavivirus ns5 harbors both a methyltransferase (mtase) and an rna-dependent rna polymerase (rdrp).  being a natural fusion of a methyltransferase (mtase) and an rna-dependent rna polymerase (rdrp), ns5 is the most conserved flavivirus protein and an important antiviral target.  sequence motifs within the non-structural protein ns5 or ns5b of the members of the family flaviviridae suggest that this protein is the rna-dependent rna polymerase.  the flavivirus ns5 is a natural fusion of a methyltransferase (mtase) and an rna-dependent rna polymerase (rdrp).  in flavivirus ns5 crystal structures, the start of the linker forms a 310 helix when ns5 adopts a compact conformation, but becomes disordered or extended in open conformations.  reported here is the three-dimensional structure of hcv ns5b polymerase, with the highlight on its c-terminal folding, determined by x-ray crystallography at 2.1-a resolution.  in the flavivirus genus, the non-structural protein ns5 plays a central role in rna viral replication and constitutes a major target for drug discovery.  flavivirus nonstructural protein 5 (ns5) possesses enzymatic activities required for capping and synthesis of the viral rna genome and is essential for virus replication.  we report the crystal structure of dengue virus full-length ns5, where eight molecules of ns5 are arranged as four independent dimers in the crystallographic asymmetric unit.  ns5 is a nonstructural protein essential for flavivirus rna replication with dual mtase and rdrp enzyme activities and thus constitutes a major drug target.  although the crystal structure of flavivirus ns5 is known, no data about the quaternary organization of the functional enzyme are available.  the flavivirus nonstructural protein 5 (ns5) is a large protein that is structurally conserved among members of the genus, making it an attractive target for antiviral drug development.  flavivirus ns5 is the most conserved protein amongst the flavivirus proteins and is an essential enzyme for viral mrna capping and replication.  flavivirus protein ns5 harbors the rna-dependent rna polymerase (rdrp) activity.  the dengue virus (denv) non-structural protein 5 (ns5) comprises an n-terminal methyltransferase and a c-terminal rna-dependent rna polymerase (rdrp) domain. ||| ",yes
Is there a difference in the rate between gene fusion and gene fission?,"during the course of evolution genes undergo both fusion and fission by which orfs are joined or separated.  gene fission and fusion, the processes by which a single gene is split into two separate genes and two adjacent genes are fused into a single gene, respectively, are among the primary processes that generate new genes.  we have also examined the evolution of the gene fusion events identified, to determine whether they can be attributed to fusion or fission, by looking at the conservation of the fused genes and of the individual component genes across the major eukaryotic and prokaryotic lineages.  fusion genes, also known as ""chimeras"", are formed by the breakage and re-joining of two different chromosomes.  gene fusion is an important evolutionary process.  recent comparative genome analysis shows several cases of fusion/fission across distant phylogeny.  on many occasions, the evolutionary scenario also involves one or more secondary fissions of the fusion gene.  fusion genes result from genomic rearrangements, such as deletions, amplifications and translocations.  these data suggest that gene fission plays an important and hitherto underestimated role in gene evolution.  the occurrence of gene fusions suggests that the two original genes that participated in the fusion are functionally linked, i.e.  the process of gene fusion involves the formation of a single chimeric gene from multiple complete or partial gene sequences.  gene fusions have been studied extensively, as frequent drivers of tumorigenesis as well as potential therapeutic targets.  gene fusion is recognized as an important mechanism by which genes and their protein products can evolve new functions.  we name the products of such fusion events cross-strand chimeric rna (cscrna).  we find relatively limited occurrence of gene fusions/fissions within the protist lineages examined.  our results point to two trypanosome-specific gene fissions, which have recently been experimentally confirmed, one fusion involving proteins involved in the same metabolic pathway, as well as two novel putative functional links between fusion-linked protein pairs.  the evolutionary history of gene fusions was studied by phylogenetic analysis of the domains in the fused proteins and the orthologous domains that form stand-alone proteins.  the grouping into families will help distinguish sequencing or prediction errors from real biological fusions, and it will yield additional insight into the function and history of fused genes.  with the application of defined constraints, certain properties of the detected genes are evaluated to predict whether they may be fused.  gene fusions can be used as tools for functional prediction and also as evolutionary markers. ||| ",yes
Is there a disease or condition called Exploding Head Syndrome?,"exploding head syndrome is characterized by the perception of abrupt, loud noises when going to sleep or waking up.  exploding head syndrome (ehs) is a benign sensory parasomnia characterized by the perception of loud noises or a sense of explosion in the head.  exploding head syndrome is characterized by the perception of loud noises during sleep-wake or wake-sleep transitions.  exploding head syndrome (ehs) is characterized by attacks of a sudden noise or explosive feeling experienced in the head occurring during the transition from wake to sleep or from sleep to wake.  background exploding head syndrome (ehs) is characterized by loud noises or a sense of explosion in the head during sleep transitions.  contrary to some earlier theorizing, exploding head syndrome was found to be a relatively common experience in younger individuals.  exploding head syndrome episodes were accompanied by clinically significant levels of fear, and a minority (2.80%) experienced it to such a degree that it was associated with clinically significant distress and/or impairment.  after first discussing the history, prevalence, and associated features, the available polysomnography data and five main etiological theories for exploding head syndrome are summarized.  at present there are little systematic data on exploding head syndrome, and prevalence rates are unknown.  in order to test these hypotheses, 211 undergraduate students were assessed for both exploding head syndrome and isolated sleep paralysis using semi-structured diagnostic interviews: 18.00% of the sample experienced lifetime exploding head syndrome, this reduced to 16.60% for recurrent cases.  in spite of the fact that its characteristic symptomatology was first described approximately 150 y ago, exploding head syndrome has received relatively little empirical and clinical attention.  the term post-head-trauma syndrome is used to denote a group of symptoms following head trauma.  background headache attributed to head injury is claimed to be among the most common secondary headache disorders, yet available epidemiological evidence is scarce.  we present six new cases extending the clinical experience with the syndrome.  next, the various methods used to assess and treat exploding head syndrome are discussed, as well as the limited outcome data.  it would seem that these cases can be related to some degree of cerebral venous outflow obstruction.  headache can be a symptom of vast pathologies, and common secondary headache including head or neck trauma, cranial or cervical vascular disorder, non-vascular intracranial disorders headache related to a substance or its withdrawals, infection, disorders of homeostasis, disorders of cranium or facial mouth or cranial disorders, and headache attributable to psychiatric.  although episodes by themselves are relatively harmless, it is a frightening phenomenon that may result in clinical consequences.  headache can also be the sole or predominant clinical manifestation of epileptic seizures, although this is a relatively rare condition.  recently, the term ictal epileptic headache has been proposed in cases in which headache is the sole ictal epileptic manifestation diagnosis requires the simultaneous onset of headache with eeg-demonstrated ictal discharges. ||| ",yes
Is there a genome-wide technique for the detection of R-loop formation?,"current models suggest that uncontrolled r-loops are a hazard to genome integrity, therefore, identifying proteins that are involved in recognising and signalling r-loop structures are of key importance.  here, we describe a new, highly sensitive, and antibody-independent method, mapr, to profile native r-loops genome wide.  here, we provide a detailed protocol for a newly developed strategy, named r-chip, for robust capture of r-loops genome-wide.  although recent studies have revealed the genome-wide distribution of r-loops, our understanding of r-loop formation is still limited.  here, we conducted a genome-wide identification of r-loops and identified more than 700,000 r-loop peaks in the maize (zea mays) genome.  understanding the parameters dictating r-loop formation in vivo has been hampered by the limited quantitative and spatial resolution of current genomic strategies for mapping r loops.  devising methods to identify the precise genomic locations of r-loops is critical to understand how these structures regulate numerous cellular processes, including replication, termination, and chromosome segregation, and how their unscheduled formation results in disease.  here, using our recently developed genome-wide r-loop profiling method, we generated a comprehensive atlas quantifying the r-loop patterns of arabidopsis (arabidopsis thaliana) in 53 samples during development and during responses to environmental stimuli.  we review the current knowledge of the mechanisms controlling r loops and their putative relationship with disease.  understanding the genomic distribution and function of r-loops is an important goal, since r-loops have been implicated in a number of adaptive and maladaptive processes under physiological and pathological conditions.  here, we analyse published dna:rna-hybrid sequencing to elucidate the features that determine dsb-induced r-loop formation.  recently, evidence has emerged that r loops occur more often in the genome and have greater physiological relevance, including roles in transcription and chromatin structure, than was previously predicted.  our findings thus provide a direct demonstration that r-loop formation impairs dna replication and that this is responsible for the deleterious effects of r loops on genome stability from bacteria to humans.  thus, the hybrid map generated by s1-drip-seq led to the identification of the first global genomic features causal for r-loop formation in yeast.  to enable precision analysis of r-loops in vivo, we develop an rnase-h-based approach; this reveals predominant r-loop formation near gene promoters with strong g/c skew and propensity to form g-quadruplex in non-template dna, corroborating with all biochemically established properties of r-loops.  r-loop, a three-stranded rna/dna structure, has been linked to induced genome instability and regulated gene expression.  r-loops are a common chromatin feature with essential functions in multiple cellular processes and diseases.  r-loop represents a prevalent and specialized chromatin structure critically involved in a wide range of biological processes.  drip (dna:rna immunoprecipitation)-seq techniques are widely used to map r-loops genome-wide providing insights into r-loop biology.  more importantly, we then show that r-loop formation causes dna replication fork stalling, and that this in fact underlies the effects of r loops on genomic stability. ||| ",yes
Is there a link between nuclear position and DNA repair pathway choice?,"our results are consistent with a model in which nuclear position dictates the choice of dna repair pathway, thus revealing a new level of regulation in dsb repair controlled by spatial organization of dna within the nucleus.  nuclear organization has emerged as a key parameter in the formation of chromosomal translocations, yet little is known as to whether dna repair can efficiently occur throughout the nucleus and whether it is affected by the location of the lesion.  to test this hypothesis, we have examined the nuclear distribution of sites of dna repair induced by oxidation or uv-c. we do not detect more damage (repair) at the nuclear periphery than in the nuclear interior.  the emerging theme is that relocation to the npc regulates recombination to influence repair pathway choice and provide a rescue mechanism for lesions or dna structures that are resistant to repair.  in this study we addressed the questions as to whether repair is confined to the nuclear matrix compartment, analogous to replication and transcription and how repair events are distributed in dna loops associated with the nuclear matrix.  despite this ordered spatial genome organization, damaged dna exhibits increased random mobility within nuclear space.  pulse labelling of ultraviolet (254 nm) irradiated confluent human fibroblasts revealed that repair was preferentially located in nuclear matrix associated dna in cells exposed to 5 j/m2.  this increased random movement is thought to promote dna repair by facilitating homology search, allowing targeting to repair-conducive nuclear domains, or releasing damage from repair-repressive locations.  of these two sites, the nuclear pore appears to be crucial for dna repair of persistent double-strand breaks, eroded telomeres and sites of fork collapse at expanded cag repeats.  nuclear architecture and the chromatin state affect most-if not all- dna-dependent transactions, including the ability of cells to sense dna lesions and restore damaged dna back to its native form.  the results of pulse-chase experiments exclude the possibility of transient binding of repair sites to the matrix and favour the model of preferential repair of dna sequences permanently associated with the nuclear matrix.  in this study the role of nuclear architecture in nucleotide excision repair (ner) was investigated by gentle dismantling of the cell and probing the capability of chromatin to carry out repair in vitro.  recent studies focusing on the relationship between telomeres, dna repair processes, and nuclear organization have revealed that the disruption of motor proteins or microtubules, which typically mediate the directed motion of cargo, disrupts the random mobility of damaged dna.  nuclear organization has an important role in determining genome function; however, it is not clear how spatiotemporal organization of the genome relates to functionality.  over the last decade, studies have revealed that several types of persistent dna lesions relocate to either the nuclear pore complex (npc) or nuclear envelope (ne).  early screens in yeast for mutations exhibiting sensitivity to dna damage identified nuclear pore components, but their role in dna repair was not well understood.  we suggest that features of the chromatin structure, or base composition, of sequences in the nuclear centre make them more susceptible to damage.  it has been shown that the positioning of a majority of nucleosomes is primarily controlled by factors other than the intrinsic preference of the dna sequence.  which pathway is used depends on the balance between the tumor suppressors 53bp1 and brca1 and on the availability of an undamaged template dna for homology-directed repair.  rad6, an e2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, is a key node for determining different dna damage repair pathways, controlling both the error-prone and the error-free dna damage repair pathways through differential regulation of the ubiquitination of the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (pcna) protein. ||| ",yes
Is there a mouse model for Fanconi anemia?,"in an effort to develop a fanconi anemia murine model to study bone marrow failure, we found that fancd2(-/-) mice have readily measurable hematopoietic defects.  fanconi anemia (fa) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by progressive bone marrow failure (bmf) during childhood, aside from numerous congenital abnormalities.  fanconi anemia (fa) is a genetic syndrome predisposing to hematopoietic failure.  fanconi anemia (fa) is a genetic disorder characterized by hypersensitivity to dna damage, bone marrow failure, congenital defects, and cancer.  fancd2(-/-) mice exhibit many features of human fanconi anemia including cellular dna repair defects.  fanconi anemia (fa) is a complex genetic disorder characterized by progressive bone marrow (bm) aplasia, chromosomal instability, and acquisition of malignancies, particularly myeloid leukemia.  fanconi anemia (fa) is an inherited disorder of genomic instability associated with high risk of myelodysplasia and acute myeloid leukemia (aml).  the mitomycin c-treated fancc(-/-) mouse provides a valuable model to address long-term efficacy of such treatment.  the above mal model shows urine biochemistry changes similar to those reported in patients suffering from fanconi syndrome.  progressive bone marrow failure is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in human fanconi anemia patients.  we conclude that fancd2(-/-) mice have readily quantifiable hematopoietic defects, and that this model is well suited for pharmacologic screening studies.  despite the cloning of four disease-associated genes for fanconi anemia (fa), the molecular pathogenesis of fa remains largely unknown.  fanconi anaemia (fa) is a rare disease characterized by chromosome instability and cancer susceptibility.  we used a murine model containing a disruption of the murine homologue (fac) of fanconi anemia group c (fac) to evaluate the role of fac in the pathogenesis of bone marrow (bm) failure.  in contrast to observations made in other fanconi anemia (fa) mouse models, low numbers of hematopoietic colony-forming cells (cfcs) were noted in brca2(delta27/delta27) mice, either young or adult.  fa mouse models have been generated; however, they do not fully mimic the hematopoietic phenotype.  however, fancd2 mutant mice also displayed phenotypes not observed in other mice with disruptions of proximal fa genes.  with the exception of fancd2, none of the fanconi anaemia genes are conserved in evolution, limiting the study of the fanconi anaemia pathway in genetically tractable models.  the following cell types were used: mouse embryonic fibroblast cell lines fanca(-/-), fancc(-/-), fanca(-/-)c(-/-), fancd2(-/-) and their parental cells, the chinese hamster cell lines fancd1 mutant (mt), fancgmt, their revertant cells, and the corresponding wild-type (wt) cells.  transient treatment with cytokines appears to improve hematopoietic function in fanconi anemia; however, the effectiveness or adverse effect of long-term treatment is not known. ||| ",yes
Is there a package in R/bioconductor for classification of alternative splicing?,"recent software improvements in full-length transcript deconvolution prompted us to develop splicer, an r package for classification of alternative splicing and prediction of coding potential.  a plethora of tools exist for rna-seq data analysis with a focus on alternative splicing (as).  computational tools analyzing rna-sequencing data have boosted alternative splicing research by identifying and assessing differentially spliced genes.  splicer is implemented as an r package and is freely available from the bioconductor repository ( http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/2.13/bioc/html/splicer.html).  the detection of alternative splicing using microarray technology involves multiple computational steps: normalisation, filtering, detection and visualisation.  here, we present bandits, a r/bioconductor package to perform differential splicing, at both gene and transcript level, based on rna-seq data.  the r package asimulator simulates gold standard rna-seq datasets with fine-grained control over the distribution of as events, which allow for evaluating alternative splicing tools, e.g.  alternative splicing is a biological process during gene expression that allows a single gene to code for multiple proteins.  splicer is an easy-to-use tool that extends the usability of rna-seq and assembly technologies by allowing greater depth of annotation of rna-seq data.  to explore any given specified genomic region, corresponding to an alternative splicing event, valerie generates an ensemble of informative plots to visualise cell-to-cell heterogeneity of alternative splicing profiles across single cells and performs statistical tests to compare percent spliced-in (psi) values across the user-defined groups of cells.  here, we present assembling splice junctions analysis (asja), a software package that identifies and characterizes all splice junctions from high-throughput rna sequencing (rna-seq) data.  we present valerie (visualising alternative splicing events from single-cell ribonucleic acid-sequencing experiments), an r package for visualising alternative splicing events at single-cell resolution.  prior to rna-seq analyses, users should consider job time, amount of replicates and splice event type of interest to determine the optimal alternative splicing tool.  lastly, splicer predicts the coding potential, as well as the potential nonsense mediated decay (nmd) sensitivity of each transcript.  rna splicing may generate different kinds of splice junctions, such as linear, back-splice and fusion junctions.  here we present an r package, rseqnp, which implements a non-parametric approach to test for differential expression and splicing from rna-seq data.  however, splicing patterns can be altered in some conditions or diseases.  splicer uses the full-length transcript output from rna-seq assemblers to detect single or multiple exon skipping, alternative donor and acceptor sites, intron retention, alternative first or last exon usage, and mutually exclusive exon events.  this report compares the computational performance (cpu utilization and ram usage) of three event-level splicing tools; rmats, miso, and suppa2.  we had previously developed an r/bioconductor package (called tcc) for this purpose. ||| ",yes
Is there a pharmacogenetic test for trastuzumab?,"the pharmacogenetics of either individual patients or tumors has been used to aid the progress of personalized medicine to generate antitumor drugs (eg, trastuzamab and erlotinib) that are active against tumors expressing particular growth factor receptors.  accurate testing is crucial for appropriate identification of patients for trastuzumab therapy.  our intention was to detect genes and single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) affecting trastuzumab efficiency in cell culture.  pharmacogenetic testing can affect choice of therapy, even in the absence of definitive data on clinical impact.  pharmacogenetic testing holds major promise in allowing physicians to tailor therapy to patients based on genotype.  several tests of varying accuracy and cost are available to identify candidates for trastuzumab.  administration of first-in-class anti-egfr monoclonal antibody cetuximab is contingent upon extensive pharmacogenomic testing.  outside the field of cancer therapeutics, pharmacogenetic tests have been introduced to detect patient genotypes with the aim of individualizing existing treatments.  the aim of this study was to evaluate whether trastuzumab modifies the pharmacokinetics of epirubicin and its metabolites.  cyp2d6 testing among tamoxifen users offers a potential test case of the use of pharmacogenetic testing in the clinic.  to identify genetic variants determining the risk of trastuzumab-induced cardiotoxicity, we carried out whole exome sequencing of germline dna samples from 9 patients with trastuzumab-induced cardiotoxicity, and conducted a case-control association study of 2258 genetic variants between 9 cases (with trastuzumab-induced cardiotoxicity) and general japanese population controls registered in the human genetic variation database (hgvd).  this paper presents an overview of her2 testing for trastuzumab (herceptin) treatment in breast cancer cases.  we further searched for snps in the untreated cell lines which could contribute to trastuzumab resistance.  pharmacogenetic testing evaluates patient dna to determine if a drug is expected to have a normal clinical effect, heightened effect, or no effect at all on the patient.  although an immense effort has been made to develop a novel biomarker for response to trastuzumab, no reliable biomarkers are available to guide management, expect for her2.  a combined result of the screening and the replication studies suggested an association of a locus on chromosome 6q12 with trastuzumab-induced cardiotoxicity (rs139944387 in eys, combined pmin = .00056, or = 13.73).  future pharmaceutical trials should include pharmacogenetic research to test appropriate candidate genes in a prospective manner and correlate genetic associations with trial outcomes and relevant functional data.  these results contribute to a better understanding of trastuzumab action and resistance mechanisms.  serum samples were collected from patients with her2-positive breast cancer who were treated with trastuzumab.  however, there is little data on the impact of pharmacogenetic test results on patient and clinician choice of therapy. ||| ",yes
Is there a phylogenetic analysis for HIV?,"phylogenetics is an important tool for hiv research, and offers opportunities to understand critical aspects of the hiv epidemic.  the purpose of this review is to highlight the current utilities and limitations of phylogenetics in hiv epidemiological research from sample collection through to data analysis.  to discuss the recent hiv phylogenetic analyses examining hiv transmission patterns among and within risk groups.  phylogenetics is frequently used for studies of population-based hiv transmission.  phylogenetic methods are being increasingly used to help understand the transmission dynamics of measurably evolving viruses, including hiv.  the growth of human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) sequence databases resulting from drug resistance testing has motivated efforts using phylogenetic methods to assess how hiv spreads1-4.  these results highlight the importance of comparative hiv evolutionary studies in immunologically different populations worldwide.  viral phylogenetic methods contribute to understanding how hiv spreads in populations, and thereby help guide the design of prevention interventions.  here, we show that viral phylogenetic tools can be adapted and used to estimate epidemiological quantities of central importance to hiv-1 prevention in sub-saharan africa.  knowledge of the phylogenetic history of the human immunodeficiency viruses (hiv-1 and hiv-2) is important for our understanding of the epidemiology of aids, the disease caused by these viruses.  phylogenetic analysis - the study of the genetic relatedness between hiv strains - has recently been used in criminal prosecutions as evidence of responsibility for hiv transmission.  this complex, known hiv-1 transmission history was compared with reconstructed molecular trees, which were calculated from the dna sequences by several commonly used phylogenetic inference methods .  phylogenetic analyses are increasingly used in attempts to clarify transmission patterns of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1), but there is a continuing discussion about their validity because convergent evolution and transmission of minor hiv variants may obscure epidemiological patterns.  thus, our results establish how to interpret phylogenetic trees based on hiv sequences when tracking who-infected-whom, when and how genetic information can be used for improved tracking of hiv spread.  the accuracy of the phylogenetic methods justifies their use in hiv-1 research and argues against convergent evolution and selective transmission of certain virus variants.  here, we address this issue by investigating phylogenetic patterns from 272 previously identified hiv transmission chains with 955 transmission pairs representing diverse geography, risk groups, subtypes, and genomic regions.  phylogenetic analysis has been widely used to test the a priori hypothesis of epidemiological clustering in suspected transmission chains of hiv-1.  the phylogenetic relationship between the hiv populations of epidemiologically linked hosts can be classified into six types of trees, based on cladistic relationships and whether the reconstruction is consistent with the true transmission history or not.  we show that the resulting phylogeny inferred from real hiv genetic sequences indeed reveals distinct patterns associated with direct transmission contra transmissions from a common source.  to direct the use of phylogenetic tools to where the impact of hiv-1 is greatest, the phylogenetics and networks for generalized hiv epidemics in africa (pangea-hiv) consortium generates full-genome viral sequences from across sub-saharan africa. ||| ",yes
Is there a relation between ANP and transcapillary albumin escape?,"transcapillary escape rate of intravascular albumin when corrected for concurrent plasma volume changes showed a significantly greater escape during anp infusion than during saline control (p < 0.05).  the transvascular escape rate (ter) of labeled albumin is reported to increase in essential hypertension.  we studied the effect of low dose anp (2.5 pmol/kg.min) or equal volume of saline control when infused over 90 min, on plasma volume, transcapillary escape rate of intravascular albumin, and the rate of reentry of albumin to the vascular space in eight normal subjects.  this study was aimed at determining the specific organs in which anf increases the escape of albumin.  this study was undertaken to determine whether atrial natriuretic peptide (anp) may play a role in the escape phenomenon.  therefore, the rise in albuminuria during anp infusion most likely reflects alterations in glomerular permeability.  anf increased the rate at which 125i-albumin escaped from the overall circulation at infusion rates of 0.1 and 0.5 micrograms.min-1.kg-1.  at an anf infusion rate of 0.1 micrograms.min-1.kg-1, the albumin escape rate increased in the gastrointestinal tract, skeletal muscle, heart, and lungs.  in summary, low dose anp infusion in healthy subjects caused a shift of plasma water and electrolytes from the circulation, with albumin escape as a secondary phenomenon.  the free form of anp was inversely correlated with the daily urinary sodium excretion (r = -0.71, p less than 0.001) and plasma albumin (r = -0.83, p less than 0.001), and positively correlated with the daily urinary protein excretion (r = -0.85, p less than 0.001) in both control and nephrotic groups.  an increase in albumin excretion has traditionally been considered to reflect a 'glomerular' leak of protein; however, it is now recognized that significant tubular reabsorption of albumin occurs under physiological conditions that may be modified by genetic determinants, systemic disease and drug therapies.  after infusion of anp dissolved in haemaccel urinary beta2-m excretion increased from 0.05 +/- 0.03 microg min(-1) to 27 +/- 10 microg min(-1) and urinary albumin excretion increased from 4.5 +/- 1.1 microg min(-1) to 9.7 +/- 6.3 microg min(-1) (p<0.05).  the currently defined mechanisms underpinning the tubular reabsorption of albumin, how these are modified by pathology and pharmacology, and the clinical implications are the subject of this review.  atrial natriuretic factor (anf) causes plasma fluid to shift out of the circulation and enhances the escape of radiolabeled albumin.  during anp + saline infusion, urinary beta2-m excretion did not change, whereas the urinary albumin excretion increased from 5.3 +/- 1.5 microg min(-1) to 7.9 +/- 2.4 microg min(-1) (p<0.05).  this is the second of two studies of the influence of perfusate albumin composition on ap alterations in capillary lp.  in the first series of studies, infusion of anp resulted in a significant natriuresis, diuresis, and increase in inulin clearance and in a slight fall in systemic arterial pressure, as compared to vehicle infusion.  there is also mounting evidence for a transcytotic pathway for retrieval of albumin from the tubular filtrate.  in conclusion, 1) anp infusion induced a sustained natriuresis and transient diuresis; 2) there were no changes in the subcellular localization of aqp2 and enac subunits after 10 min of anp infusion; and 3) there was a marked increase in apical targeting of aqp2, p-aqp2, and alpha- and gamma-enac after 90 min of anp infusion.  we conclude that small hydrophilic albumin-associated substances antagonize ap- and snp-induced elevations of exchange microvessel hydraulic conductance without interfering with albumin's role in the maintenance of normal exchange vessel permeability. ||| ",yes
Is there a relationship between B cells and Multiple Sclerosis?,"accumulating evidence supports a major role of b cells in multiple sclerosis (ms) pathogenesis.  increasing evidence suggests that b cells contribute both to the regulation of normal autoimmunity and to the pathogenesis of immune mediated diseases, including multiple sclerosis (ms).  b cells are one of the key players in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis (ms).  increasing evidence indicates the involvement of b cells in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis (ms), but their precise roles are unclear.  b cells play a central role in multiple sclerosis (ms) pathology.  there is ongoing debate on how b cells contribute to the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis (ms).  the role of b cells in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis (ms), an autoimmune neurodegenerative disease, is becoming eminent in recent years, but the specific contribution of the distinct b cell subsets remains to be elucidated.  b lymphocytes are thought to play a relevant role in multiple sclerosis (ms) pathology.  these results suggest that b cells play a role in ms independent from antibody production and possibly related to their role in antigen presentation to t cells or to their chemokine/cytokine production.  b lymphocytes contribute to the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis (ms) by secreting antibodies and producing cytokines.  b cells are key contributors to chronic autoimmune pathology in multiple sclerosis (ms).  b cells are important pathogenic players in multiple sclerosis (ms), but their exact role is not known.  the critical question is how b cells contribute to ms.  recent reports advocate greater involvement of b cells and immunoglobulins in the initiation and propagation of ms lesions at different stages of their ontogeny.  the role of b cells in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis (ms) is incompletely understood.  molecular analyses of b cell populations in ms patients have revealed significant overlaps between peripheral lymphoid and clonally expanded central nervous system (cns) b cell populations, indicating that b cell trafficking may play a critical role in driving ms exacerbations.  b lymphocytes participate to the pathogenesis of ms via the secretion of functionally-diverse cytokines that might play a role in determining disease phenotypes.  the contribution of b cells and their products to the pathogenesis of ms has long been debated.  in this paper, we discuss both the deleterious and the beneficial roles of b cells and immunoglobulins in ms lesions.  it is debated whether multiple sclerosis (ms) might result from an immunopathological response toward an active epstein-barr virus (ebv) infection brought into the central nervous system (cns) by immigrating b cells. ||| ",yes
Is there a relationship between junctin and ryanodine receptors?,"junctin is one of the components of the ryanodine receptor ca release channel complex in sarcoplasmic reticulum.  junctin is a 26 kda membrane protein that binds to calsequestrin, triadin, and ryanodine receptors (ryrs) within the junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum of calcium release units.  junctin, a 26 kda intra-sarcoplasmic reticulum (sr) protein, forms a quaternary complex with triadin, calsequestrin and the ryanodine receptor (ryr) at the junctional sr membrane.  junctin is a 26-kda integral membrane protein, colocalized with the ryanodine receptor (ryr) and calsequestrin at the junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum (sr) membrane in cardiac and skeletal muscles.  junctin is a major transmembrane protein in cardiac junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum, which forms a quaternary complex with the ryanodine receptor (ca(2+) release channel), triadin, and calsequestrin.  in cardiac muscle, junctin forms a quaternary protein complex with the ryanodine receptor (ryr), calsequestrin, and triadin 1 at the luminal face of the junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum (jsr).  junctophilin-2 (jph2) is a cardiac specific member of the junctophilins, a newly characterized family of junctional membrane complex proteins important in physically approximating the plasmalemmal l-type calcium channel and the sarcoplasmic reticulum ryanodine receptor for calcium-induced calcium release.  by binding directly the ryr and calsequestrin, junctin may mediate the ca(2+)-dependent regulatory interactions between both proteins.  jph2 is believed to have an important role in sarcoplasmic reticulum (sr) ca(2+) handling and modulation of ryanodine receptor ca(2+) channels (ryr2).  overexpression of junctin led to down-regulation of triadin and ryr but to up-regulation of dihydropyridine receptor.  thus, junctin produces complex effects on ca(2+) sparks, transients, and leak, but the luminal -dependent dual response of junctin-devoid ryrs demonstrates that junctin normally acts as an activator of ryr channels at low luminal , and as an inhibitor at high luminal .  the levels of two other junctional sr-proteins, the ryanodine receptor and triadin, were reduced by 32% and 23%, respectively.  because the crossover occurs at a (sr) that is close to that present in resting cells, it is possible that the activator-inhibitor role of junctin may be exerted under periods of prevalent parasympathetic and sympathetic activity, respectively.  single channel recordings of ryrs from wt and jcn-ko cardiac sr indicate that the absence of junctin produces a dual effect on the normally linear response of ryrs to luminal : at low luminal  (<1 mmol l(-1)), junctin-devoid ryr channels are less responsive to luminal ; conversely, high luminal  turns them hypersensitive to this form of channel modulation.  we conclude that the increase in junctin expression affects the packing of calsequestrin in the junctional sr and facilitates the association of sr and t tubules.  these findings suggest that junctin plays a prominent role in cardiomyocyte ca-cycling and contractility.  the physiological role for junctin in the luminal regulation of ryr ca(2+) release remains unresolved, but it appears to be essential for proper cardiac function since ablation of junctin results in increased ventricular automaticity.  this study sought to study the role of junctophilin-2 (jph2) in atrial fibrillation (af).  junctin ablation appears to affect how ryrs 'sense' sr ca(2+) load, resulting in decreased diastolic sr ca(2+) leak despite an elevated (sr).  our data provide evidence that cardiac-specific overexpression of junctin is accompanied by impaired myocardial relaxation with prolonged ca(2+) transient kinetics on the cardiomyocyte level. ||| ",yes
Is there a relationship between thyroid hormone altered metabolism and coronary artery disease?,"observational studies suggest interconnections between thyroid status, metabolism, and risk of coronary artery disease (cad), but causality remains to be proven.  the present study aimed to investigate the potential causal relationship between thyroid status and cardiovascular disease and to characterize the metabolomic profile associated with thyroid status.  considerable evidence suggests that thyroid dysfunction, especially hypothyroidism, may lead to coronary artery disease (cad).  changes in thyroid hormone concentration can negatively affect the cardiovascular system.  thyroid dysfunction, both hypo- and hyperthyroidism, has been associated with cardiovascular disease.  thyroid dysfunction may affect the risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality through effects on myocardial and vascular tissue and metabolism.  heart dysfunctions have been shown to be associated with altered concentrations of thyroid hormones.  overt thyroid dysfunction, hypothyroidism in particular, may lead to coronary artery disease (cad).  the association between thyroid hormones and cardiovascular conditions has been well studied, specifically, the effects of hypothyroidism on cardiomyopathy, and hyperthyroidism with arrhythmias.  thyroid hormones affect the cardiovascular system, but the precise mechanisms of their effects on the development of atherosclerosis are not entirely clear.  most studies have concluded that thyroid dysfunction is associated with arterial wall remodeling and, thus, with increased cardiovascular risk.  because an unfavorable lipid profile would provide a possible explanation for the reported association of coronary-heart disease with this syndrome, we have evaluated the relationship of thyrotropin (tsh) with total cholesterol, low-density-lipoprotein (ldl) cholesterol, and triglycerides in patients with normal thyroid function (n = 4886) as well as subclinical (n = 1055) and manifest (n = 92) hypothyroidism.  abnormalities of thyroid function are associated with changes in lipid concentrations and in the incidence of ischaemic heart disease.  we planned this study to investigate whether serum free thyroxine (ft4) or thyroid-stimulating hormone (tsh) levels are associated with coronary artery calcification measured in healthy euthyroid subjects.  it is unclear whether thyroid hormone levels within the normal range are also associated with atherosclerosis measured by coronary artery calcium (cac).  the current study aimed to evaluate the relationship between thyroid function using thyroid-stimulating hormone (tsh) and free thyroxine (ft4) and cardiometabolic risk factors and the clustering of these risk factors (metabolic syndrome) in euthyroid children and adolescents.  to assess whether thyroid hormones may predict carotid atherosclerosis, we performed multivariate regression analyses, and we showed that, in both populations of hypothyroid and euthyroid patients, neither the tsh values nor the ft4 concentrations were independent risk factors for carotid atherosclerosis.  overt hypothyroidism is associated with an increased prevalence of cardiovascular heart disease (chd).  hypothyroidism is associated with an increased risk of coronary artery disease, beyond that which can be explained by its association with conventional cardiovascular risk factors.  to investigate the association of thyroid hormone levels with the risk of developing atherosclerosis in euthyroid t2d patients in central china. ||| ",yes
Is there a role for gamma knife in treatment of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder?,"gamma knife ventral anterior capsulotomy is an effective option to treat refractory obsessive-compulsive disorder.  the authors present their experience with gamma knife radiosurgery (gkrs) in the treatment of patients with ocd resistant to any medical therapy.  the authors evaluated their experience with gamma knife (gk) capsulotomy in treating patients with severe ocd.  gamma knife has been the treatment of choice for various brain tumors and functional disorders.  a 55-year-old man with refractory obsessive-compulsive disorder was treated with gamma knife ventral anterior capsulotomy using a dose of 180 gy.  gamma knife surgery is widely used for a number of neurological disorders.  gamma ventral capsulotomy (gvc) radiosurgery is intended to minimize side effects while maintaining the efficacy of traditional thermocoagulation techniques for the treatment of refractory obsessive-compulsive disorder (ocd).  objective functional gamma knife radiosurgery (gkrs) procedures have been increasingly used for treating patients with tremor, trigeminal neuralgia (tn), and refractory obsessive-compulsive disorder.  it has been used as a treatment option for patients with intractable obsessive-compulsive disorder (ocd) who do not respond to several first-line treatments attempts.  to determine the efficacy and safety of a radiosurgery (gamma ventral capsulotomy ) for intractable ocd.  neurosurgeries such as gamma ventral capsulotomy (gvc) are an option for otherwise intractable obsessive-compulsive disorder (ocd) patients.  gamma knife surgery (gks) is used for the treatment of various human brain disorders.  recently, whole-body gamma-knife as a kind of radiotherapy equipment, characterized by precision of targeting irradiation, was applied in clinic.  at present, gamma knife radiosurgery plays an important role in neurosurgical procedures.  gamma ventral capsulotomy benefitted patients with otherwise intractable ocd and thus appears to be an alternative to deep-brain stimulation in selected cases.  gamma knife radiosurgery has been used to treat many types of brain tumors and as a functional intervention.  select cases of intractable obsessive-compulsive disorder (ocd) have undergone neurosurgical ablation for more than half a century.  they also highlight the importance of taking into account the severity of obsessive-compulsive personality disorder symptoms when gvc is indicated for intractable ocd patients.  obsessive-compulsive disorder (ocd) is a severe psychiatric condition.  for patients with severe ocd refractory to medications and psychiatric therapy, gk capsulotomy afforded clinical improvement. ||| ",yes
Is there a role for the cylindromatosis tumor suppressor (CYLD) in lung cancer?,"the cylindromatosis tumor suppressor (cyld) has been implicated in the inhibition of human breast cancer development by virtue of the poor prognosis of patients with down-regulated cyld expression.  the tumor-suppressor cylindromatosis (cyld) is a deubiquitinating enzyme and key regulator of cell proliferation and inflammation.  the cylindromatosis (cyld) gene is involved in tumor progression by acting as a negative regulator of nuclear factor-κb (nf-κb).  cyld is a tumor suppressor that has been linked to the development of various human malignancies, including colon cancer.  cyld encodes a tumor suppressor that is mutated in familial cylindromatosis.  cyld was originally identified as a tumor suppressor that is mutated in familial cylindromatosis.  cylindromatosis (cyld) is a tumor suppressor gene that is mutated in familial cylindromatosis, a rare autosomal dominant disorder associated with numerous benign skin adnexal tumors.  cyld is a protein with tumor suppressor properties which was originally discovered associated with cylindromatosis, an inherited cancer exclusively affecting the folicullo-sebaceous-apocrine unit of the epidermis.  this study investigated the clinical significance of cyld in breast cancer and its roles in tumor progression.  the cylindromatosis (cyld) gene was originally identified as a tumor suppressor that is mutated in familial cylindromatosis, an autosomal dominant condition that confers a predisposition to multiple tumors of the skin appendages.  cyld is a tumour-suppressor gene that is mutated in a benign skin tumour syndrome called cylindromatosis.  the cylindromatosis tumor suppressor gene (cyld) encodes an enzyme (cyld) with deubiquitinating activity that has been implicated in the regulation of thymocyte selection in an nf-κb-essential-modulator (nemo)-dependent manner.  cyld is a tumor suppressor that is mutated in familial cylindromatosis, an autosomal dominant predisposition to multiple tumors of the skin appendages.  the cylindromatosis gene (cyld) encodes a deubiquitinase that was initially             identified as a tumor suppressor and has recently been investigated in connection             with a variety of normal physiological processes.  loss of cylindromatosis gene (cyld) expression has been observed in various cancers, including chronic lymphocytic leukemia (cll).  therefore, loss of cyld function correlates with tumorigenesis.  downregulation of cyld has been reported in several malignancies; however, the clinical significance of cyld expression in many malignancies, including breast cancer, remains to be elucidated.  in order to investigate the mechanism of breast cancer suppression by cyld, in the present study, cellular and molecular aspects of cyld-dependent phenotypic regulation of different types of human breast cancer cell lines were analyzed.  the cylindromatosis gene (cyld) was identified as a tumor suppressor gene, which is mutated in familial cylindromatosis (brooke-spiegler syndrome), an autosomal-dominant predisposition to multiple tumors of the skin appendages.  thus, functional relevant loss of cyld expression may contribute to tumor development and progression, and may provide a new target for therapeutic strategies. ||| ",yes
Is there a role for transcription factories in genome organization?,"there is also some evidence that transcription factories could help organize chromatin and nuclear structure, contributing to both the formation of chromatin loops and the clustering of active and co-regulated genes.  the phenomenon of association of transcribed genes into so-called transcription factories and also the role of these associations in spatial organization of the eukaryotic genome are actively discussed in the modern literature.  the transcription factory model has implications for the regulation of transcription initiation and elongation, for the organization of genes in the genome, for the co-regulation of genes and for genome instability.  some authors think that the association of transcribed genes into transcription factories constitutes a major factor supporting the function-dependent three-dimensional organization of the interphase genome.  we review here the evidence that different factories may specialize in the transcription of different groups of genes.  this organization of polymerases into clusters--which we call transcription 'factories'--has important consequences.  it has been proposed that transcription factories promote chromatin loop formation, creating long-range interactions in which relatively distant genes can be transcribed simultaneously.  our results suggest that individual factories are dynamically organized and able to respond to the increased transcriptional load imposed by multiple highly transcribed genes by significantly increasing in size.  the evidence that such factories specialize in the transcription of particular groups of genes is reviewed.  in the eukaryotic nucleus, genes are transcribed in transcription factories.  transcription factories are nuclear domains where gene transcription takes place although the molecular basis for their formation and maintenance are unknown.  we also discuss new models that can explain the biological significance of clustering of transcribed genes and show possible mechanisms of the origin of transcription factories in the course of evolution.  this review discusses the experimental evidence in support of the transcription factory model and the evidence that argues against such a spatially structured view of transcription.  these studies apply innovative technical approaches to gain insights into the molecular constituents, dynamical behaviour and organizational regulators of transcription factories, providing exciting insights into the spatial dimension of transcriptional control.  there is increasing evidence that different transcription units are transcribed together in discrete nuclear structures known as transcription factories.  in particular, highly transcribed genes, rna polymerases and transcription factors gather into discrete spatial foci called transcription factories.  the low ratio of transcription factories to active genes and transcription units suggests that genes must share factories.  we examine here whether transcription occurs in discrete sites (factories) containing the required machinery and whether these sites specialize in transcribing different genes.  several studies over the past few years have added weight to the concept that transcription takes place within discrete 'transcription factories' assembled inside the cell nucleus.  here, we review recent studies that assessed the requirement of transcription and/or the transcription machinery for the establishment or maintenance of genome topology. ||| ",yes
Is there a role of proton beam therapy in medulloblastoma treatment?,"proton radiation has been used safely and effectively for medulloblastoma, primitive neuro-ectodermal tumors, craniopharyngioma, ependymoma, germ cell intracranial tumors, low-grade glioma, retinoblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma and other soft tissue sarcomas, ewing's sarcoma and other bone sarcomas.  this review summarizes published literature to date regarding the role of proton therapy in skull base tumors and introduces emerging proton therapy approaches such as pencil-beam scanning (pbs).  proton therapy is a treatment method for variety of tumors such as brain tumor.  in the present manuscript, the literature on proton therapy for brain and skull base tumors is critically reviewed and compared with results obtained with modern photon techniques.  proton therapy offers effective treatment for a range of brain tumors.  we review the available evidence and present the current state of proton beam therapy for prostate cancer.  the following review presents the state of the art of proton therapy in the treatment of pediatric malignancies.  for benign tumors such as craniopharyngiomas, pituitary adenomas and meningiomas, proton therapy can limit long-term adverse effects, such as secondary malignancies.  in the setting of skull base tumors, proton therapy plays a critical role in the dose-escalation required for optimal tumor control of chordomas, chondrosarcomas, and malignancies of the paranasal sinuses and nasal cavity.  taken together, the data suggest that, although proton beam therapy is an effective tool for breast cancer treatment, a suitable dose is necessary to prevent metastasis-linked relapse and poor prognosis.  this supports the potential use of proton beams in tumors close to sensitive structures, such as the skull base and the brain.  proton radiotherapy may prove to be a useful therapeutic modality for the management of cutaneous malignant melanoma.  protontherapy is a rapidly expanding radiotherapy modality where accelerated proton beams are used to precisely deliver the dose to the tumor target but is generally considered ineffective against radioresistant tumors.  this review article is intended to discuss the fundamentals of pbt treatment, critically review the literature on pbt for localized prostate cancer, and describe the continued development of proton beam technology for the treatment of prostate cancer.  proton beam irradiation of uveal melanoma has great advantages compared to brachytherapy because of the homogenous dose delivered to the tumor and the possibility of sparing normal tissue close to the tumor.  a proton beam is a next generation tool to treat intractable cancer.  we describe the technique of proton beam therapy including the surgical technique of clip positioning, the radiotherapy delivery technique and the dose administered (60 gy cobalt relative biological effectiveness in 4 fractions).  although radiotherapy has been used more frequently in past decades for the management of large melanomas, long-term efficacy of proton beam irradiation (pbi) of large choroidal melanomas has not been reported.  a proton beam dose-dependently decreased cell proliferation, survival and migration in 4t1 murine breast cancer cells.  proton beam radiotherapy of uveal melanoma can be administered as primary treatment, as salvage therapy for recurrent tumor, and as neoadjuvant therapy prior to surgical resection. ||| ",yes
Is there a role of regorafenib for sarcoma treatment?,"we hypothesized that regorafenib would improve progression-free survival (pfs) in patients with sarcoma and report the results of the osteosarcoma cohort.  the multikinase inhibitor regorafenib is utilized for the treatment of malignancy.  observed pfs confirms that regorafenib warrants further clinical investigation in refractory non-adipocytic sarcomas.  the oral multi-target kinase inhibitor regorafenib, which targets the oncogenic receptor tyrosine kinase (rtk), is an effective therapeutic for patients with advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumors or metastatic colorectal cancer.  the placebo-controlled phase-2 regosarc trial demonstrated the efficacy of regorafenib in patients with leiomyosarcoma, synovial sarcoma and other non-adipocytic sarcoma but not in liposarcoma.  sarc024 is a phase ii clinical trial of the multikinase inhibitor regorafenib in specific sarcoma subtypes, including advanced osteosarcoma.  recently, several clinical trials have revealed that regorafenib has an anti-tumor activity in gastric cancer.  regorafenib is an oral multikinase inhibitor and is approved as salvage therapy in the standard treatment of advanced colorectal cancer (crc).  regorafenib, a multikinase inhibitor targeting the ras/raf/mek/erk pathway, has recently been approved for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer.  we found that regorafenib inhibited cell proliferation and invasion at the concentration of 20μmol/l and in a dose dependent manner.  regorafenib should be considered a treatment option for patients with relapsed metastatic osteosarcoma.  regorafenib is a multikinase inhibitor with antiangiogenic effects that improves overall survival (os) in metastatic colorectal cancer (mcrc) after failure of standard therapies.  the study met its primary end point, demonstrating activity of regorafenib in patients with progressive metastatic osteosarcoma.  regorafenib is an oral multikinase inhibitor for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer (mcrc).  this review summarizes the anti-tumor effects of regorafenib in single or combined treatment in preclinical models of hcc, crc and gists and discusses both the global and molecular effects that account for its anti-cancer properties in the clinical setting.  regorafenib is an oral small-molecule multi kinase inhibitor.  we investigated the efficacy and safety of regorafenib in antiangiogenic therapy-naïve chemotherapy-refractory advanced colorectal cancer.  we investigated how regorafenib suppresses colorectal cancer cell growth and potentiates effects of other chemotherapeutic drugs.  the anti-tumor effects of regorafenib on gastric cancer cells were analyzed via cell proliferation and invasion.  in snu-16 mice xenografts, regorafenib significantly inhibited tumor growth, proliferation, and fgfr signaling compared to treatment with control vehicle. ||| ",yes
Is there a sequence bias in MNase digestion patterns?,"next-generation sequencing (ngs) has also been utilized for analyses of mnase-digests, but some technical biases are commonly present in the ngs experiments.  this sequence-dependent effect was seen in spite of the finding that the relative rate of incorporation of the correct nucleotide at different positions on the template was essentially the same with mg2+ and mn2+.  however, due to its sequence preference, the interpretations of the positions and occupancies of nucleosomes using mnase have remained controversial.  digestion of chromatin with micrococcal nuclease (mnase) is widely used to probe nucleosome organization.  this discrepancy may be related to the bias towards a 1:1 ratio typically observed in heterozygous digestion products.  analysis of mnase digests by end-labeling techniques or overlapping quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qpcr) can be used to map locus-specific nucleosome positions.  commonly occurring sequence features, such as deletions and insertions, are known to affect the accuracy of msa programs, but the extent to which alignment accuracy is affected by the positions of insertions and deletions has not been examined independently of other sources of sequence variation.  here we report computer simulations which provide a simple estimator of genetic distances from the comparison of rnase a digestion patterns.  since m13mp8 and m13mp9 have their array of cloning sites in an antiparallel order, either orientation for inserting a double-digest fragment can be selected by the choice of the vector.  micrococcal nuclease (mnase) has been widely used for analyses of nucleosome locations in many organisms.  mnase-seq allows the genome-wide examination of the nucleosome landscape by determination of nucleosome positioning and occupancy.  previous work has highlighted the existence of positional bias of motifs in the dna sequences, which might indicate not only that the pattern is important, but also provide hints of the positions where these patterns occur preferentially.  although there was an overall greater tendency for misincorporation to occur in mn2+-activated chain elongation, some specific sites on the template were more prone to misincorporation with mg2+ and others with mn2+.  the presence of the above-mentioned compositional heterogeneity implies that the sequences must have evolved under more general conditions than is commonly assumed.  in data sets containing sequences with partially overlapping deletions, most msa programs preferentially aligned the gaps vertically at the expense of incorrectly aligning residues in the flanking regions.  however, from the same set of sequences different msas are often inferred, depending on the methodologies used and the assumed parameters.  we assessed the performance of 6 popular msa programs (clustalw, dialign-t, mafft, muscle, probcons, and t-coffee) and one experimental program, prank, on amino acid sequences that differed only by short regions of deleted residues.  here, we established a gel-based method to map nucleosome positions in saccharomyces cerevisiae, using isolated nuclei as the substrate for the histone h4 s47c-site-directed chemical cleavage in parallel with mnase digestion.  the results show that the number of non-shared fragments is proportional to the number of mutations between each pair of sequences compared.  the fidelity of e. coli dna polymerase i in the presence of mg2+ vs mn2+ was examined at many positions along natural dna templates, by use of an electrophoretic assay of misincorporation. ||| ",yes
Is there alternative polyadenylation during zebrafish development?,"here we provide, for the first time to our knowledge, a comprehensive list of developmentally regulated zebrafish genes and their expression profiles during embryogenesis, including novel information on the temporal expression of several thousand previously uncharacterized genes.  to address this, we have generated zebrafish transgenic for a modified genomic pac clone that expresses egfp from the wnt8a locus.  northern blotting and whole mount in situ hybridisation revealed expression of zebrafish cdk8 maternally, following the onset of zygotic transcription at the mid-blastula transition (mbt) and throughout embryonic development.  the zebrafish (danio rerio) is a popular vertebrate model for studying visual development, especially at the larval stage.  zebrafish (danio rerio) is a well-recognized model for the study of vertebrate developmental genetics, yet at the same time little is known about the transcriptional events that underlie zebrafish embryogenesis.  the zebrafish is a valuable model organism that is widely used in studies of vertebrate development.  first, we show that nacos are synthesized in vivo during early embryogenesis in the zebrafish.  the zebrafish is an important model to understand the cell and molecular biology of organ and appendage regeneration.  though many aspects of zebrafish embryonic development have been described at the morphological level, little is known about the molecular basis of cellular changes that occur as the organism develops.  here we describe the cloning and developmental expression pattern of zebrafish cdk8 mrna.  here we have employed microarray analysis to study the temporal activity of developmentally regulated genes during zebrafish embryogenesis.  whole mount in situ hybridization on zebrafish embryos shows that the transcripts of ef-2 gene are detected during the early development of zebrafish embryo and constantly change from 5-somite stage to protruding-mouth stage.  we suggest that the ubiquitous distribution of dvr-1 rna reflects a significant aspect of the developmental strategy of the zebrafish in which each blastomere retains an equivalent developmental potential throughout the cleavage period.  studies on the zebrafish model have contributed to our understanding of several important developmental processes, especially those that can be easily studied in the embryo.  finally, analysis of the expression of the zebrafish zdg42 gene, which has been suggested to be involved in synthesis of nacos, is described.  intraventricular injections of gene-specific morpholinos offer an alternative method for the current inability to genomically target zebrafish genes in a temporally controlled manner at these stages.  the zebrafish (danio rerio) is a powerful model organism to study vertebrate development.  moreover, zebrafish caspase-3 mrna was present in early embryos up to the 1000-cell stage as a maternal factor, and was then expressed throughout the body after the gastrula stage by zygotic expression.  in situ hybridization was used to localize zebrafish beta3, alpha2, and alpha7 rna expression.  the zebrafish (danio rerio) is an alluring model system currently used to study early embryonic development, organogenesis and gene functional analysis. ||| ",yes
Is there an RNAi drug being developed to treat amyloidosis?,"a number of small molecules have been designed for amyloidosis treatment.  rna interference (rnai) holds one of the promising tools for alzheimer's disease (ad) treatment by directly arresting the causative genes.  in august 2018, the fda approved the first sirna therapeutic, called onpattro™ (patisiran), for the treatment of transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis.  these findings provide rationale for further investigation of saa-specific asos as a potential therapy for aa amyloidosis.  emerging therapeutics that utilize rna interference (rnai) have the potential to treat broad classes of diseases due to their ability to reversibly silence target genes.  small interfering rna (sirna) gene therapy is a new molecular approach in the search for an efficient therapy for alzheimer disease (ad), based on the principle of rna interference.  strategies for interfering with protein aggregation are important for elucidating and controlling the pathologies of amyloid diseases.  in view of the side effects associated with inhibiting the secretases that produce aβ, new molecular targets are required to provide alternative therapeutic options.  aims: one promising approach for treatment of alzheimer's disease (ad) is use of anti-amyloid therapies, based on the hypothesis that increases in amyloid-beta (aβ) deposits in brain are a major cause of ad.  the potential of rnai therapeutics for ad using r-peg-pmt/sibace1 complexes was demonstrated in vitro and in vivo.  aa amyloid patients who experience disease progression and develop renal failure have not received sufficient benefit from agents that treat inflammation or infection.  aln-ttr01 and aln-ttr02 suppressed the production of both mutant and nonmutant forms of transthyretin, establishing proof of concept for rnai therapy targeting messenger rna transcribed from a disease-causing gene.  here we report the pharmacokinetics (pk) of aln-18328, dlin-mc3-dma, and peg2000 -c-dmg from a phase 2 multiple-ascending-dose study and its open-label extension (ole) in patients with hattr amyloidosis.  vutrisiran (aln-ttrsc02) is a liver-directed, investigational, small interfering ribonucleic acid drug for the treatment of transthyretin (ttr)-mediated amyloidosis.  for successful rnai therapeutics for ad, limited access of therapeutic genes to the brain needs to be overcome by developing sirna delivery system that could cross the blood-brain barrier (bbb).  our goal was to use newly discovered app 5' utr directed compounds to limit amyloid-beta (abeta)-peptide output in cell culture systems.  currently, >20 small interfering rna (sirna)-based therapies are in clinical trials for a wide variety of diseases including cancers, genetic disorders, and viral infections.  we have previously identified compounds that block the cellular toxicity of the beta-amyloid peptide, but the relationship between their ability to inhibit toxicity and their affinity for a beta is unknown.  small molecules derivatives of congo red have been shown to inhibit aβ aggregation and protect against aβ neurotoxicity in vitro.  patisiran is an rna interference therapeutic comprising a novel, small interfering ribonucleic acid (aln-18328) formulated in a lipid nanoparticle targeted to inhibit hepatic transthyretin protein synthesis. ||| ",yes
Is there an association between FGFR3 mutation and plagiocephaly?,"to determine whether the autosomal dominant fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (fgfr3) pro250arg mutation causes anterior plagiocephaly, patients with either apparently sporadic unicoronal synostosis (n = 37) or other forms of anterior plagiocephaly (n = 10) were studied for this mutation.  we now show that a much more variable clinical presentation accompanies analogous mutation in the fgfr3 gene.  pathogenic allelic variants in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (fgfr3) gene have been associated with a number of phenotypes including achondroplasia, hypochondroplasia, thanatophoric dysplasia, crouzon syndrome with acanthosis nigricans (crouzonodermoskeletal syndrome), and saddan (severe achondroplasia with developmental delay and acanthosis nigricans).  specific mutations in the fgfr3 gene are associated with autosomal dominant human skeletal disorders such as hypochondroplasia, achondroplasia, and thanatophoric dysplasia.  germline specific point mutations in the gene encoding fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (fgfr3) are associated with autosomal dominant human skeletal dysplasia and craniosynostosis syndromes.  fgfr3 (fibroblast growth factor receptor 3) is a gene responsible for the most common form of osteodysplasia, achondroplasia, which results in extreme short stature.  the c749g (pro250arg) mutation in the gene for fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (fgfr3) has been found in patients with various types of craniosynostosis.  germline mutations of the gene encoding human fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (fgfr3) have been shown to be responsible for several related autosomal dominant forms of syndromic craniosynostosis and short limb dwarfism.  a mutation (n540k) in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (fgfr3) gene was described in some patients with this condition.  none of the 6 patients with nonsynostotic plagiocephaly and none of the 4 patients with additional suture synostosis had the fgfr3 mutation.  fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (fgfr3) gene mutations in the germline are well-known causes of skeletal syndromes.  mutations in the fibroblast growth factor receptor (fgfr) gene family recently have been shown to underlie several hereditary disorders of bone development, with specific fgfr3 mutations causing achondroplasia (ach) and thanatophoric dysplasia (td).  a unique pro250arg mutation in fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (fgfr3) was recently found in patients with non-syndromic craniosynostosis.  activating mutations within fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (fgfr3), a receptor tyrosine kinase, are responsible for human skeletal dysplasias including achondroplasia and the neonatal lethal syndromes thanatophoric dysplasia types i and ii.  the c749g mutation in fgfr3 is a frequent cause of apparently non-syndromic coronal craniosynostosis.  missense mutations of human fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (fgfr3) result in several skeletal dysplasias, including hypochondroplasia, achondroplasia and thanatophoric dysplasia.  these data provide direct genetic evidence that the point mutations in fgfr3 cause human skeletal dysplasias and uncover a mechanism through which the fgfr3 signals regulate bone growth by modulating expression of stats and ink4 cell cycle inhibitors.  many patients with a clinical diagnosis of ""nonsyndromic"" coronal craniosynostosis have been found to be heterozygous for the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (fgfr3) mutation pro250arg.  mutations in the fgfr3 gene cause the phenotypic spectrum of fgfr3 chondrodysplasias ranging from lethal forms to the milder phenotype seen in hypochondroplasia (hch).  several mutations involving the fibroblast growth factor receptor (fgfr) gene family have been identified in association with phenotypically distinct forms of craniosynostosis. ||| ",yes
Is there an association between Histone H3.3 mutations and glioma?,"mutations in histone h3 are key molecular drivers of pediatric and young adult high-grade gliomas.  mutations in the histone 3 variant h3.3 have been identified in one-third of pediatric glioblastomas (gbms), but not in adult tumors.  recurrent specific mutations in evolutionarily conserved histone 3 (h3) variants drive pediatric high-grade gliomas (hggs), but little is known about their downstream effects.  somatic mutations on h3 histone are currently considered a genetic hallmark for midline pediatric high-grade gliomas (hggs).  somatic mutations of the h3f3a and hist1h3b genes encoding the histone h3 variants, h3.3 and h3.1, were recently identified in high-grade gliomas arising in the thalamus, pons and spinal cord of children and young adults.  recently, distinct and recurrent mutations in a specific histone variant, histone h3.3, have been implicated in a high proportion of malignant pediatric brain cancers.  recurrent somatic mutations of h3f3a in aggressive pediatric high-grade gliomas generate k27m or g34r/v mutant histone h3.3.  mutations of histone variant h3.3 are highly recurrent in childhood glioblastoma and in young adults with giant cell tumor of the bone (gctb).  two recurrent mutations, k27m and g34r/v, in h3f3a, encoding non-canonical histone h3.3, are reported in pediatric and young adult gliomas, whereas g34w mutation is prevalent in bone tumors.  recurrent mutations at key lysine residues in the histone variant h3.3 are thought to play an etiologic role in the development of distinct subsets of pediatric gliomas and bone and cartilage cancers.  point mutations within the histone h3.3 are frequent in aggressive childhood brain tumors known as pediatric high-grade gliomas (phggs).  histone h3 point mutations have been identified in incurable pediatric brain cancers, but the mechanisms through which these mutations drive tumorigenesis are incompletely understood.  however, genome-wide sequencing of pediatric high-grade gliomas revealed somatic heterozygous mutations in the genes encoding histones h3.1 and h3.3, as well as mutations in the chromatin modifiers atrx and daxx.  here, we report 2 rare cases of histologically low-grade gliomas with gemistocytic morphology and sequencing-confirmed histone h3 g34r mutations.  histone h3 encoding genes, particularly h3f3a and h3f3b, the genes encoding the variant histone h3.3, are mutated at high frequency in pediatric brain and bone malignancies.  the presence of mutant h3.3 histone disrupts epigenetic posttranslational modifications near genes involved in cancer processes and in brain function.  while comprehensive molecular profiling of histone h3.3 mutant pediatric high-grade glioma has revealed extensive dysregulation of the chromatin landscape, the exact mechanisms driving tumor formation remain poorly understood.  here, we describe a series of 47 diffuse midline gliomas with histone h3-k27m mutation.  since histone modifications can lead to major epigenetic changes with direct impact on prognosis and treatment, we thought to investigate the occurrence of h3f3a k27m and g34r/v mutations in a cohort of pediatric tumors which included hggs, low-grade gliomas, ependymomas, medulloblastomas, and a series of rare brain tumor lesions of different histologies.  histone h3 g34r mutations occur in hemispheric high-grade gliomas and h3 k27m mutations occur in aggressive, though histologically diverse, midline gliomas. ||| ",yes
Is there an association between Klinefelter syndrome and breast cancer?,"klinefelter syndrome has been consistently associated with breast cancer in men (mbc).  breast cancer in a patient with klinefelter's syndrome is reported.  to evaluate male breast cancer (mbc) risk among patients with klinefelter syndrome (ks) and relate this to possible biological explanations.  the strongest association between aberrant endocrine function and male breast cancer occurs in patients with klinefelter's syndrome, who have an approximate 3% lifetime risk of developing breast cancer.  klinefelter's syndrome is known to be associated with various malignancies including male breast cancer and germ cell tumour.  those affected by klinefelter's syndrome are at increased risk of systemic lupus erythematosus, breast cancer, non-hodgkin's lymphoma, and lung cancer.  klinefelter syndrome is associated with the development of breast and extragonadal germ cell tumors in some patients.  klinefelter syndrome, in which patients carry xxy chromosome, may be present in men with breast cancer for this reason they often develop gynecomastia.  the increased conversion of testosterone to estradiol at the therapy with androgens might be responsible for the development of breast cancer in klinefelter's syndrome.  patients with a 47,xxy karyotype (klinefelter syndrome) appear to have an increased risk of developing cancer, especially male breast cancer and germ cell tumors, but rarely malignant hematologic disorders.  the various theories of etiology concerning breast cancer in this syndrome are reviewed.  we report a 54-year old man was diagnosed as synchronous bilateral breast cancer with klinefelter syndrome.  we describe a patient with klinefelter's syndrome associated with multi-focal breast carcinoma and paget's disease of the nipple.  the etiology of male breast cancer is obscure, although an excess risk has been associated with klinefelter syndrome, testicular disorders, benign breast disease including gynecomastia, use of exogenous estrogens, radiation, and a family history of male or female breast cancer.  although the association could be casual, the sex hormone imbalance present in klinefelter syndrome may suggest a role in the development of this benign liver lesion.  these data suggest a correlation between primary extragonadal germ cell tumors and klinefelter syndrome.  epidemiological studies have highlighted a higher incidence of morbidity and mortality among individuals with klinefelter's syndrome (ks), however, the relative impact of oncological diseases on ks subjects is still uncertain.  previous reports have associated klinefelter's syndrome with increased risk of thrombosis.  these data are the first to show an association of klinefelter's syndrome with an autoimmune disease found predominantly in women.  the pathogenesis of these otherwise rare neoplasms probably is related to the genetic abnormality and the abnormal hormonal status in klinefelter's syndrome. ||| ",yes
Is there an association between Muenke Syndrome and FGFR3 gene mutation?,"muenke syndrome is an autosomal dominant craniosynostosis syndrome resulting from a defining point mutation in the fibroblast growth factor receptor3 (fgfr3) gene.  muenke is a fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (fgfr-3)-associated syndrome, which was first described in late 1990 s. muenke syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized mainly by coronal suture craniosynostosis, hearing impairment and intellectual disability.  muenke syndrome is a craniosynostosis syndrome associated with the p.pro250arg mutation in fgfr3.  muenke syndrome is characterized by various craniofacial deformities and is caused by an autosomal-dominant activating mutation in fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (fgfr3(p250r)               ).  muenke syndrome caused by the fgfr3 pro250arg mutation is associated with craniosynostosis, hearing loss, and various bony anomalies.  to better understand the pathophysiology of the muenke syndrome, we present collective findings from several recent studies that have characterized a genetically equivalent mouse model for muenke syndrome (fgfr3 (p244r)) and compare them with human phenotypes.  muenke syndrome caused by the fgfr3(p250r) mutation is an autosomal dominant disorder mostly identified with coronal suture synostosis, but it also presents with other craniofacial phenotypes that include mild to moderate midface hypoplasia.  muenke syndrome, also known as fgfr3-associated coronal synostosis, is defined molecularly by the presence of a heterozygous nucleotide transversion, c.749c>g, encoding the amino acid substitution pro250arg, in the fibroblast growth factor receptor type 3 gene (fgfr3).  the heterozygous pro250arg substitution mutation in fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (fgfr3), which increases ligand-dependent signalling, is the most common genetic cause of craniosynostosis in humans and defines muenke syndrome.  this familial case illustrates the variable expressivity of muenke syndrome in association with an identical gene mutation.  muenke syndrome, defined by heterozygosity for a pro250arg substitution in fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (fgfr3), is the most common genetic cause of craniosynostosis in humans.  the muenke syndrome (ms) is characterized by unicoronal or bicoronal craniosynostosis, midfacial hypoplasia, ocular hypertelorism, and a variety of minor abnormalities associated with a mutation in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (fgfr3) gene.  sixteen individuals from 5 danish families with muenke syndrome are presented.  muenke syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by coronal suture craniosynostosis, hearing loss, developmental delay, carpal and tarsal fusions, and the presence of the pro250arg mutation in the fgfr3 gene.  in this case report, we focus on muenke syndrome (ms), a disease caused by the p.pro250arg variant in fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (fgfr3) and characterized by uni- or bilateral coronal suture synostosis, macrocephaly without craniosynostosis, dysmorphic craniofacial features, and dental malocclusion.  temporal lobe abnormalities and focal epilepsy have been documented in fgfr3-related clinical condition, including hypochondroplasia and muenke syndrome.  muenke syndrome (mim #602849), the most common syndromic craniosynostosis, results from the recurrent pathogenic p.p250r variant in fgfr3.  therefore, the fgfr3 (p244r) mouse provides an excellent opportunity to study disease mechanisms of some classical phenotypes of muenke syndrome and to test novel therapeutic strategies.  we have used gene targeting to introduce the muenke syndrome mutation (equivalent to p244r) into the murine fgfr3 gene.  the muenke syndrome mutation (fgfr3 (p250r)), which was discovered 15 years ago, represents the single most common craniosynostosis mutation. ||| ",yes
Is there an association between TERT promoter mutation and survival of glioblastoma patients?,"in this study we investigated the tert promoter mutations and their impact on patient survival in world health organization grade iv glioblastoma multiforme (gbm).  these findings demonstrate that tert promoter mutations are novel prognostic markers for gliomas that can inform prospective therapeutic strategies.  in conclusion, tert promoter mutation is a promising biomarker for predicting worse prognosis for patients with gliomas.  the occurrence of tert promoter mutations in gliomas is frequent.  prognostic value of tert promoter mutations in gliomas is dependent on tumor grade and the idh mutational status.  tert promoter mutations were specific to gliomas.  hazard ratios from survival analysis of glioma patients were determined relative to the presence of tert promoter mutations.  our results showed that tert promoter mutation was associated with a superior outcome in mgmt-methylated gliomas (hr = 0.73; 95% ci = 0.55-0.98; p-value = 0.04), whereas this mutation was associated with poorer survival in gliomas without mgmt methylation (hr = 1.86; 95% ci = 1.54-2.26; p-value < 0.001).  there are controversial results concerning the prognostic implication of tert promoter mutation in glioma patients concerning mgmt status.  meta-analysis of total 11 studies suggested that tert promoter mutations were significantly associated with worse prognosis of patients with gliomas (hr = 2.07, 95% ci = 1.58-2.71, p < 0.00001).  meta-analysis of nine studies with adjusted outcomes suggested that tert promoter mutations were independently associated with worse prognosis of patients with gliomas (hr = 2.28, 95% ci = 1.72-3.01, p < 0.00001).  tert mutation is preferentially present in glioblastoma and idh-wt gliomas and is associated with poor prognosis.  tert promoter mutations were detected in 101 glioma samples (grades i-iv) and 49 other brain tumors by sequencing.  our study shows that the tert gene is a valuable prognostic and predictive biomarker of glioma, and tert gene polymorphisms are significantly associated with an increased risk of glioma.  tert mutation is significantly associated with compromised overall survival (os) (hr=1.38; 95% ci=1.15-1.67) and progression-free survival (pfs) (hr=1.31; 95% ci=1.06-1.63) in glioma patients.  human telomerase reverse transcriptase (tert) promoter mutations are important genetic alterations in many kinds of human malignancies, including glioma.  tert promoter mutations maintained its ability of inducing high transcriptional activity even under hypoxic and tmz treatment conditions, and the presence of mutations was associated with poor prognosis in glioma patients.  the clinical significance of telomerase reverse transcriptase (tert) promoter mutation in glioma remains unclear.  the current study aimed to investigate the anatomical specificity of tert promoter mutations in glioblastomas (gbms).  mutations in the promoter region of the telomerase reverse transcriptase gene (tertp) are associated with diagnosis and poor prognosis in gliomas. ||| ",yes

Is there an association between borna virus and brain tumor?,"borna disease virus (bdv) is one of the potential infectious agents involved in the development of central nervous system (cns) diseases.  serological and molecular epidemiological studies indicate that borna disease virus (bdv) can infect humans and is possibly associated with certain neuropsychiatric disorders.  borna disease virus (bdv), the prototypic member of the family bornaviridae within the order mononegavirales, provides an important model for the investigation of viral persistence within the central nervous system (cns) and of associated brain disorders.  borna disease virus (bdv) can induce neurological disease in animals.  due to persistent infections of human central nervous system (cns), polyomaviruses have been identified as one of the risk factors for brain tumor development.  borna disease virus (bdv) causes central nervous system (cns) disease that is frequently manifested by behavioral abnormalities.  to estimate the frequency of persistent borna disease virus (bdv) infections of the human central nervous system and to determine which neuropsychiatric disorders might be associated with this viral infection, reverse transcription-nested polymerase chain reaction was used to screen a large collection of autopsy brain samples for the presence of bdv-specific nucleic acids.  borna disease (bd) has been recognized as a virally induced t-cell dependent immunopathological disorder of the central nervous system (cns), as shown by experimental infection of rats with borna disease virus (bdv).  taken together, in the present study low copy numbers of bk virus tag gene was detected in brain tumor cells, which can indicate that bk virus may contribute to tumor induction by indirect mechanisms or neuro-persistence of this virus without any pathological consequences.  more recently a number of head and neck tumors have been shown to harbor the virus, suggesting a possible role for ebv in their development.  association of some neurotropic viruses like borna disease virus and herpes virus with schizophrenia is better explained.  in primary brain tumors, bk virus sequences were recognized more frequently in schwannomas (15.5%) and meningiomas (12.1%).  the significance of viral pathogens in brain tumors is controversial, and human cytomegalovirus (hcmv) has been associated with glioblastoma (gbm) in some but not all studies, making the role of hcmv unclear.  whether borna disease virus (bdv-1) is a human pathogen remained controversial until recent encephalitis cases showed bdv-1 infection could even be deadly.  viruses are thought to be involved in some neurological diseases, the presence of subfractions of viral dna has been reported in various circumstances and the oncogenicity of some viruses has been demonstrated in animal experiments.  having a large bank of tumor material available, we systematically examined 39 brain tumors using southern blot hybridization with dnas of three viruses, known to be involved in neurological diseases: herpes simplex virus (hsv), simian virus 40 (sv40) and adenovirus type 2 (ad2).  to assess the prevalence of bk virus sequences, a total of 58 fresh brain tumors were examined by quantitative real-time pcr.  indications exist in the scientific literature that infection with human herpes family viruses may contribute to the pathogenesis of neuroblastoma (nb).  little is known about oncogenesis in brain tumors.  viral pathogens have been implicated in the development of certain cancers including human papillomavirus (hpv) in squamous cell carcinoma and epstein-barr virus (ebv) in burkitt's lymphoma. ||| ",no
Is there an association between bruxism and reflux,"recent advances have clarified the relationship between gastroesophageal reflux and sleep bruxism (sb).  the pathophysiological processes of tooth wear may be complicated by the relationship between bruxism and gastroesophageal reflux disease (gerd).  bruxism with reflux symptoms for extensive time-periods was associated with severe tooth wear for the whole dentition (odds ratio, 4.70, 95% confidence interval, 2.04⁻10.83).  there seems to be an association between bruxism, respiratory problems, and dental caries in children.  the aim of the present study was to determine whether there is an association between respiratory problems and dental caries in children who exhibit the habit of bruxism.  a statistically significant association was found between respiratory problems and dental caries among the children with bruxism.  in conclusion, strong associations were identified among bruxism, gerd, and tooth wear.  after adjustment, gerd was identified as a risk factor of bruxism.  background reflux disease is a common gastrointestinal problem.  rhythmic masticatory muscle activity, including sleep bruxism (sb), can be induced in healthy individuals by experimental esophageal acidification, which plays an important role in the pathogenesis of gastroesophageal reflux disease (gerd).  successful treatment of sleep-related respiratory effort may lead to improved or resolution of bruxism in cases where such a causal relationship does exist.  support to the existence of an association between bruxism and psychosocial disorders has been provided.  sleep bruxism is prevalent in gerd patients, and gerd is highly associated with sb.  the objective of this study was to evaluate the associations among bruxism, gerd, and tooth wear.  the association between reflux disease and gastritis pattern is controversial.  current proposed causes of bruxism appear to be a combination of genetic and environmental (g×e) factors, with epigenetics providing a robust framework for investigating g×e interactions, and their involvement in bruxism makes it a suitable candidate for epigenetic research.  the aim of this case-control study was to assess the existence of an association between bruxism and psychosocial disorders in adolescents., participants were chosen among 114, 12-14 year old students (girls).  bruxism is often indicated as a risk factor for the occurrence of temporomandibular disorders (tmd).  bruxism is highly prevalent and defined as abnormal habitual mouth activity including clenching of the teeth and increased jaw muscle activity.  gastro-esophageal reflux is considered a major culprit in the pathogenesis of barrett's esophagus (be). ||| ",yes

Is there an association between c-reactive protein concentrations and outcomes of subarachnoid hemorrhage patients?,"this study aimed to examine prospectively whether the inflammatory marker c-reactive protein (crp) increases in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage (asah) treated by endovascular coiling and investigate whether crp could be used as prognostic factor for long-term neurological outcome.  several studies showed a correlation between c-reactive protein and mortality in spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage.  this review and meta-analysis investigated associations of systemic inflammatory marker c-reactive protein (crp) and white blood cell count (wbc) with occurrence of delayed cerebral ischemia (dci) and poor functional outcome after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (asah).  cytokines and cytokine receptor concentrations increase in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (csf) of patients following subarachnoid haemorrhage (sah).  activation of the inflammatory generating complement system might play a pathogenic role in spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage (sah).  this study suggests that h24-c-reactive protein may be a more reliable marker than initial c-reactive protein in the prediction of mortality in intracerebral hemorrhage.  to assess the time course and correlation of systemic inflammatory parameters with outcome and the occurrence of delayed ischemic neurological deficits (dinds) after subarachnoid hemorrhage.  besides the baseline characteristics, daily interleukin-6 (il-6), procalcitonin, c-reactive protein levels, and leukocyte counts were prospectively measured until day 14 after subarachnoid hemorrhage.  the purpose of this study was to determine if initial or h24-c-reactive protein is independently associated with 30-day mortality in intracerebral hemorrhage.  il-6csf seems to be a reliable early marker for predicting vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage on days 3 after treatment before clinical onset.  we analyzed both daily clinical manifestation and laboratory data of csf in 46 patients who suffered from intracranial aneurismal subarachnoid hemorrhage during a period of 14 days, studied the relationship between the development of vasospasm and the quantities of the inflammatory factor, revealing potential power of il-6 for predicting vasospasm detected by transcranial doppler (tcd).  although plasma c-reactive protein (crp) is elevated in response to inflammation caused by brain infarction, the association of crp with clinical outcomes after acute ischemic stroke remains uncertain.  only h24-c-reactive protein, hematoma volume, and infratentorial origin were independently associated with 30-day mortality in intracerebral hemorrhage.  the goal of this study was to explore whether the levels of soluble adhesion molecules were elevated in cerebrospinal fluid (csf) after subarachnoid hemorrhage (sah).  high-sensitivity c-reactive protein (hs-crp) is a well-recognized biomarker of neurologic complications and clinical outcome of stroke patients.  early cerebral hypoperfusion and ischemia occur after subarachnoid hemorrhage (sah) and influence clinical prognosis.  aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (asah) patients have an inflammatory response in the cerebrospinal fluid (csf).  high-sensitivity c-reactive protein (hs-crp) as a prognostic factor of stroke has been proposed and studied.  c-reactive protein (crp) is an inflammatory biomarker of inflammation and may reflect progression of vascular disease.  the role and impact of systemic inflammatory response after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage remain to be elucidated. ||| ",yes
Is there an association between carcinoid syndrome and mitral valve disease?,"more than half of patients with carcinoid syndrome develop carcinoid valve disease.  carcinoid valve and heart disease is a frequent occurrence in patients with carcinoid syndrome and is accountable for substantial morbidity and mortality.  carcinoid syndrome may involve right carcinoid heart disease (chd), secondary to the release of vasoactive substances.  carcinoid heart disease occurs in over 65% of patients with the carcinoid syndrome and is characterized by fibrous thickening of cardiac valves, leading to heart failure.  carcinoid heart disease is characterized by tricuspid valve regurgitation and varying degrees of pulmonary valve regurgitation or stenosis.  the carcinoid syndrome is rare but it is associated with carcinoid heart disease in more than a half of the cases.  carcinoid involvement of left-sided heart valves has been reported in patients with a patent foramen ovale, carcinoid tumor of the lung, and active carcinoid syndrome with high levels of serotonin.  carcinoid valve and heart disease is characterized by the plaque-like, endocardial fibrous tissue deposits, primarily affecting the right heart endocardium and valves, which result as a consequence of the disease process.  carcinoid heart disease is a well-known complication of carcinoid syndrome that affects morbidity and mortality.  we report a case of carcinoid initially presenting with rapid development of right heart failure due to severe pulmonary valve stenosis.  two hundred fifty-two patients with carcinoid syndrome were prospectively followed with serial echocardiograms at 6-month intervals.  carcinoid heart disease (chd) is a rare complication of neuroendocrine tumors, most commonly involving the tricuspid and pulmonary valves.  carcinoid heart disease occurs in approximately half of patients who have carcinoid syndrome and is the leading cause of death among these patients.  carcinoid heart disease is typically characterised by morphological and functional modifications of right-sided valves.  carcinoid heart disease is a heterogeneous disease with a wide spectrum of echocardiographic findings.  using this novel animal model of carcinoid syndrome, the tricuspid valve thickening resembling carcinoid heart disease could be due to exposure to factors such as serotonin secreted by carcinoid tumor cells.  potential mechanisms for the carcinoid valve disease include the complex role of excess serotonin and its interaction with serotonin receptors and transporters.  carcinoid syndrome causes a rare form of acquired valvular heart disease which typically occurs in the setting of liver metastases.  the diagnosis of carcinoid syndrome should be recognized as an etiology in patients with organic tricuspid and pulmonary regurgitation without left valvular disease.  twenty-two patients with carcinoid heart disease underwent cardiac valve surgery between 2006 and 2010. ||| ",yes
Is there an association between presenteeism and depression?,"univariate linear regression confirmed a negative linear relationship between depression severity and presenteeism, which remained significant after controlling for age, gender, industry, and work position.  depression is both highly prevalent and debilitating and is linked to increases in absenteeism and presenteeism.  significant relationships between depression severity and both absenteeism and presenteeism were present indicating increases in absence and decreases in performance with increasing severity.  depression is reported to be a major cause of illness-related sub-optimal work performance (presenteeism).  we aimed to explore both the relationship between absenteeism and presenteeism and both depression severity, along with the independent contributions of different symptoms.  we also examined whether there was an interaction between current and past depression in their effects on cognitive performance.  marital status, housing tenure and co-morbid mental disorders were important indicators of presenteeism behavior.  participants with current depression had significantly higher levels of psychological distress and anxiety, and lower life satisfaction and performed worse on memory and executive function compared to participants without current depression.  the relationship between depressive symptoms, absenteeism and presenteeism was estimated using both total summed scores and individual symptoms of depression.  presenteeism and absenteeism were significantly worse in those with depression only and anxiety only compared to those with non-clinical symptom levels.  survey adjusted multivariable logistic regression assessed classification of 12-month, depression-related presenteeism on the basis of socio-demographic, financial, work and health factors.  many studies show that rumination is related to current depressive episodes but very few studies have examined whether rumination is elevated among those with a history of diagnosed depression.  a history of depression was associated with worse executive function, higher levels of psychological distress and anxiety, and lower life satisfaction.  depressive symptoms are common in the elderly and they have been associated with cognitive and functional impairment.  the aim of this cross-sectional study was to assess whether current depressive symptoms and past depression are associated with cognitive or functional impairment in a community-based sample representative of east sydney, australia.  these results support the view that current and past depressive episodes are associated with poorer cognitive performance but not with functional abilities.  previous studies revealed that acute depressive episodes are associated with both cognitive deficits and modified personality patterns in late life.  depression is a typical case in point.  employees experiencing depression can take a sickness absence or continue working ('presenteeism').  johnson's relative weights analysis showed contributory differences amongst depression symptoms in relation to presenteeism and absenteeism. ||| ",yes
Is there an association between serum interleukin-6 concentrations and outcomes of stroke patients?,"the present study set out to evaluate the relationship between serum levels of interleukin-6 with long-term and at-hospital outcomes of acute ischemic stroke in patients hospitalized at imam khomeini hospital, urmia, iran, from 2017 to 2018.  in addition, il-6 concentrations affect clinical outcomes in ischemic stroke.  we explored an association between ex vivo cytokine release, circulating interleukin (il)-6 as a marker of systemic inflammation, and stroke prognosis.  interleukin-6 (il-6) is reportedly increased in serum and csf from acute stroke patients.  interleukin-6 (il-6) is pleiotropic cytokine involved in many central nervous system disorders including stroke, and elevated serum il-6 has been found in acute stroke patients.  interleukin-6 (il-6) is one of the inflammatory mediators characterized by elevated levels in ischemic stroke (is) patients.  interleukin-6 (il-6) is among the inflammatory mediators exhibiting elevated levels in ischemic stroke (is) patients.  the evidence from the present study suggests that il-6 contributes to determination of severity of ischemic stroke.  interleukin-6 (il-6) is a pleiotropic cytokine that plays a central role in the pathogenesis of stroke.  several studies have highlighted the role of interleukin-6 (il-6) as an early signal of the inflammatory response following acute ischemic stroke.  il-6 and tnf-alpha release from stimulated blood cells was increased in stroke patients, compared to controls.  the evidence from the present study suggests that il-6 contributes to the determination of the severity of ischemic strokes and may be useful in predicting prognosis.  cytokines interleukin (il)-6 and tumor necrosis factor (tnf)-alpha can play pathogenetic or protective roles in stroke.  in conclusion, the results show a complex but potentially beneficial effect of intravenously administered il-6 in experimental stroke.  our study investigated the frequency of interleukin-6 (il-6) promoter polymorphism rs1800795 (-174 g>c), possible association of this polymorphism with il-6 levels and the outcome after stroke in 95 patients with acute ischemic stroke and 268 healthy subjects.  the aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between il-6 and sil-6r in stroke patients.  we hypothesized that concentrations of interleukin 6 (il-6), serum amyloid a, tumor necrosis factor-α receptor 1, cd40 ligand, and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 would predict recurrent ischemic stroke and major vascular events after recent lacunar stroke.  pro-inflammatory il6 trans-signaling, estimated by the b/t ratio, is associated with ischemic stroke in individuals without af.  this study demonstrates the potential of employing hs-il-6 as an early stage biomarker for the prognosis of acute ischemic stroke.  clinically, il-6 values obtained in the first week post-stroke have been shown to correlate with infarct size and outcome. ||| ",yes
Is there an increased risk for cancer in Dyskeratosis Congenita?,"different types of neoplasia have been reported in association with dyskeratosis congenita.  dyskeratosis congenita (dc) is characterized by multiple features including mucocutaneous abnormalities, bone marrow failure and an increased predisposition to cancer.  dyskeratosis congenita is a disorder of poor telomere maintenance and is known to increase the risk of developing multiple types of malignancy.  approximately 8% of patients with dyskeratosis congenita have malignancy, but information about the development of malignancy in patients with dyskeratosis congenita is limited.  in dyskeratosis congenita, the hyperkeratotic lesions affecting the mucous membranes have a propensity to undergo malignant change.  dyskeratosis congenita (dc) is an inherited bone marrow failure syndrome associated with increased cancer susceptibility.  recent studies have identified upregulation of the dyskeratosis congenita 1 (dkc1) gene in association with various sporadic cancers.  dyskeratosis congenita is a rare, hereditary, multisystem disorder characterized by mucocutaneous changes, pancytopenia and increased incidence of malignancy.  our patient developed rectal cancer at an early age of onset compared with the previously reported typical onset age of patients with dyskeratosis congenita.  dyskeratosis congenita (dc) is an inherited disorder characterized by reticular pigmentation of the skin, dystrophic nails, mucosal leukoplakia, and a predisposition to cancer in early adult life.  dyskeratosis congenita is an inherited syndrome characterised by mucocutaneous features, bone marrow failure, an increased risk of malignancy and other somatic abnormalities.  germline mutations in the tumour suppressor gene dyskeratosis congenit 1 (dkc1) cause the cancer prone syndrome called x-linked dyskeratosis congenita.  dyskeratosis congenita (dc) is a rare inherited disorder characterized by bone marrow failure, dystrophic changes in the skin and mucous membranes, and a predisposition to malignancy.  dyskeratosis congenita (dc) is a rare hereditary disorder characterized by bone marrow failure, cancer predisposition (11-fold increase compared to general population), ectodermal dysplasia (nail dystrophy, oral leukoplakia, and abnormal skin pigmentation) and other additional somatic abnormalities.  dyskeratosis congenita (dc) is a multisystem bone marrow failure syndrome characterized by a triad of mucocutaneous abnormalities and an increased predisposition to malignancy.  dyskeratosis congenita (dc) is a rare genodermatosis characterised by a classic triad of dystrophic nails, reticular skin pigmentation and mucous membrane leukoplakic patches, which have a high rate of malignant transformation.  these data suggest that a heightened susceptibility in dna cross-links may be of fundamental importance in the etiology of dyskeratosis congenita.  dyskeratosis congenita is a rare x-linked recessive disease, characterized by mucosal leukokeratosis, nail dystrophy, telangiectasia, reticulated hyperpigmentation, pancytopenia, and a heightened susceptibility to infection and malignancy.  ""dyskeratosis congenita (dc) also known as zinsser-engman-cole syndrome is a rare multi-system bone marrow failure syndrome characterised by mucocutaneous abnormalities and an increased predisposition to cancer"".  the same missense variant was previously reported in two patients with dyskeratosis congenita as a pathogenic variant, but those patients did not develop malignancies. ||| ",yes
Is there any algorithm for enhancer identification from chromatin state?,"candidate enhancers can be identified on the basis of chromatin modifications, the binding of chromatin modifiers and transcription factors and cofactors, or chromatin accessibility.  recent genome-wide chromatin states mapping efforts revealed that dna elements are associated with characteristic chromatin modification signatures, based on which several approaches have been developed to predict transcriptional enhancers.  various experimental and computational approaches including chromatin signature profiling have been developed to predict enhancers on a genome-wide scale, although each method has its advantages and disadvantages.  considering the importance of enhancers, enhancer identification is a prevailing problem in computational biology.  enhancers are known to be associated with certain epigenetic signatures.  machine learning tools, such as csi-ann, chromhmm, and rfecs, were developed for predicting enhancers using various epigenetic features.  enhancer is a dna sequence of a genome that controls transcription of downstream target genes.  in this aspect, several bioinformatics tools have been developed to identify enhancers.  computational methods have been developed to predict the genomic locations of active enhancers based on histone modifications, but the accuracy and resolution of these methods remain limited.  here we overview an emerging method to identify transcribed enhancers at exceedingly high nucleotide resolution based on enhancer rna transcripts captured by cap analysis of gene expression (cage) technology.  what is the best way to identify regulatory dna sequences such as enhancers, promoters, insulators and silencers?  overall, our study presents a novel framework for accurately identifying enhancers from epigenetic data across multiple cell types.  as millions of enhancers have been identified, high-throughput tools are needed to determine enhancer function on a genome-wide scale.  due to its sporadic distribution and similar fractions, identification of enhancers from the human genome seems a daunting task.  in summary, our model which used this ensemble approach could identify enhancers with achieved sensitivity of 75.5%, specificity of 76%, accuracy of 75.5%, and mcc of 0.51.  accurate enhancer identification is critical for understanding the spatiotemporal transcriptional regulation during development as well as the functional impact of disease-related noncoding genetic variants.  here, we present an algorithm, regulatory element prediction based on tissue-specific local epigenetic marks (reptile), which integrates histone modification and whole-genome cytosine dna methylation profiles to identify the precise location of enhancers.  an enhancer is a short region of dna with the ability to recruit transcription factors and their complexes, increasing the likelihood of the transcription of a particular gene.  in this paper, we propose a novel two-layer enhancer predictor called ienhancer-kl, using computational biology algorithms to identify enhancers and then classify these enhancers into strong or weak types.  our studies have important implications to how transcriptional enhancers are defined and how they regulate gene expression. ||| ",yes
Is there any association between Jarid2 and miR-155 in Th17 cells?,"our results have demonstrated that mir-141-3p and mir-200a-3p are th17 cell-associated mirnas and their expression level is upregulated significantly during th17 cell induction.  this study aimed to clarify the involvement of mir-141-3p and mir-200a-3p in th17 cell differentiation as well as explore their potential target genes involved.  consequently, we examined the role of mir-155 in differentiated th17 cells during their induction of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis.  small molecules that can modulate mir-155 may potentially provide new therapeutic avenues to inhibit th17 cell-mediated autoimmune diseases.  gene expression profiling of purified mir-155(-/-)il-17f(+) th17 cells identified a subset of effector genes that are dependent on mir-155 for their proper expression through a mechanism involving repression of the transcription factor ets1.  microrna mir-155 is an important regulatory molecule in the immune system and is highly expressed and functional in th17 cells, a subset of cd4+ t helper cells which are key players in autoimmune diseases.  overall, our results have identified two novel th17 lineage-associated mirnas and have provided evidence for the rarb-dependent mechanism of mir-141-3p and mir-200a-3p-induced th17 cell differentiation and hence th17-mediated autoimmunity.  taken together, our study demonstrates a critical role for mir-155 in th17 cells as they unleash autoimmune inflammation and finds that this occurs through a signaling network involving mir-155, ets1, and the clinically relevant il-23-il-23r pathway.  in conclusion, mir-155 is over-expressed and may be involved in ad pathogenesis by modulating the differentiation and function of th17 cells.  positive correlations were found between mir-155 expression and ad severity, th17 cell percentage, rorγt mrna expression and il-17 mrna expression and plasma concentration, while negative correlations were observed between mir-155 expression and socs1 mrna expression and plasma concentration in ad peripheral circulation and skin lesions.  the microrna-155 (mir-155) is regarded as a central modulator of t-cell responses and could be a potential therapeutic target for certain inflammatory diseases.  th17 cells are central to the pathogenesis of autoimmune disease, and recently specific noncoding micrornas have been shown to regulate their development.  moreover, the serum levels of il-4 and il-17a, secreted by th2 and th17 cells, were lower in mir-155(-/-)fas(lpr/lpr) than fas(lpr/lpr) mice; the cd4(+)/cd8(+) t cell ratio was restored in mir-155(-/-)fas(lpr/lpr) mice as well.  microrna-155 (mir-155) was previously found involved in the development of systemic lupus erythematosus (sle) and other autoimmune diseases and the inflammatory response; however, the detailed mechanism of mir-155 in sle is not fully understood.  mir-182 contributes to genetic susceptibility of bd and vkh.  our aims were to identify the differential expression of microrna (mir)-155, as well as to explore the possible regulatory effects of mir-155 on the differentiation and function of t helper type 17 (th17) cells in atopic dermatitis (ad).  significantly increased expression of mir-182 in tt/ct cases compared to cc cases was observed.  microarray analysis, rt-pcr, western blot, and luciferase reporter gene assay were used to identify the target gene of mir-155.  to explore the in vivo role of mir-155 in the pathogenesis of sle, mir-155-deficient fas(lpr/lpr) (mir-155(-/-)fas(lpr/lpr)) mice were obtained by crossing mir-155(-/-) and fas(lpr/lpr) mice.  we observed the over-expression of mir-155 in the peripheral mononuclear cells of patients with pss. ||| ",yes
Is there any association of the chromosomal region harboring the gene ITIH3 with schizophrenia?,"common single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) in or near the inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor heavy chain h3 (itih3) gene have been repeatedly associated with schizophrenia and related psychiatric disorders in genome-wide association studies.  a recent genome-wide analysis indicated that a polymorphism (rs2535629) of itih3 showed the strongest association signal with susceptibility to psychiatric disorders in caucasian populations.  here, we provide the first study to assess the relevance of the itih3 rs2535629 snp in response to antipsychotic medication.  several genome-wide association studies and case-control studies regarding psychiatric disorders have identified itih3 and itih4 single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps).  here, we provide evidence that the functional variants at the chi3l1 locus influence the genetic risk of schizophrenia.  in order to explore the association of itih3 with asd, the present study included three components: identifying the spatial-temporal expression of itih3 in the developing human brain using the expression data from the allen institute for brain science; examining the cis-acting regulatory effect of snps on the itih3 expression using uk brain expression consortium database; validating the effect of identified snps using a case-control study with samples of 602 cases and 604 controls.  our findings identify chi3l1 as a potential schizophrenia-susceptibility gene and suggest that the genes involved in the biological response to adverse environmental conditions are likely to play roles in the predisposition to schizophrenia.  genome-wide association studies (gwas) have identified a region at chromosome 1p21.3, containing the microrna mir137, to be among the most significant associations for schizophrenia.  the public expression data showed that itih3 may have a role in the development of human brain and suggested a cis-eqtl effect for rs2535629 and rs3617 on itih3 in the hippocampus.  the chitinase 3-like 1 gene (chi3l1) is abnormally expressed in the hippocampus of subjects with schizophrenia and may be involved in the cellular response to various environmental events that are reported to increase the risk of schizophrenia.  first, using case-control and transmission/disequilibrium-test (tdt) methodologies, we detected a significant association between schizophrenia and haplotypes within the promoter region of chi3l1 in two independent cohorts of chinese individuals.  genetic studies have found that the interleukin-1β gene (il1b, 2q13) influences the risk for schizophrenia, but the underlying biological mechanisms of the association are still unclear.  recently, mild linkage disequilibrium has been observed with a polymorphic marker that maps within the g(olf) gene and schizophrenia in families from germany and israel, suggesting that a gene mapping near g(olf) may be involved in psychiatric disorders.  interleukin-1 beta is a cytokine implicated in the development of the central nervous system and therefore its gene is a candidate gene in schizophrenia.  linkage studies have suggested a locus for bipolar disorder as well as schizophrenia in the pericentric region of chromosome 18.  synapsin iii plays a role in neuronal plasticity and maps to chromosome 22q12-13, a region suggested to be linked to schizophrenia.  our results provide further evidence for an effect of the disc1 gene on the etiology of schizophrenia and suggest that strs in the disc1 gene may be genetic risk factors for schizophrenia.  convergent lines of evidence supported itih3 rs25352629 as a susceptibility variant for asd.  disrupted-in-schizophrenia-1 (disc1) is a promising susceptibility gene for major mental illness, but the mechanism of the clinical association is unknown.  these genes may be possible candidate genes for psychiatric illness. ||| ",yes
Is there any cross-talk between the Wnt and the Akt pathways?,"wnts activate at least two signaling pathways, the β-catenin-dependent and -independent pathways.  to our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating a direct cross-talk between akt and src in endothelial-barrier regulation.  abnormal wnt signaling is often observed in human cancers.  wnt ligands trigger the activation of a variety of β-catenin-dependent and β-catenin-independent intracellular signaling cascades.  multiple signaling pathways, including wnt signaling, participate in animal development, stem cell biology, and human cancer.  we focused on the roles of wnt4, wnt5a and wnt6, which are thought to be part of the non-canonical wnt pathway.  wnt5a regulates multiple intracellular signalling cascades, but how wnt5a determines the specificity of these pathways is not well understood.  alterations in the wnt signaling pathway have been implicated in alzheimer's disease; however, its role in the processing of the amyloid precursor protein remains unknown.  wnt5a is a representative wnt ligand that can activate both β-catenin-dependent canonical and β-catenin-independent noncanonical wnt pathways.  this study examined whether the internalization of wnt receptors affects the ability of wnt5a to regulate its signalling pathways.  these results suggest that wnt5a regulates distinct pathways through receptor internalization-dependent and -independent mechanisms.  to date, most data regarding the crosstalk between the wnt signaling pathway and the yap/taz transcriptional coactivators focuses on the wnt/β-catenin branch of the pathway.  our data demonstrate that in human bbb cells the expression of pgp is controlled by a cross-talk between canonical and non-canonical wnt pathways.  the dopamine d2 receptor (d2dr) regulates akt and may also target the wnt pathway, two signalling cascades that inhibit glycogen synthase kinase-3 (gsk-3).  moreover, wnt5a and yap expression are significantly correlated in specific cancer types, suggesting that the crosstalk between yap/taz and the wnt pathway is more intricate than previously thought.  to investigate the expression of wnt and tgf-β signaling and the crosstalk between these 2 signaling pathways in aga.  these results suggest that the noncanonical wnt pathway might be critically important in gastric carcinogenesis.  despite the variations in intracellular signaling, wnt pathways share the effector proteins frizzled, dishevelled, and β-arrestin.  recent experiments have explored effects of activities of kinases other than the well-studied gsk3beta, in wnt pathway signaling, particularly at the level of beta-catenin.  recent studies suggest that ift-a proteins and kinesin-2 modulate canonical wnt/wg-signalling independently of their ciliary role. ||| ",yes
Is there any data to suggest that TRH (thyrotropin releasing hormone) administration can improve symptom severity of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients?,"thyrotropin releasing hormone (trh) has potential therapeutic applications in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (als) and related diseases because of its function as a neuroregulator of the anterior horn cell.  thyrotropin-releasing hormone (trh) is now used as a therapeutic agent for various neurological disorders.  trh has rapid-onset (30 sec), slow-offset (1-12 days) clinical benefit in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and other motor neuron disorders.  thyrotropin-releasing hormone (trh) and some of its stable analogues have been shown to improve neurologic dysfunctions such as brain trauma in both animals and humans.  thyrotropin-releasing hormone (trh) and some of its stable analogues have recently been shown to improve functional recovery after neurologic dysfunctions, such as brain trauma and epilepsy, in both animals and humans.  numerous preclinical studies have demonstrated that posttraumatic treatment of spinal cord injury (sci) with thyrotropin-releasing hormone (trh) or trh analogs improves long-term behavioral recovery.  protirelin (thyrotropin-releasing hormone) appears to be a neuromodulator in the extrahypothalamic nervous system and has been suggested as an adjunct in the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (als).  thyrotropin-releasing hormone (trh) has been shown to improve memory both in animal amnesia models and in humans.  thyrotropin-releasing hormone (trh), a tripeptide amide with molecular formula l-pglu-l-his-l- pro-nh2, is used in the treatment of brain/spinal injury and certain central nervous system (cns) disorders, including schizophrenia, alzheimer's disease, epilepsy, depression, shock and ischemia due to its profound effects on the cns.  treatment with thyrotropin releasing hormone (trh) or trh analogues improves outcome after experimental brain or spinal cord trauma.  thyrotropin releasing hormone (trh) improves cerebellar ataxia and cerebellar perfusion in patients with spinocerebellar degeneration.  the purpose of the present study is to provide preliminary data regarding the safety and potential efficacy of trh in patients with acute sci.  clinical studies have been divided on the efficacy of protirelin (trh) despite strong experimental findings that are consistent with a role for the peptide in als.  we have thus explored the direct intrathecal administration of trh in als, with both short-term boluses and infusions and chronic constant infusions.  thyrotropin-releasing hormone (trh; protirelin), a brain-derived tripeptide, has shown efficacy in the treatment of such disorders, yet its mechanism of neuroprotection is poorly understood.  it is not known whether trh therapy can improve the cerebellar regional cerebral blood flow (rcbf) or not in patients with cerebellar variant of multiple-system atrophy (msa-c).  our case suggests that thyrotropin-releasing hormone therapy is worth trying as a treatment of late cortical cerebellar atrophy.  there have been occasional reports that trh therapy was effective for improving symptoms of persistent disturbance of consciousness after acute encephalitis or encephalopathy during childhood.  the efficacy of thyrotropin-releasing hormone tartrate (trh-t) for treating prolonged disturbance of consciousness due to aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (sah) remains unclear.  trh treatment was associated with significantly higher motor, sensory, and sunnybrook scores than placebo treatment. ||| ",yes
Is there any functional association during viral replication between flaviviridae viral RNA depended RNA polymerase and viral helicase?,"viral genome replication in flaviviridae is carried out by a virally encoded rna-dependent rna polymerase (rdrp).  although flaviviruses encode their own helicases, evidence suggests that cellular helicases are also required for replication and/or assembly of these viruses.  rna elements within the flavivirus genome may play essential regulatory roles during virus replication.  to our knowledge, this is the first study showing that enzymatic activity of a cellular helicase is critical for infectivity of flaviviruses.  genome replication of hepadnavirus proceeds by reverse transcription from a viral pregenomic rna template by a virally encoded polymerase that possesses protein-priming, reverse transcriptase, dna polymerase, and rnase h activities.  the interaction between viral polymerases and their cognate rnas is vital to regulate the timing and abundance of viral replication products.  we study the biochemical interactions using two viral polymerases that could serve as models for other plus-strand rna viruses: the replicase from the tripartite brome mosaic virus (bmv), and the recombinant rna-dependent rna polymerase (rdrp) from hepatitis c virus (hcv).  some enzymatic activities are generally associated with rna viruses such as rna- or dna-dependent rna polymerases, rna helicases or proteases.  rna replication and packaging are mediated by several viral proteins, of which vp1, the rna-dependent rna polymerase, and vp2, the core scaffolding protein, were shown to be sufficient to provide replicase activity in vitro.  genome replication in flavivirus requires (-) strand rna synthesis, (+) strand rna synthesis, and 51-rna capping and methylation.  the association of host proteins with viral rna replication proteins has been reported for a number of (+)-strand rna viruses.  in the present study, we demonstrate that the helicase activity of this enzyme is essential for its role in assembly of infectious wnv virions.  to carry out viral genome replication, flavivirus assembles a replication complex, consisting of both viral and host proteins, on the cytoplasmic side of the endoplasmic reticulum (er) membrane.  an assay for flavivirus rna-dependent rna polymerase activity in vitro was established using extracts of vero cells infected with dengue virus type 2 (den-2) or kunjin virus (kun).  these functions during replication include the recruitment of the viral rna to the site of replication and assembly of the functional viral replicase complex.  in this review, we discuss our current knowledge of the multiple levels at which flavivirus rna synthesis is controlled.  rna synthesis and replication of the members of the flavivirus genus (including dengue, west nile and japanese encephalitis viruses) is regulated by a wide variety of mechanisms and actors.  replication of hepadnaviruses involves reverse transcription of an intermediate rna molecule.  in the case of flaviviruses, a model has been proposed that involves the recognition of an rna element present at the viral 5' untranslated region, stem-loop a (sla), that serves as a promoter for ns5 polymerase binding and activity.  this process is likely to be carried out by a virally encoded, multifunctional polymerase which possesses dna- and rna-dependent dna polymerase and rnase h activities. ||| ",yes
Is there any involvement of L1 retrotransposition in the Rett syndrome?,"l1 (line-1) is an interspersed non-ltr retrotransposon and several genetic defects caused by l1 transposition have been reported.  like other non-ltr retrotransposons, l1 insertion into chromosomal dna apparently occurs by target-site primed reverse transcription, or tprt.  rett syndrome is usually sporadic, but rare pedigrees with nonpenetrance in obligate carriers and possible anticipation suggest that it could be caused by a triplet repeat expansion (tre).  in mammalian genomes, most retrocopies emerged via the l1 retrotransposition machinery.  l1s can retrotranspose in the germline, during early development and in select somatic cells; however, the host response to l1 retrotransposition remains largely unexplored.  these data suggest that de novo l1 retrotransposition events may occur in the human brain and, in principle, have the potential to contribute to individual somatic mosaicism.  de novo line-1 (long interspersed element-1, or l1) retrotransposition events are responsible for approximately 1/1,000 disease-causing mutations in humans.  rett syndrome is a progressive neurological development syndrome.  retrotransposition requires two l1-encoded proteins, orf1p and orf2p.  l1 retrotransposition has shaped our genome via insertional mutagenesis, sequence transduction, pseudogene formation, and ectopic recombination.  l1s must retrotranspose in the germ line or during early development to ensure their evolutionary success, yet the extent to which this process affects somatic cells is poorly understood.  a large fraction of the human genome is attributable to l1 retrotransposon sequences.  individual l1 elements within a genome differ in sequence and retrotransposition activity.  nonetheless, l1 expression has been shown to be increased in patients with rett syndrome and schizophrenia.  the line-1 (l1) retrotransposon emerges as a major source of human interindividual genetic variation, with important implications for evolution and disease.  long interspersed element 1 (line-1 or l1) retrotransposons have markedly affected the human genome.  l1 is a ubiquitous interspersed repeated sequence in mammals that achieved its high copy number by autonomous retrotransposition.  recently, retrotransposition of l1 was shown to occur within human brain leading to somatic mosaicism in hippocampus and cerebellum.  long interspersed element-1 retrotransposons (line-1 or l1) are ∼6 kb mobile dna elements implicated in the origins of many mendelian and complex diseases.  long interspersed element-1 (line-1 or l1) retrotransposition continues to affect human genome evolution. ||| ",yes
Is there any involvement of the long non-coding RNA Gomafu in schizophrenia?,"gomafu/miat/rncr2 is a long noncoding rna that has been proposed to control retinal cell specification, stem cell differentiation and alternative splicing of schizophrenia-related genes.  long non-coding rna gomafu is involved in diabetes-related diseases.  gomafu (also referred to as rncr2/miat) was originally identified as a noncoding rna expressed in a particular set of neurons.  rna sequencing analyses identified a small number of genes affected by the deficiency of gomafu, a subset of which are known to have important neurobiological functions.  unlike protein-coding mrnas, the gomafu rna escapes nuclear export and stably accumulates in the nucleus, making a unique nuclear compartment.  the long noncoding rna gomafu/miat/rncr2 is thought to function in retinal cell specification, stem cell differentiation and the control of alternative splicing.  in this study, we identified the rna-binding protein celf3 as a novel gomafu-associating protein.  we propose that the gomafu rna regulates splicing efficiency by changing the local concentration of splicing factors within the nucleus.  our results partially support the previous studies in other ethnic groups and indicate that the grm3 gene may play an important role in the etiology of schizophrenia in the han chinese.  our findings suggest that gsk3β is likely a risk gene for schizophrenia, and its expression alteration caused by the risk snp in the promoter region may contribute to the etiology of schizophrenia.  this exploratory study suggests that nrg1 may be involved in determining stg size in schizophrenia, and may play a role in the neurogenetic basis of the language disturbances seen in this disorder.  the potential role of signal transducing guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory protein (g protein) in schizophrenia is largely unknown.  it has been proposed that neuregulin 1 (nrg1) might be a promising gene involved in schizophrenia, because of its role in neurodevelopment and neuroplasticity.  dysfunction of neuronal signal transduction via g-protein has previously been speculated to be involved in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia.  the grin1 gene plays a fundamental role in many brain functions, and its involvement in the pathogenesis of the schizophrenia has been widely investigated.  these observations suggest that gomafu indirectly modulates the function of the splicing factors sf1 and celf3 by sequestering these proteins into separate nuclear bodies.  these observations suggest that gomafu modifies mouse behavior thorough a mild modulation of gene expression and/or alternative splicing of target genes.  regulator of g-protein signaling 4 is regarded as a candidate gene for schizophrenia risk.  these results suggest a defect of the endogenous gaba system in chronic schizophrenia.  the hypothesis of a gamma-aminobutyric acid (gaba) involvement in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia has been recently proposed but not confirmed. ||| ",yes
Is there any linear-time and linear-space algorithm for the computation of avoided words in biological sequences?,"the problem of finding the shortest absent words in dna data has been recently addressed, and algorithms for its solution have been described.  it has been noted that longer absent words might also be of interest, but the existing algorithms only provide generic absent words by trivially extending the shortest ones.  we describe an algorithm for generating minimal absent words that, in practice, runs in approximately linear time.  nevertheless, the number of minimal absent words is still manageable since it grows at most linearly with the string size, unlike generic absent words that grow exponentially.  we show how absent words relate to the repetitions and structure of the data, and define a new and larger class of absent words, called minimal absent words, that still captures the essential properties of the shortest absent words introduced in recent works.  both the algorithm and the concepts upon which it depends shed additional light on the structure of absent words and complement the existing studies on the topic.  because the set of minimal absent words that we propose is much larger than the set of the shortest absent words, it is potentially more useful for applications that require a richer variety of absent words.  in this note, we point out a very efficient statistic to detect over- and under-represented words in dna sequences, when markov chain models are used to represent the sequences.  efficient searching for specific subsequences in a set of longer sequences is an important component of many bioinformatics algorithms.  in order to show a use of local decoding, we propose a very basic dissimilarity measure between sequences which can be computed both from local decoding of order n and composition in subwords of length n. the accuracies of these two dissimilarities are evaluated, over several datasets, by computing their linear correlations with a reference alignment-based distance.  here we define and study the ""local decoding of order n of sequences,"" an alternative that avoids some drawbacks of ""subwords of length n"" approaches while keeping informations about environments of length n in the sequences (""decoding"" is taken here in the sense of hidden markov modeling, i.e., associating some state to all positions of the sequence).  given two sequences, a pattern of length m, a text of length n and a positive integer k, we give two algorithms.  this paper presents a very simple and efficient algorithm that searches for sequence homology and gene duplication.  there are a few algorithms designed to solve the problem of the optimal alignment of one sequence, the pattern, of length m, with another, longer sequence the text, of length n. these algorithms allow mismatches, deletions and insertions.  the genome-wide search for non-coding rnas requires efficient methods to compute and compare local secondary structures.  an algorithm is presented for the generation of sets of non-interacting dna sequences, employing existing thermodynamic models for the prediction of duplex stabilities and secondary structures.  this approach, where multiple word variants are used at each tandem word position, allows very large sets of non-interacting dna strands to be assembled from combinations of the individual words.  subword composition plays an important role in a lot of analyses of sequences.  a dna 'word' structure is employed in which individual dna 'words' of a given length (e.g.  we present an algorithm for computing the local decoding of order n of a given set of sequences. ||| ",yes
Is there any link between CTF4 and CTF18 during sister chromatid cohesion?,"the physical and genetic interactions between ctf4, ctf18, and core components of replication fork complexes observed in this study and others suggest that both gene products act in association with the replication fork to facilitate sister chromatid cohesion.  ctf4/and-1 is a highly conserved gene product required for both dna replication and the establishment of sister chromatid cohesion.  we find that absence of either ctf4 or ctf18 causes sister chromatid cohesion failure and leads to a preanaphase accumulation of cells that depends on the spindle assembly checkpoint.  ctf7 is an essential gene in yeast that is required for the formation of sister chromatid cohesion.  ctf4p (chromosome transmission fidelity) has been reported to function in dna metabolism and sister chromatid cohesion in saccharomyces cerevisiae.  the alternative pcna loader containing ctf18-dcc1-ctf8 facilitates sister chromatid cohesion (scc) by poorly defined mechanisms.  one of the proliferating cell nuclear antigen loader complexes, ctf18-replication factor c (rfc), is involved in sister chromatid cohesion.  while recent studies have provided insights into how sister chromatid cohesion is established, less is known about how specifically ctf7 facilitates the formation of cohesion, and essentially nothing is known about how sister chromatid cohesion is established in plants.  ctf4 and ctf18 are required for high-fidelity chromosome segregation.  the requirement for ctf4 and ctf18 in robust cohesion identifies novel roles for replication accessory proteins in this process.  furthermore, ctf4p interacts with mcm10p physically and genetically, and the chromatin association of ctf4p depends on mcm10p.  chromosome transmission fidelity 4 (ctf4) is a conserved protein required for dna replication.  we found that ctf18 interacts with a replicative dna polymerase, dna polymerase ε (pol ε).  in addition to mediating sister chromatid cohesion during the cell cycle, the cohesin complex associates with ctcf and with active gene regulatory elements to form long-range interactions between its binding sites.  ctf18 associates with chromatin during s phase, and it is required for the proper resumption of replication after fork arrest.  recent identification and characterization of the budding yeast polymerase kappa, encoded by trf4, strongly supports a hypothesis that the dna replication machinery is required for proper sister chromatid cohesion.  we show that both ctf4(s143f) and ctf4delta strains have defects in s phase entry and s phase progression at the restrictive temperature of 38 degrees c. ctf4p localizes in the nucleus throughout the cell cycle but only starts to bind chromatin at the g1/s transition and then disassociates from chromatin after dna replication.  these data indicate that ctf4p facilitates mcm10p to promote the dna replication.  in this report, interactions between human ctf4 (hctf4) and the replicative helicase containing the cell division cycle 45 (cdc45)/minichromosome maintenance 2-7 (mcm2-7)/go, ichi, nii, and san (gins) (cmg) proteins  were examined.  three subunits that are specifically required for cohesion in yeast, ctf18, dcc1, and ctf8, formed a trimeric complex (18-1-8) and together enabled stable binding with pol ε. ||| ",yes
Is there any link between ERCC1-XPF and cohesin?,"to characterize the specific interaction between xpf and ercc1, we expressed the human ercc1 binding domain of xpf (xpf-eb) and the xpf binding domain of ercc1 (ercc1-fb) in escherichia coli.  the ercc1 protein has been predicted to form part of a tight complex with a protein partner, the yet-unidentified xpf/ercc4 protein, in normal human cells.  cross-linking experiments at high salt concentrations revealed that xpf interacts with ercc1 mainly through hydrophobic interactions.  the xpf binding sites of ercc1 were located in helices h1 and h3 and in the c-terminal region, similar to the involved surface of xpf.  estrogen-responsive genes most significantly influenced by cohesin were enriched in pathways associated with breast cancer progression such as pi3k and erbb1.  xpf-ercc1 is also found to interact with trf2, a duplex telomeric dna binding protein.  in mcf7 breast cancer cells, cohesin depletion enhanced transcription of tff1 and tff2, and was associated with increased er binding and increased interaction between tff1 and its distal enhancer situated within tmprss3.  we found that cohesin modulates the expression of only a subset of genes in the er transcription program, either activating or repressing transcription depending on the gene target.  our data indicates that cohesin is not a universal facilitator of er-induced transcription and can even restrict enhancer-promoter communication.  functional studies have provided insights into the binding of ercc1-xpf to various dna substrates.  the amount of ercc1 protein expressed in five different xp-f cell strains was 1/ 5-1/34 of that of the protein in normal and xp cell strains representing other complementation groups.  the binding of cohesin to euchromatic regions is largely mediated by ctcf or the mediator complex.  genome-wide binding of cohesin in breast cancer cells frequently coincides with estrogen receptor alpha (er), leading to the hypothesis that cohesin facilitates estrogen-dependent gene transcription.  the transcriptional function of cohesin is thought to derive from its ability to connect distant regulatory elements with gene promoters.  the human xpf-ercc1 protein complex is one of several factors known to be required for general nucleotide excision repair.  the xpf/ercc1 heterodimeric complex is essentially involved in nucleotide excision repair (ner), interstrand crosslink (icl), and double-strand break repair.  ercc1 is not associated with a defect in any of the known human ner disorders: xeroderma pigmentosum, cockayne's syndrome or trichothiodystrophy.  the xpf-eb heterodimeric interface is larger than the xpf-eb homodimeric one, which could explain why xpf has a stronger affinity for ercc1 than for a second molecule of xpf.  our data provide insights into xpf-ercc1 architecture and catalytic activation.  ercc1 and ercc4 have an interactive relationship with poly (adenosine diphosphate ribose) polymerase (parp). ||| ",yes
Is there any link between conserved noncoding elements and alternative splicing in vertebrates?,"to the extent that such sequences might be recognized by the splicing machinery, this conservation may be a derived result of evolution for efficient splicing.  we hypothesized that intronic elements that regulate alternative splicing are under selective pressure for evolutionary conservation.  alternative splicing (as) regulates diverse cellular and developmental functions through alternative protein structures of different isoforms.  to study the possible correlation between these conserved intronic sequences and alternative splicing regulation, we developed a method to identify exons that are alternatively spliced in both human and mouse.  alternative splicing events that are conserved in orthologous genes in different species are commonly viewed as reliable evidence of authentic, functionally significant alternative splicing events.  multi-species conserved non-coding elements occur in the vertebrate genome and are clustered in the vicinity of developmentally regulated genes.  whether sl trans-splicing has a common evolutionary origin and biological function among different organisms remains unclear.  many of the high-scoring nematode pentamer and hexamer motifs correspond to known mammalian splicing regulatory sequences, such as (t)gcatg, indicating that the mechanism of alternative splicing regulation is well conserved in metazoans.  our results suggest that the function of many of the intronic sequence blocks that are conserved between human and mouse is the regulation of alternative splicing.  a comparison of the analysis of the conserved intronic elements, and analysis of the entire introns flanking these same exons, reveals that focusing on intronic conservation can increase the sensitivity of detecting putative splicing regulatory motifs.  we compared the frequency of pentamers and hexamers in the conserved intronic elements to a dataset of all c. elegans intron sequences in order to identify short intronic motifs that are more likely to be associated with alternative splicing.  many alternative splicing events are regulated by pentameric and hexameric intronic sequences that serve as binding sites for splicing regulatory factors.  this approach also identified novel sequences whose role in splicing is under investigation and has allowed us to take a step forward in defining a catalog of splicing regulatory elements for an organism.  alternatively, such conserved sequences might be remnants of proto-splice sites, which might have existed early in eukaryotic genes and served as the targets for the insertion of introns, as has been proposed by the introns-late theory.  in vivo experiments on the alternatively spliced let-2 gene confirm that these conserved regions can be important for alternative splicing regulation.  further, we have also defined a measure of the variation of the arrangement of exonic splicing enhancers (ese-conservation score) to study the evolution of splicing regulatory sequences.  these findings suggest that alternative splicing of symmetrical and non-symmetrical exons is governed by different selective pressures and serves different purposes.  vertebrate genomes share numerous conserved non-coding elements, many of which function as enhancer elements and are hypothesised to be under evolutionary constraint due to a need to be bound by combinations of sequence-specific transcription factors.  alternative splicing of pre-mrna is a commonly used mechanism to regulate gene expression in higher eukaryotes.  replacement of mrna 5' utr sequences by short sequences trans-spliced from specialized, noncoding, spliced leader (sl) rnas is an enigmatic phenomenon, occurring in a set of distantly related animal groups including urochordates, nematodes, flatworms, and hydra, as well as in euglenozoa and dinoflagellates. ||| ",yes
Is there any link between the aurora B kinase and the polycomb protein ring1B?,"the ring1b is a core subunit protein of the prc1 (polycomb repressive complex 1), which plays key roles in the regulation of the homeobox gene expression, x-chromosome inactivation, stem cell self-renewal, and tumorigenesis.  ring1 and yy1 binding protein (rybp), a new member of the polycomb group protein family, has been reported to play an important role in various biological processes.  polycomb group proteins ring1b and bmi1 (b-cell-specific moloney murine leukaemia virus integration site 1) are critical components of the chromatin modulating prc1 complex.  aurora kinase b (aurkb) plays a pivotal role in the regulation of mitosis and is gaining prominence as a therapeutic target in cancers; however, the role of aurkb in retinoblastoma (rb) has not been studied.  histone h2a ubiquitination by the prc1 complex strongly depends on the ring1b protein.  to study the function of kyot, yeast two-hybrid was performed and proteins interacting with kyot2 including ring1 and hpc2 (human polycomb 2) that belong to pcg(polycomb group) were analyzed.  these data provide a foundation for understanding the critical enzymatic activity at the core of the prc1 polycomb complex, which is implicated in stem cell maintenance and cancer.  the rybp protein has been promoted as a polycomb group (pcg)-associated protein, but its molecular function has remained elusive.  the rybp interacting pcg protein ring1b, a known ubiquitin e3 ligase, promotes rybp ubiquitination.  we solved the crystal structure of the ring-ring heterodimeric complex of ring1b and bmi1.  here we show that the e3-ligase activity of ring1b on histone h2a is enhanced by bmi1 in vitro.  all four e2s promote autoubiquitination of ring1b without affecting e3-ligase activity.  moreover, one target of rybp's ubiquitin binding domain appears to be ubiquitinated histone h2a; this histone is a substrate for ring1b's e3 ligase activity in association with gene silencing processes.  the n-terminal ring-domains are sufficient for this activity and ring1a can replace ring1b.  the c-terminal region of ring1b interacts with rybp, a transcriptional repressor in transiently transfected cells, and also with m33, another transcriptional repressor involved in mesoderm patterning.  interactions of kyot2 with ring1 and hpc2 suggested that pcg family might be involved in notch signaling pathway.  in the structure the arrangement of the ring-domains is similar to another h2a e3 ligase, the brca1/bard1 complex, but complex formation depends on an n-terminal arm of ring1b that embraces the bmi1 ring-domain.  previous studies have proposed that cbl is also a positive regulator of crkl-c3g signalling, which leads to rap1 activation.  aurkb is overexpressed in rb, and targeting it could serve as a novel therapeutic strategy to restrict tumor cell growth.  here, we show that cbl deficiency results in enhanced activation of rap1. ||| ",yes
Is there any protein that undergoes both mono-ubiquitination and poly-ubiquitination?,"proteins can be both mono- or poly-ubiquitinated.  addition of ubiquitin or ubiquitin chains to target proteins leads to their mono- or polyubiquitination, respectively.  ubiquitination involves the attachment of ubiquitin (ub) to lysine residues on substrate proteins or itself, which can result in protein monoubiquitination or polyubiquitination.  ubiquitination is a versatile and dynamic post-translational modification in which single ubiquitin molecules or polyubiquitin chains are attached to target proteins, giving rise to mono- or poly-ubiquitination, respectively.  ubiquitination involves the attachment of ubiquitin to lysine residues on substrate proteins or itself, which can result in protein monoubiquitination or polyubiquitination.  protein (poly-)ubiquitination is a posttranslational modification that plays a key role in almost all cellular processes.  in the current review, we discuss mechanisms utilized by the ub-conjugating and ub-ligase enzymes to generate structural diversity during protein ubiquitination, with a focus on recent mechanistic insights into protein monoubiquitination and polyubiquitination.  ubiquitination is a post-translation modification in which ubiquitin chains or single ubiquitin molecules are appended to target proteins, giving rise to poly- or monoubiquitination, respectively.  the ability of the ubiquitination pathway to generate different protein-ub structures provides versatility of this pathway to target proteins to different fates.  protein ubiquitination is a multi-functional post-translational modification that affects all cellular processes.  ubiquitylation is best known for its role in protein turnover.  the functional consequences of the type of ubiquitination vary, such that polyubiquitinated proteins are targeted for degradation by the proteasome, whereas monoubiquitination is implicated in other cellular functions, including endocytic trafficking and dna repair.  protein ubiquitination requires a cascade of three enzymes, where the interplay between different ubiquitin-conjugating and ubiquitin-ligase enzymes generates diverse ubiquitinated proteins topologies.  the activity, localization and fate of many cellular proteins are regulated through ubiquitination, a process whereby one or more ubiquitin (ub) monomers or chains are covalently attached to target proteins.  ubiquitination is an important post-translational process involving attachment of the ubiquitin molecule to lysine residue/s on a substrate protein or on another ubiquitin molecule, leading to the formation of protein mono-, multi- or polyubiquitination.  these include monoubiquitinated proteins, polyubiqutinated proteins with homotypic chains through a particular lysine on ub or mixed polyubiquitin chains generated by polymerization through different ub lysines.  ubiquitination is one of the most common post-translational modifications of proteins, and mediates regulated protein degradation among other cellular processes.  here, we discuss the potential cellular strategies for generating monoubiquitinated proteins using a few, relatively well characterized examples of monoubiquitinated proteins.  ubiquitination is an important post-translational protein modification that functions in diverse cellular processes of all eukaryotic organisms.  overall, our results imply that ubiquitination can modify the biophysical properties of the attached protein in the folded state and that, in some proteins, different ubiquitination sites will lead to different biophysical outcomes. ||| ",yes
Is there any relationship between histone ubiquitylation and splicing?,"recent studies have provided strong evidence for a regulatory link among chromatin structure, histone modification, and splicing regulation.  ubiquitin regulates many cellular processes, but its potential roles during splicing are unknown.  here we show that splicing regulator hu proteins can induce local histone hyperacetylation by association with their target sequences on the pre-mrna surrounding alternative exons of two different genes.  we have developed a new strategy that reveals a direct role for ubiquitin in the dynamics of splicing complexes.  these results suggest that histone modifications impact splicing of distinct subsets of genes using distinct pathways.  these results reveal a previously unknown ubiquitin-dependent mechanism for controlling the pre-mrna splicing pathway.  we investigated whether a causal relationship exists between splicing and chromatin modification by asking whether splice-site mutations affect the methylation of histone h3k36.  furthermore, semi-quantitative mass spectrometry on purified nuclear mrnps and chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis on intron-containing genes indicated that h2b ubiquitylation, but not set1-, set2- or dot1-dependent h3 methylation, stimulates recruitment of the early splicing factors, namely u1 and u2 snrnps, onto nascent rnas.  ubiquitination of histones provides an important mechanism regulating chromatin remodeling and gene expression.  a ubiquitin mutant (i44a) that can enter the conjugation pathway but is compromised in downstream functions diminishes splicing activity by reducing the levels of the u4/u6-u5 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snrnp).  histone ubiquitylation has been speculated to directly influence the structure and dynamics of nucleosomes.  with the aid of the recently developed ubiquitinated histone-specific antibodies, an intriguing link between histone ubiquitination and cancer development has been established.  these results suggest that the cotranscriptional splicing apparatus influences establishment of normal patterns of histone modification.  commitment to splicing occurs co-transcriptionally, but a major unanswered question is the extent to which various modifications of chromatin, the template for transcription in vivo, contribute to the regulation of splicing.  post-translational modifications (e.g., ubiquitylation) of histones play important roles in dynamic regulation of chromatin.  we propose that splicing regulators may actively modulate chromatin structure when recruited to their target rna sequences cotranscriptionally.  our analysis in three cell lines shows that, while both genomic and chromatin features can predict splicing to varying degrees, genomic features are the primary drivers of splicing, and the predictive power of chromatin features can largely be explained by their correlation with genomic features; chromatin features do not yield substantial independent contribution to splicing predictability.  histone ubiquitination predominately targets histones h2a and h2b.  we here show that ubr2 localizes to meiotic chromatin regions, including unsynapsed axial elements linked to chromatin inactivation, and mediates transcriptional silencing via the ubiquitination of histone h2a.  recent studies have revealed ubiquitin ligases involved in histone ubiquitination, yet the responsible enzymes and the function of histone ubiquitination in spermatogenesis remain unclear. ||| ",yes
Is there any research that relates the function of Notch Signaling with Alzheimer Disease?,"recent studies have reported that notch may be implicated in alzheimer's disease (ad) pathophysiology.  recent studies have identified notch signaling as a contributor of neurodegeneration including alzheimer's disease' (ad) pathophysiology.  aberrant notch signaling has recently emerged as a possible mechanism for the altered neurogenesis, cognitive impairment, and learning and memory deficits associated with alzheimer disease (ad).  these results indicate that altered expression of notch1 might be associated with the risk of alzheimer's disease.  a number of independent studies have shown significant increases of notch expression in brains from patients at later stages of sporadic alzheimer's disease (ad).  recently, notch receptors have been hypothesized to play a role in neurodegeneration and in particular in alzheimer's disease (notch1) and cadasil (notch3).  alzheimer's disease-related presenilins are thought to be involved in notch signaling during embryonic development and/or cellular differentiation.  notch signaling plays an instrumental role in hippocampus-dependent memory formation and recent evidence indicates a displacement of notch1 and a reduction its activity in hippocampal and cortical neurons from alzheimer's disease (ad) patients.  these data, together with immunohistochemical evidence of elevation of notch pathway expression in ad brain, suggest that notch dysregulation may contribute to the neuritic dystrophy characteristically seen in alzheimer's disease brain.  our results provide evidence of potentially important communications between the amyloid precursor protein and notch.  demonstration that cleavage of both app and notch are dependent on the product of the early onset alzheimer's disease gene, presenilin-1 (ps1), has raised the possibility that notch function may be altered in ad.  the specific roles of notch in progressive adulthood neurodegenerative disorders have begun to be unraveled in recent years.  we have previously reported the identification of notch2 as an amyloid precursor protein interacting protein in e18 rat neurons.  notch signaling plays a crucial role in adult brain function such as synaptic plasticity, memory and olfaction.  deficits in the notch pathway are involved in a number of neurologic diseases associated with mental retardation or/and dementia.  we report a functional relationship between amyloid precursor protein and notch1, which does not affect delta ligand binding.  this finding also suggests that notch may be affected by appgamma-secretase inhibitors under development for the treatment of alzheimer's disease, as these target ps1.  finally, we show that more notch intracellular domain is found in the nucleus in the presence of exogenous amyloid precursor protein or its intracellular domain, suggesting the mechanism by which the amyloid precursor protein affects notch signaling in certain cells.  however, the level of notch1 protein was significantly increased in human brain microvascular endothelial cells (hbmecs) after amyloid-beta treatment.  this study identifies notch as a central signaling cascade capable of modulating synaptic transmission in response to excitatory insult through the activation of neuroprotective genes that have been associated to ad. ||| ",yes
Is there any role for Pds5b in cohesion establishment?,"pds5p binds to the same chromosomal loci as the cohesin complex but plays a distinct role as a regulator of cohesion maintenance.  these data provide the first link between a protein required for cohesion, pds5p, and sumoylation, and suggest that pds5p sumoylation promotes the dissolution of cohesion.  however, pds5p and the cohesin complex likely have distinct roles in cohesion.  pds5 is required for sister chromatid cohesion, and somewhat paradoxically, to remove cohesin from chromosomes.  pds5p is a cohesin related protein.  thus, unlike the cohesin complex, which is required for cohesion establishment and maintenance, pds5p is required only for maintenance.  pds5 is an abundant heat-repeat-containing protein that binds to cohesin and mediates sister chromatid cohesion.  we found that pds5 plays a critical role during dna replication that is distinct from its previously known functions.  moreover, pds5b overexpression inhibited cell migration and invasion, while the downregulation of pds5b enhanced cell motility.  pds5b (precocious dissociation of sisters 5b) is involved in both tumorigenesis and cancer progression; however, the functions and molecular mechanisms of pds5b in pancreatic cancer (pc) are unknown.  pds5p and the cohesin complex are required for sister chromatid cohesion and localize to the same chromosomal loci over the same cell cycle window.  we report that pds5 mutants establish cohesion, but during mitosis exhibit precocious sister dissociation.  furthermore, reduced pds5b expression was associated with survival in pc patients.  the cohesin complex serves as the primary molecular glue responsible for cohesion.  pds5 interacts directly with wapl, to remove cohesin during mitosis.  surprisingly, top2 overexpression fails to suppress the cohesion defect of pds5 mutants, suggesting that it suppresses an additional and as yet uncharacterized defect in pds5 mutants that is essential for viability.  our results suggest that pds5p and top2p cooperate to promote proper chromosome segregation by a mechanism unrelated to either cohesion or catenation/decatenation.  moreover, the loss of pds5a/pds5b activated the sac in an atr-chk1-dependent manner and stabilized wapl on chromatin.  cell division cycle 5-like protein (cdc5l) is a core component of the putative e3 ubiquitin ligase complex containing prp19/pso4, plrg1 and spf27.  pds5b overexpression inhibited cell growth and induced apoptosis, whereas the inhibition of pds5b promoted growth of pc cells. ||| ",yes
Is there any role for long noncoding RNAs in adipogenesis?,"long noncoding rnas (lncrnas) play a major role in adipogenesis.  long noncoding rnas are crucial factors for modulating adipogenic differentiation, but only a few have been identified in humans.  emerging studies indicated that both long noncoding rnas and micro-rnas play crucial roles in the mediation of adipogenesis, which is closely linked to obesity-related diseases.  long noncoding rna (lncrna) is emerging as a vital regulator of adipogenesis.  long noncoding rnas (lncrnas) are emerging as powerful regulators of adipocyte differentiation and gene expression.  long noncoding rnas (lncrnas) have been implicated in a range of developmental processes and diseases, but the roles and mechanisms by which they act in adipogenic differentiation and adipose tissue biology are still unknown.  long noncoding rnas (lncrnas) have been discovered to play a key role in adipogenesis, while the role of lncrna human leukocyte antigen complex group 11 (hcg11) in adipocyte differentiation has not been studied clearly.  non-coding rnas are emerging as novel regulators in adipocyte differentiation and function.  together, our work provides a new mechanism by which long noncoding rna regulates adipogenic differentiation of human mscs and suggests that lyplal1-as1 may serve as a novel therapeutic target for preventing and combating diseases related to abnormal adipogenesis, such as obesity.  emerging evidence suggests that long noncoding rnas (lncrnas) play essential roles in the regulation of gene expression.  several studies have highlighted the relevance of micrornas in adipocyte differentiation, but the contributions of long non-coding rnas (lncrnas) are still largely uncharacterized.  it has been reported that some small noncoding rnas are involved in the regulation of insulin sensitivity.  here we identified a long non-coding rna called lnc-oad (lncrna associated with osteoblast and adipocyte differentiation, transcribed from 1700018a04rik gene), which modulated 3t3-l1 adipocyte differentiation.  circular rnas (circrnas) are a new class of non-coding transcripts generated across all eukaryotic tissues, but their function in adipose biology remains unknown.  potential regulators of adipogenesis include micrornas (mirnas), small non-coding rnas that have been recently shown related to adiposity and differentially expressed in fat depots.  in summary, these findings contribute to a better understanding of adipogenesis in relation to lncrnas and provide novel potential therapeutic targets for obesity-related metabolic diseases.  our results provide important evidence that circrnas serve as important regulators in adipocyte differentiation and metabolism.  many types of rnas, including messenger rnas (mrnas), long noncoding rnas (lncrnas) and circular rnas (circrnas), play crucial roles in regulating fat cell differentiation and tissue development.  long non-coding rnas (lncrnas) have gained extensive attentions due to their significant roles in diverse biological process.  however, whether long noncoding rnas also participate in the regulation of insulin sensitivity is still largely unknown. ||| ",yes
Is there any role of 5hmC in T-cell development and differentiation?,"5hmc plays important roles in regulation of gene expression and differentiation and has been implicated in t cell malignancies and autoimmunity.  underscoring their important function, 5hmc loci were highly enriched for genetic variants associated with t cell diseases and t-cell-specific chromosomal interactions.  further emphasizing the connection with gene expression, we find that 5hmc is enriched in active thymus-specific enhancers and that genes encoding key transcriptional regulators display high intragenic 5hmc levels in precursor cells at those developmental stages where they exert a positive effect.  our data constitute a valuable resource that will facilitate detailed analysis of the role of 5hmc in t-cell development and differentiation.  we have mapped 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmc) at different stages of t-cell development in the thymus and t-cell differentiation in the periphery.  specifically, 5hmc is involved in promoting gene expression, and this process is regulated by tet enzymes.  the epigenetic modification 5hmc has crucial roles in both cellular development and differentiation.  we found that 5hmc is enriched in enhancers as well as in gene bodies, suggesting a potential role for 5hmc in gene regulation.  here, we report early and widespread 5mc/5hmc remodeling during human cd4(+) t cell differentiation ex vivo at genes and cell-specific enhancers with known t cell function.  this decrease was accompanied by an increase in 5hmc levels in cell lines of hematopoietic origin.  our results support 5hmc-mediated dna de-methylation as a key component of cd4(+) t cell biology in humans, with important implications for gene regulation and lineage commitment.  5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmc) exists in dna, rna, and mitochondrial dna (mtdna) and plays an important role in many diseases.  5-hydroxymethyl-cytosine (5-hmc) is a form of modified cytosine, which has recently attracted a considerable attention due to its potential role in transcriptional regulation.  5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmc) was recently found to be abundantly present in certain cell types, including embryonic stem cells.  we show that 5hmc is enriched in the gene body of highly expressed genes at all developmental stages and that its presence correlates positively with gene expression.  our findings suggest that 5hmc may be targeted to certain genomic regions based both on gene expression and sequence composition.  5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmc) is a recently discovered base in the mammalian genome, produced upon oxidation of 5-methylcytosine (5mc) in a process catalyzed by tet proteins.  the molecular role of 5hmc in gene regulation, however, is not well understood.  thymosin fraction 5 and its component thymosin alpha 1 has been reported to play a regulatory role in the later stages of t lymphocyte differentiation.  importantly, genes prone to hypermethylation in cancer become depleted of 5hmc with tet deficiency, suggesting that tets normally promote 5hmc at these loci. ||| ",yes
Is there any role of Dlx1 and Dlx2 transcription factors in cortical interneurons?,"the postnatal functions of the dlx1&2 transcription factors in cortical interneurons (cins) are unknown.  we demonstrate preferential dlx1 expression in a subset of cortical and hippocampal interneurons which, in postnatal dlx1 mutants, show a time-dependent reduction in number.  dlx1, a member of the homeobox domain transcriptional factors, is expressed in a subset of interneurons and is involved in their differentiation.  our experimental data support the idea that dlx1 expression in developing interneurons specifically suppresses two important downstream regulators, leading to the characteristic morphology of dlx1-expressing interneurons with less branched dendrites and few dendritic spines.  vertebrate dlx genes have been implicated in the differentiation of multiple neuronal subtypes, including cortical gabaergic interneurons, and mutations in dlx genes have been linked to clinical conditions such as epilepsy and autism.  here, we demonstrate that dlx1/2 has a central role in restraining neurite growth of subpallial-derived immature interneurons at a stage when they migrate tangentially to cortex.  dlx homeodomain transcription factors are essential during embryonic development for the production of forebrain gabaergic interneurons.  here we show that dlx1 is also required for regulating the functional longevity of cortical and hippocampal interneurons in the adult brain.  the dlx transcription factors have a central role in controlling the development of gamma-aminobutyric acid (gaba)-ergic neurons in the forebrain.  dlx5 and dlx6 encode two homeobox transcription factors expressed by developing and mature gabaergic interneurons.  expression of the homeodomain-containing transcription factors dlx-1 and dlx-2 in the lateral (lge) and medial (mge) ganglionic eminences, subpallial embryonic structures, is required for generation of telencephalic interneurons.  we propose that dlx1/2 promote ob interneuron development mainly through activating the expression of sp8/9, which further promote tshz1 and prokr2 expression.  thus, dlx1&2 coordinate key components of cin postnatal development by promoting their excitability, inhibitory output, and survival.  our results identify another role for dlx genes as modulators of neuron versus oligodendrocyte development in the ventral embryonic forebrain.  to understand the roles of dlx1 in dendritic and postsynaptic differentiation, we manipulated dlx1 expression in both excitatory pyramidal neurons and inhibitory interneurons in hippocampal culture.  the widespread expression of dlx mrna and protein in the adult brain suggests that these genes may have additional roles in mature animals.  in dlx1-/-;dlx2+/- mutants, while the tangential migration of immature interneurons appears normal, they develop dendritic and axonal processes with increased length and decreased branching, and have deficits in their neocortical laminar positions.  cell transplantation analysis demonstrates that interneuron loss reflects cell-autonomous functions of dlx1.  in addition to its expression in the developing forebrain, dlx-1 is transcribed in several structures containing cells of neural crest origin such as the facial mesenchyme and various elements of the peripheral nervous system.  here, we show that the homeobox transcription factors dlx1/2 are central and essential components in the transcriptional code for generating ob interneurons. ||| ",yes
Is there any role of TBR1 in autism?,"it is therefore possible that tbr1 controls the expression of other autism risk factors.  disruptive mutations in the tbr1 gene have been repeatedly identified in patients with autism spectrum disorders (asds).  tbr1, a t-box transcription factor expressed in the cerebral cortex, regulates the expression of several candidate genes for autism spectrum disorders (asd).  t-brain-1 (tbr1), a causative gene in autism spectrum disorders (asds), encodes a brain-specific t-box transcription factor.  mutations in tbr1, a high-confidence asd (autism spectrum disorder)-risk gene encoding the transcriptional regulator tbr1, have been shown to induce diverse asd-related molecular, synaptic, neuronal, and behavioral dysfunctions in mice.  tbr1 +/- mice can serve as a suitable model for revealing how an autism causative gene controls neuronal circuits, neural activity, and autism-related behaviors.  among these 24 genes, four transcription factors auts2, nfia, nr4a2, and sox5 were found, suggesting that tbr1 controls a transcriptional cascade relevant to autism pathogenesis.  this report supports the role of tbr1 in id associated with autistic traits and suggests new structural brain malformations in humans.  our study suggests that tbr1 is important in the regulation of amygdalar axonal connections and cognition.  however, whether tbr1 mutations derived from autistic individuals cause similar dysfunctions in mice remains unclear.  these findings suggest that decreased levels of tgf-beta1 may be implicated in the pathophysiology of autism.  given the key role of transforming growth factor-beta1 (tgf-beta1) in brain development, we hypothesized that tgf-beta1 plays a role in the pathophysiology of autism.  our previous study demonstrated that tbr1, a causative gene of asd, controls axonal projection and neuronal activation of amygdala and regulates social interaction and vocal communication in a mouse model.  of 124 tbr1 target genes, 23 were reported to be associated with asds.  we conclude that tph2 may play a modest role in autism susceptibility, perhaps relating specifically to repetitive behaviors, pending replication of this result.  we report a possible association between autism in our sample and a recently described brain-expressed tryptophan hydroxylase gene (tph2).  in this study, we studied whether serum levels of tgf-beta1 are altered in patients with autism.  the downstream genes of tbr1 have been identified using microarray and promoter analyses.  the article reports two cases of childhood autism in tuberous sclerosis (ts).  here we report that btbr t(+)itpr3(tf)/j (btbr) mice, a model of idiopathic autism, have reduced spontaneous gabaergic neurotransmission. ||| ",yes
Is there any role of interleukin-11 in cardiovascular fibrosis?,"interleukin-11 (il-11) is an important inflammatory cytokine and has been demonstrated to participate in cardiovascular diseases.  the correlation of cardiac il-11 expression with biomarkers of renal fibrosis was assessed.  recent studies have demonstrated that il-11 also participates in cardiovascular diseases, including ischemia-reperfusion mediated heart injury and acute myocardial infarction.  interleukin-11 (il-11) is a cytokine that has been strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of fibrotic diseases and solid malignancies.  the present study is aimed at investigating whether il-11 levels are associated with the cardiac prognosis in patients with hf.  interleukin 11 (il11) is important for pulmonary fibroblast activation but the contribution of fibroblast-specific il11 activity to lung fibro-inflammation is not known.  in this study we examined il-11 expression levels in the heart and the kidney exposed to high blood pressure in renovascular hypertensive rats and their correlations to fibrotic markers and kidney injury.  in the human lung, il-11 upregulation has been associated with viral infections and a range of fibroinflammatory diseases, including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.  recent studies revealed its crucial role in the development of cardiovascular fibrosis.  the plasma concentrations of il-11 were measured in 240 patients with chronic hf (chf) and 80 control subjects without signs of significant heart disease.  higher plasma il-11 levels significantly increase the presence of cardiac events and suggest a poor outcome; although the diagnostic value of il-11 in chf is not as good as bnp, there is a certain value in predicting cardiac events in chf.  here, we summarize current literature surrounding the contribution of il-11 to the pathogenesis of autoimmune inflammatory diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, diabetes and systemic sclerosis, as well as other chronic inflammatory conditions such as periodontitis, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, psoriasis and colitis.  intriguingly, fibroblast-specific blockade of il-11 signaling has anti-inflammatory effects, which suggests that lung inflammation is sustained, in part, through il-11 activity in the stroma.  initially thought of as a protective cytokine, il-11 is now increasingly recognized as an important determinant of lung fibrosis, inflammation, and epithelial dysfunction.  the kaplan-meier analysis revealed that the patients with high il-11 concentrations had a higher risk of cardiac events compared with those with low il-11 concentrations.  the multivariate cox hazard analysis showed that the high plasma il-11 concentrations were independently associated with the presence of cardiac events after adjustment for confounding factors.  these data reveal a new function for il11 in pro-inflammatory lung fibroblasts and highlight the important contribution of the stroma to inflammation in pulmonary disease.  the il-11 was derived from aorta macrophages in tad.  there were also correlations of il-11 with tissue collagen expansion, number of activated fibroblasts and serum creatinine, but no correlation with mean arterial pressure.  il-11 was increased in thoracic aorta and plasma of tad patients and may be a promising biomarker for diagnosis in patients with tad. ||| ",yes
Is there any software for automated analysis of FISH images?,"the fluorescence image analyzer (flima) software was developed for the quantitative analysis of images generated by fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish).  automation of fish might increase the throughput and accuracy.  one solution would be software that works on a user's laptop or workstation that can access all image settings and provide quick and easy-to-use analysis of data.  we introduce lobster (little objects segmentation and tracking environment), an environment designed to help scientists design and customize image analysis workflows to accurately characterize biological objects from a broad range of fluorescence microscopy images, including large images exceeding workstation main memory.  there are some open-source image-based software analysis applications available.  using software for high-throughput cell image analysis offers researchers the possibility of performing comprehensive and precise analysis of a high number of images in an automated manner, making this routine task easier.  over the past few years, image analysis has emerged as a powerful tool for analyzing various cell biology parameters in an unprecedented and highly specific manner.  this software can be used for any type of image generated by a fluorescence microscope and is able to quantify digoxigenin probes exhibiting a red color, biotin probes exhibiting a green color, and double-fish probes (digoxigenin and biotin used together), where the white color is displayed.  increasingly automated techniques for arraying, immunostaining, and imaging tissue sections led us to design software for convenient management, display, and scoring.  lobster comes with a starting set of over 75 sample image analysis workflows and associated images stemming from state-of-the-art image-based research projects.  currently, the images of fish are examined without a coefficient that enables a comparison between them.  the software is implemented on a general-purpose, commercially available image analyzer (magiscan 2) using tv input from a conventional research microscope with minimal modification.  the fish oracle application and an installed demo web server are available at http://www.zbh.uni-hamburg.de/fishoracle.  based on unique image processing algorithms, this user-friendly object-oriented software package runs on multiple platforms, including unix, ms-windows 95 and nt, and power macintosh.  by setting previously defined parameters, the software can automatically analyze a large number of images without the supervision of the researcher.  open source software such as imagej and cellprofiler greatly simplified the quantitative analysis of microscopy images but their applicability is limited by the size, dimensionality and complexity of the images under study.  lobster requires matlab (version ≥ 2015a), matlab image processing toolbox, and matlab statistics and machine learning toolbox.  however, few of the current freely-available bioimage analysis software tools are optimized for efficient handling of these images.  automation of her2 fish analysis in oesophageal cancer has not been performed before.  fish oracle offers a fast and easy to use visualization tool for array cgh and snp array data. ||| ",yes
Is there any software for automated analysis of immuno-histochemistry images?,"automation in histopathology is an attractive concept and recent advances in the application of computerized expert systems and machine vision have made automated image analysis of histological images possible.  computerized image analysis for whole-slide images has been shown to improve efficiency, accuracy, and consistency in histopathology evaluations.  using software for high-throughput cell image analysis offers researchers the possibility of performing comprehensive and precise analysis of a high number of images in an automated manner, making this routine task easier.  to minimize critical aspects of manual quantitative data acquisition, we generated semi-automated image-processing steps for the quantification of individual stained cells with immunohistochemical staining of different subcellular location.  systems capable of complete automation not only require the ability to segment tissue features and grade histological abnormalities, but, must also be capable of locating diagnostically useful areas from within complex histological scenes.  recent technological advances like highly efficient automated whole slide digitizer (scanner) systems, innovative ia platforms, and the emergence of pathologist-friendly image annotation and analysis systems mean that quantification of features on histological digital images will become increasingly prominent in pathologists' daily professional lives.  increasingly automated techniques for arraying, immunostaining, and imaging tissue sections led us to design software for convenient management, display, and scoring.  the identification of diagnostically useful fields advances the potential of automated systems in histopathology: these regions could than be scrutinized at high power using knowledge-guided image segmentation for disease grading.  the aim of this study was to test and validate the underlying image analysis algorithm with respect to user friendliness, accuracy, and transferability to different histologic scenarios.  in order to evaluate the correlation between immunohistochemical and morphometric data on the same histological sections, we have developed a flexible color image analyzer (microcomputer-assisted picture processing system type ii, mapps-ii), and established an effective method to analyze the immunostained colorectal neoplasms based on the color recognition theory of human visual system.  there are several commercially available software packages that allow image analysis; however, these can be complex, require relatively high level of computer skills, and can be expensive.  one solution would be software that works on a user's laptop or workstation that can access all image settings and provide quick and easy-to-use analysis of data.  the increasing demand for immunohistochemistry for clinical diagnostics, in combination with an ongoing shortage of staff in the histology laboratory, has brought about a need for automation in immunohistochemistry.  therefore, it is suitable for the fast and efficient analysis of high numbers of fully digitalized histologic sections, potentially allowing ""high-throughput"" quantitative ""histomic"" analysis.  digital pathology enables computational analysis algorithms to be applied at scale to histological images.  to review how technology has been applied to automating the process of immunohistochemical staining.  digital immunohistochemistry (ihc) is one of the most promising applications brought by new generation image analysis (ia).  embedded in reliable automated systems, ia could help pathologists in their daily work and thus contribute to more accurate determination of prognostic histological factors on whole slide images.  quantitative analysis of histologic slides is of importance for pathology and also to address surgical questions.  we reviewed strategies for acquiring, collating, and storing histological images with the goal of streamlining subsequent data analyses. ||| ",yes
Is there any tool that facilitates the functional analysis of cis-regulatory regions in zebrafish?,"here we provide, for the first time to our knowledge, a comprehensive list of developmentally regulated zebrafish genes and their expression profiles during embryogenesis, including novel information on the temporal expression of several thousand previously uncharacterized genes.  to exploit fully the power of the zebrafish system as a model for vertebrate development, it will be necessary to develop efficient tools for genomic analysis.  the zebrafish has recently emerged as a useful system for understanding vertebrate developmental genetics, despite the lack of a linkage map.  the zebrafish is widely used for functional studies of vertebrate genes.  this approach can be used for the functional analysis of the late role of developmental genes in the neural tube of zebrafish embryo and larvae.  here we have employed microarray analysis to study the temporal activity of developmentally regulated genes during zebrafish embryogenesis.  the technique described offers a guide that will provide innovative and broad opportunities to beginner students and researchers who are interested in the functional analysis of neuronal activity, plasticity, and neural development in the zebrafish brain.  despite the extensive use of zebrafish as a model organism in developmental biology and regeneration research, genetic techniques enabling conditional analysis of gene function are limited.  the zebrafish is a powerful model vertebrate amenable to high throughput in vivo genetic analyses.  the rapid development of zebrafish embryos provides opportunities for investigation of genes essential for developmental processes, the human counterparts of which might be implicated in diseases.  zebrafish (danio rerio) is a well-recognized model for the study of vertebrate developmental genetics, yet at the same time little is known about the transcriptional events that underlie zebrafish embryogenesis.  this brief review summarizes features of the zebrafish, danio rerio, that make it a suitable model organism for studies of regulatory physiology.  such methodologies promise to enable new zebrafish models for interrogating human physiology and disease.  here, we provide detailed protocols for proteomics in zebrafish from sample preparation to mass spectrometry (ms), including a comparison of databases for ms identification of zebrafish proteins.  finally, the review provides examples of functional studies in zebrafish, including studies in sensory neurons, cardiac rhythm disturbances, gastrointestinal function, and studies of the developing kidney, that illustrate potential applications.  to facilitate analysis of the zebrafish genome, genetic maps have been constructed and sequence annotation of a reference zebrafish genome is ongoing.  zebrafish (d. rerio) has become a powerful and widely used model system for the analysis of vertebrate embryogenesis and organ development.  the zebrafish has emerged as a new model system in behavioral neurobiology research.  because of the relative ease with which combinatorial studies can be performed, the zebrafish may eventually be particularly valuable in understanding the functional interaction between subtle gene defects that cause polygenic disorders.  analysis of the zebrafish allows one to combine two distinct scientific approaches, comparative ethology and neurobehavioral genetics. ||| ",yes
Is there association of matrix metalloproteinases with behaviour of pituitary adenomas?,"data on the dural invasiveness of pituitary adenomas have been correlated to the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (e.g.  to investigate the expression levels of matrix metalloproteinases-9 (mmp-9) and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (timp-1) in pituitary adenomas (pas), and to analyze the relationship of the expressions of the two with the prognosis of patients.  to explore the correlation of matrix metalloproteinase-1 (mmp(1)) and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (timp(1)) with pituitary adenoma fibrosis.  twenty-two pituitary adenomas were examined on the secretion of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (mmp-9) and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (timp-1) using a cell immunoblot assay, and discussed regarding an association between cavernous sinus invasion and the secretion of these proteins.  the aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between expression of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (mmp-2) and cavernous sinus invasion in pituitary adenoma.  the interrelationship between mmps and serine proteinases in pituitary adenomas remains to be elucidated.  we analyzed mmp-9 expression using mrna and protein level determinations and explored the possibility that matrix metalloproteinase-9 (mmp-9) is a potential biological marker of pituitary adenoma invasiveness and whether mmp-9 could be used to discriminate the extent of invasiveness among different hormonal subtypes, tumor sizes, growth characteristics, and primary versus recurrent tumors.  tissue samples from 54 pituitary adenomas were examined for expression of mmp-2 protein by immunohistochemistry.  in pituitary adenomas, reactions were positive (diffuse expression) to mmp-2 (74% of cases), mmp-9 (49%), timp-2 (88%), upa (89%), upar (90%), tpa (69%), and pai-1 (87%).  matrix metalloproteinases (mmps) are involved in remodeling processes and have been immunocytochemically localized in some endocrine glands and their tumors.  this study suggests that mmp-2 may be associated with aggressiveness and invasion in pituitary adenoma but is not related to tumor size or secretory function.  in this study, paraffin-embedded material from 84 human pituitary adenomas (acromegaly n=18, cushing's disease n=21, prolactinoma n=18, thyroid-stimulating hormone-secreting adenoma n=1, nonsecreting adenoma n=26) and 9 nontumourous anterior pituitary lobes (obtained from patients with prostate cancer) was immunohistochemically analysed for expression of mmp-2, mmp-9, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-2 (timp-2), urokinase-type plasminogen activator (upa), upa receptor (upar), tissue-type plasminogen activator (tpa), plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (pai-1), and interleukin-6 (il-6).  using anterior pituitary gland and pituitary adenomas, immunocytochemical localization of mmp-2 (gelatinase-a), -9 (gelatinase-b), tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (timp)-1 and -2 was performed.  matrix metalloproteinase-9 (mmp-9), pituitary tumor transforming gene (pttg), and high mobility group a 2 (hmga2) play important roles in the tumorigenesis of adrenocorticotrophic hormone (acth)-secreting pituitary tumors, but their associations with tumor recurrence after transsphenoidal adenomectomy remain unclear.  in this study, the relationship between pituitary adenoma invasion and the changes in mmp-8 and timp-1 expressions is analyzed.  the occurrence and development of these type of tumors is closely related with matrix metalloproteinases (mmps) and endogenous specific tissue inhibitor of mmps (timps).  immunohistochemistry was performed to identify the presence and localization of mmp-9 in pituitary adenomas.  in order to investigate some characteristic features of pituitary adenomas which invade the cavernous sinus, we examined immunohistological studies for mmp-9 in seven pituitary adenomas for type iv collagen in a dura mater and assayed for type iv collagenase activity in seven adenomas using type iv collagen labelled with fluorescein isothiocyaniate (fitc).  to analyze the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (mmps) and their relationships with the histological grades of the intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (ipmn) of the pancreas, we examined the frequency of expression and intracellular localization of mmp1, mmp2, mmp3, mmp7, and mmp9 in ipmn by immunohistochemistry.  the aim of this study was to detect a potential association between clinicopathological factors of prostate cancer aggressiveness and the expression of matrix metalloproteases and their inhibitors in tumour and stromal cells. ||| ",yes
Is there evidence for de novo genesis of enhancers in vertebrates?,"here we show evidence for the de novo genesis of enhancers in vertebrates.  to examine the contributions of sequence and function conservation in the evolution of enhancers, we systematically identified enhancers whose sequences are not conserved among distant groups of vertebrate species, but have homologous function and are likely to be derived from a common ancestral sequence.  these results demonstrate that these enhancers have been de novo generated in fish.  while a growing body of evidence demonstrates that such innovation is generated by functional changes or translocation of regulatory elements via mobile genetic elements, the de novo generation of enhancers from non-regulatory/non-mobile sequences has, to our knowledge, not previously been demonstrated.  we infer the phylogenetic origins of these enhancers and find that ∼20% arose in the mammalian stem lineage, coincident with the emergence of the neocortex.  vertebrate enhancers are often very highly conserved in their sequences, and relative positions, across distantly related taxa.  these results show that current models depicting cross species enhancer function as dependent on conserved binding sites can be overly simplistic, with sound evolutionary inference requiring detailed dissection of underlying mechanisms.  these results indicate that selection on function, rather than sequence, may be a common mode of enhancer evolution; evidence for selection at the sequence level is not a necessary criterion to define a gene regulatory element.  we propose that the different degree of conservation seen in vertebrate and drosophila enhancers may be explained solely by differences in their population sizes and generation times.  by revealing that minor changes in non-regulatory sequences are sufficient to generate new enhancers, our study highlights an important playground for creating new regulatory variability and evolutionary innovation.  comparisons between diverse vertebrate genomes have uncovered thousands of highly conserved non-coding sequences, an increasing number of which have been shown to function as enhancers during early development.  our approach combined comparative genomics and epigenomics to identify potential enhancer sequences in the genomes of three groups of distantly related vertebrate species.  based on these observations, we present a model of the enhancer life cycle in which neocortical enhancers initially emerge from genomic background as short, weakly constrained ""proto-enhancers.""  large-scale gene amplifications may have facilitated the evolution of morphological innovations that accompanied the origin of vertebrates.  we have identified numerous potential enhancers with divergent sequences but a conserved function.  enhancers regulate precise spatial and temporal patterns of gene expression in eukaryotes and, moreover, evolutionary changes in these modular cis-regulatory elements may represent the predominant genetic basis for phenotypic evolution.  the nucleotide sequence of the early enhancer region is extremely conserved among mammalian clades, with five previously described cis-acting elements, a-e, being invariant.  vertebrate genomes share numerous conserved non-coding elements, many of which function as enhancer elements and are hypothesised to be under evolutionary constraint due to a need to be bound by combinations of sequence-specific transcription factors.  the origin of vertebrate embryogenesis must have involved the evolution of new regulatory pathways to control the development of new features, but how did this occur?  nevertheless, we show that at least 31% of the redundant enhancer pairs in the human genome (and 17% in the mouse genome) indeed originated in this manner. ||| ",yes
Is there evidence for somatic mosaicism in Tuberous Sclerosis?,"- remarkably, superimposed mosaicism appears to occur in tuberous sclerosis far more frequently than simple segmental mosaicism.  we describe 2 patients with such a presentation and hypothesize that this is a mosaic form of tuberous sclerosis.  in patients with tuberous sclerosis, we can today distinguish between two different categories of segmental mosaicism.  mosaicism for tuberous sclerosis complex mutations has been documented, complicating provision of genetic counseling to families.  tuberous sclerosis (ts) is a rare genetic disorder of autosomal-dominant inheritance.  this case supports the hypothesis that the cerebral lesions in tuberous sclerosis are secondary to a defect in neuronal maturation and migration.  there have been numerous case reports of various abnormalities of neuronal migration associated with tuberous sclerosis.  numerous pathogenic mutations have been elucidated in individuals affected with tuberous sclerosis complex.  tuberous sclerosis (ts) is a relatively rare, autosomal dominant syndrome that displays high genetic penetrance in affected families.  in order to render physicians familiar with the manifold manifestations of this category as noted in tuberous sclerosis, we review the following clinical designations under which cases suggesting superimposed mosaicism have been published: forehead plaque; shagreen patch; fibrous cephalic plaque; fibromatous lesion of the scalp; folliculocystic and collagen hamartoma; segmental hypomelanosis; congenital segmental lymphedema; and segmental 'diffuse' lipomatosis.  a growing body of evidence implicates a defect of cell maturation and migration in the pathogenesis of many of the lesions in tuberous sclerosis affecting the central nervous system.  similar pathways might contribute to aberrant neuronal differentiation and migration in tuberous sclerosis complex.  tuberous sclerosis complex presents diverse clinical characteristics, and either of tsc1 and tsc2 genes shows a wide range of mutations in their coding regions.  tuberous sclerosis has many forms of clinical presentation.  tuberous sclerosis complex is an autosomal dominant disorder in which the manifestations can include seizures; mental retardation; autism; benign tumors of the brain, retina, skin, and kidneys; and pulmonary lymphangiomyomatosis.  tuberous sclerosis complex is a rare autosomal dominant disorder caused by mutations in either of tsc1 and tsc2 genes.  tuberous sclerosis is a multisystem disorder that is transmitted in an autosomal dominant fashion.  tuberous sclerosis complex (tsc) is an autosomal dominant neurocutaneous syndrome caused by either tsc1 or tsc2 gene mutations.  tuberous sclerosis complex is an autosomal dominant disease of benign tumors occurring in multiple organ systems of the body.  we describe the clinical characteristics of a chinese family with tsc1 gene mutation and present a literature review of chinese patients with tuberous sclerosis complex gene mutation reported since 2004. ||| ",yes
Is there evidence that tomato juice lowers cholesterol levels?,"the consumption of tomato juice led to a reduction in total cholesterol levels (l: 157.6 v. 153.2 mg/dl, p = 0.008; lc: 153.4 v. 147.4 mg/dl, p = 0.002) and that of crp (l: 315.6 v. 262.3 microg/l, p = 0.017; lc: 319.2 v. 247.1 microg/l, p = 0.001) in both groups.  in the present study, we examined whether supplementation with tomato-juice has any implication on the risk status of patients with metabolic syndrome.  in conclusion, tomato juice may have favorable effects on lipid metabolism, but polyphenol fortification does not constitute additional beneficial cardiovascular effects.  a novel functional tomato sauce from vine-ripened tomatoes compares favourably with a commercialised sterol-enriched yogurt in term of absolute ldl-cholesterol change.  the results of the present study suggest an alleviating effect of tomato-juice with regard to risk factors associated with metabolic syndrome.  epidemiologic evidence suggests that tomato-based products could reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases.  epidemiological studies suggest that consumption of tomato products reduces the risk of cvd via antioxidant, hypocholesterolaemic and anti-inflammatory mechanisms.  raw tomato consumption produced a favorable effect on hdl-c levels in overweight women.  no significant differences were observed in the plasmatic parameters, except that hdl-cholesterol increased significantly after consumption of both tomato juices.  intake of a tomato sauce with a high carotenoid content may support treatment of patients affected by common hypercholesterolemia.  epidemiological evidence indicates that high consumption of tomatoes and tomato-based products reduces the risk of chronic diseases such as cvd and cancer.  the available evidence on the effects of tomato products and lycopene supplementation on cv risk factors supports the view that increasing the intake of these has positive effects on blood lipids, blood pressure and endothelial function.  epidemiological data have shown a link between dietary intake of tomatoes and tomato products (rich in carotenoids) and a decreased risk of chronic diseases.  overall, interventions supplementing tomato were associated with significant reductions in ldl-cholesterol (-0.22 mmol/l; p = 0.006), il-6 (standardised mean difference -0.25; p = 0.03), and improvements in fmd (2.53%; p = 0.01); while lycopene supplementation reduced systolic-bp (-5.66 mmhg; p = 0.002).  epidemiological evidence suggests an association between consumption of tomato products or lycopene and lower risk for cardiovascular diseases (cvd).  we found a greater ldl-cholesterol reduction in the participants with a basal ldl-cholesterol more than 152 mg/dl (15% for sterol-enriched yogurt and 12% for tomato sauce at high adherence).  we compared the effects of polyphenol-enriched and standard tomato juice on parameters of lipid and oxidative status and blood pressure in subjects with stage 1 hypertension.  a significant difference in ldl-cholesterol change was found between participants taking yogurt, tomato sauce (high adherence) and tomato sauce (low adherence) (- 16; - 12; + 8 mg/dl respectively; p < 0.001).  the aim of this study was to compare the lipid-lowering effect of a novel functional tomato sauce with a well-known functional food with a lipid-lowering effect, i.e.  there was a significant improvement in the inflammation status and the endothelial dysfunction of the tomato-juice supplemented patients. ||| ",yes
Is there evidence to suggest that triiodothyronine has neuroprotective properties in traumatic brain injury?,"here we found that treatment with triiodothyronine (t3) ameliorated the progression of neurological deficits in mice subjected to tbi.  thyroid hormone plays an important role in brain development and adult brain function, and may influence neuronal recovery after traumatic brain injury (tbi).  thyroid hormone (th) plays a crucial role in neurodevelopment, but its function and specific mechanisms remain unclear after traumatic brain injury (tbi).  thyrotropin-releasing hormone (trh) and some of its stable analogues have recently been shown to improve functional recovery after neurologic dysfunctions, such as brain trauma and epilepsy, in both animals and humans.  the findings from both in vitro and in vivo studies support a role of thyroid hormone in activating pathways important for neuronal protection and promotion of neuronal recovery after injury.  however, in traumatic brain injury (tbi), it is unclear whether a beneficial effect of tetrahydrocurcumin exists.  we have previously demonstrated that thyroid hormone (t3; 3,3',5-triiodo-l-thyronine) possesses neuroprotective and anti-edema activity in pre-stroke treatment regimens when administered as a solution or as a nanoparticle formulation.  we hypothesize that a deiodinase ii (d2) inhibitor reverse triiodothyronine (rt3) may render brain specific hypometabolic state to ensue reduced damage during an acute phase of cerebral ischemia without affecting circulating thyroid hormone levels.  thyroid hormone (t3) has been shown to protect against ischemic damage in middle cerebral artery occlusion (mcao) model of ischemic brain stroke.  our studies provide evidence to stimulate clinical development of thyroid hormones for use in ischemic brain stroke.  triiodothyronine (t3), successfully used as therapeutic agent in euthyroid depressive states, has been found to exert an antidepressant-like effect in various psychopharmacological tests in rodents.  in this study, we hypothesized that administration of tetrahydrocurcumin provides neuroprotection in a rat model of tbi.  these findings reveal new roles and mechanisms of triiodothyronine in the cardioprotection against i/r injury.  in extra-hypothalamic regions in vitro, we have shown trh to have a protective effect against synaptic loss and neuronal apoptosis.  triiodothyronine (t3), the biologically active form of thyroid hormone, was reported to protect myocardium from ischemia/reperfusion (i/r) injury when given before sustained ischemia, but its cardioprotective effects when given at the onset of reperfusion (postconditioning), a protocol with more clinical impact is unknown.  recent studies have provided evidence that triiodothyronine (t3) might play an effective role in the recovery of ischemic myocardium, through the preservation of mitochondrial function and the improvement of energy substrate metabolism.  a single dose of levothyroxine (t4), one hour after injury, increased serum t4 and normalized serum t3 levels.  pre-clinical animal studies have shown that triiodothyronine (t3) replacement therapy improves cardiac contractile function after myocardial infarction (mi).  rt3 administration in rats significantly reduced neuronal injury markers, infarct size and neurological deficit upon ischemic insult.  further, we tested t2 (3,5-diiodo-l-thyronine) a natural deiodination metabolite of t3 in mcao model of brain stroke. ||| ",yes
Is there increased incidence of incontinence in athletes?,"current evidence points to a high prevalence of urinary incontinence among female athletes.  there is an even higher rate of athletic incontinence (34.15%) among high school female athletes surveyed in this study than in previous studies of college age athletes.  urinary incontinence prevalence was 28% for athletes and 9.8% for control subjects (p = .001).  there is a very high prevalence of urinary incontinence in women athletes.  the more seasons athletes are engaged in vigorous exercise, the higher the rate of incontinence in athletics as well as during laughter and activities of daily living (adls).  therefore, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the prevalence of urinary incontinence in female young athletes.  athletic incontinence is common among adolescent female athletes.  looking at the different sports activities, a higher rate of incontinence was found in women participating in basketball (16.6%), athletics (15%), and tennis or squash (11%).  to evaluate the prevalence of urinary incontinence (ui) in female athletes practising high-impact sports and its association with knowledge, attitude and practice (kap).  a collection of studies have demonstrated that approximately one-third of female nulliparous athletes experience urinary incontinence during their athletic activities.  incontinent athletes demonstrated a relative risk of 2.7 to develop sexual desire problem when compared to the continents (p = 0.04; 95% cis: 1.50-4.89).  the present authors observed a relationship between the sport and the pelvic floor dysfunction, in particular urinary incontinence.  research has demonstrated that young female athletes participating in high-impact sports may be at higher risk for urinary incontinence.  to determine the prevalence of urinary incontinence (ui) among elite athletes and to compare prevalences between sexes and across different sports modalities.  eating disorders also increase the risk of urinary incontinence in athletes.  stress urinary incontinence is common during physical activity.  in a total of 105 athletes, the present authors observed that 65.7% had reported at least one symptom of stress urinary incontinence (sui) and/or urgency, during sport or in daily life situations.  the purpose of this pilot study was to describe the urinary habits and frequency of incontinence among adolescent female athletes.  contributing factors of incontinence that have thus far been the focus of study include type of sport, duration and intensity of athletic activity, use of hormonal contraception, and weight.  a high number of female athletes suffer from pfd, especially urinary incontinence. ||| ",yes
Is there increased recombination rate in human regulatory domains?,"mutational sites and chromosomal rearrangements that enhance or suppress recombination frequency in specific regions are known, but general mechanisms that enhance recombination have not yet been discovered.  human recombination rates vary along the chromosomes as well as between the two sexes.  homologous recombination is increased during meiosis between dna sequences at the same chromosomal position (allelic recombination) and at different chromosomal positions (ectopic recombination).  there is growing evidence that epigenetic factors may have an important influence on recombination rates, as well as on crossover position.  in higher organisms the rate of recombination between genetic loci is presumably responsive to selective pressure.  novel findings over the last 2 years have led to an increased emphasis on homologous recombination (hr) as both a pathway for dna repair and a cause for genomic rearrangements.  using both public database analysis and wet-bench approaches, we revisited the relationship between increased rates of meiotic recombination and genome imprinting.  there is also an excess of hot-spots of recombination at imprinted regions, and this is likely to do with the presence of imprinted genes, per se.  we tested whether dinucleotide repeats sequences are preferential sites for recombination because of their high affinity for recombination enzymes.  in this strain, rec-1, the number of reciprocal recombination events between linked loci is increased.  besides the obvious possibility of retrotransposition, gene rearrangements may be induced by sequences that stimulate genetic recombination.  several dna sequence elements are thought to stimulate homologous recombination, illegitimate recombination, or both in mammalian cells.  ectopic recombination between locally repeated dna sequences is of fundamental importance in the evolution of gene families, generating copy-number variation in human dna and often leading to pathological rearrangements.  recently, selective pressures and mutational events that influence recombination have been reviewed.  several lines of evidence suggest that reiterated sequences in the human genome are targets for nonallelic homologous recombination (nahr), which facilitates genomic rearrangements.  the past few years have seen an explosion of interest in understanding the role of regulatory dna.  crossing over in ectopic recombination, resulting in chromosomal rearrangements, was associated with 35-60% of recombination events and was stimulated 12-fold by m26.  recombination hotspots are important elements in controlling meiotic allelic recombination.  taken together, these findings support the involvement of a combination of specific dna sequences and epigenetic factors as major determinants of hot-spots of recombination at imprinted chromosomal regions.  when the dna in the ccc form is integrated into the e. coli genome by homologous recombination to form a directly repeated structure, a striking enhancement of excisional recombination between the repeats occurs. ||| ",no
Is thrombophilia related to increased risk of miscarriage?,"both acquired and inherited thrombophilia is associated with an increased risk of pregnancy failure (i.e.  at present it seems that thrombophilia are associated with and may even cause some cases of pregnancy loss.  heritable thrombophilia is associated with an increased risk for pregnancy failure, defined as sporadic and recurrent miscarriage, late fetal loss, and other vascular pregnancy complications such as preeclampsia and intrauterine growth retardation.  this review discusses the evidence of association between thrombophilias and pregnancy outcome together with issues as to clinical management and preventive strategies.  women with recurrent fetal miscarriages have an increased incidence of thrombophilia.  inherited thrombophilias are the leading cause of maternal thromboembolism and are associated with an increased risk of recurrent spontaneous abortion (second- and third-trimester fetal loss).  the role of heritable thrombophilia in pregnancy failure is reviewed, with a focus on recurrent miscarriage, in terms of epidemiology, etiology, and potential therapeutic implications.  there is a growing view that inherited or acquired thrombophilia may predispose a woman towards an adverse pregnancy outcome.  inherited thrombophilia is associated with both poor obstetrical outcomes and increased cardiovascular risk later in life.  is there an association between hereditary thrombophilia in pregnant women and risk of recurrent pregnancy loss (rpl)?  both acquired and inherited thrombophilias are associated with an increased risk of pregnancy-related venous thromboembolism (vte) as well as with adverse pregnancy outcome.  the role of acquired thrombophilia has been accepted as an etiology of recurrent miscarriage (rm); however, the contribution of specific inherited thrombophilic genes to this disorder has remained controversial.  inherited and acquired thrombophilia are associated with recurrent pregnancy loss.  genetic thrombophilias may be one of the major etiological factors for recurrent abortion and fetal demise.  our purpose was to examine whether genetic thrombophilias are etiological factors for recurrent fetal miscarriage or not.  over the last decade, inherited thrombophilia is often referred as a possible cause of recurrent miscarriages and in vitro fertilisation (ivf) failure.  inherited and acquired thrombophilia have been found to be associated with recurrent pregnancy loss.  this finding suggests a possible association between this thrombophilic condition and early reproductive failures.  the genes involved in thrombophilia could be one reason for fertility complications in some women with unexplained infertility.  factor v leiden (fvl) and prothrombin g20210a (fiig20210a) mutations are associated with a higher risk of miscarriage: we sought to understand whether this association differs by clinical time of unexplained miscarriage, and by ethnic origin, among women with no previous thrombotic episode, during the first intended pregnancy. ||| ",yes
Is thyroid hormone therapy indicated in patients with heart failure?,"accordingly, thyroid hormone or a thyroid hormone analogue that improves cardiac performance might be useful in the treatment of heart failure and has been studied.  we designed a randomized controlled trial to compare the efficacy and safety of thyroid hormone supplementation in patients with chronic heart failure complicated with subclinical hypothyroidism.  thyroid hormone level abnormalities commonly exist in severe heart failure and may be of prognostic value.  american college of cardiology/american heart association guidelines for the diagnosis and management of heart failure recommend investigating exacerbating conditions such as thyroid dysfunction, but without specifying the impact of different thyroid-stimulation hormone (tsh) levels.  thyroheart-chf is designed as a prospective, multi-center, randomized, controlled clinical trial to study the efficacy and safety of thyroid hormone supplementation in patients with chronic heart failure complicated with subclinical hypothyroidism.  thyroid dysfunction is prevalent in patients with heart failure (hf) and hypothyroidism is related to the adverse prognosis of hf subjects receiving cardiac resynchronization therapy (crt).  thus, triiodothyronine or a thyroid hormone analogue may be a useful adjunct to other measures in the treatment of heart failure.  therapeutic and prognostic implications of subclinical thyroid dysfunction in patients with heart failure (hf) are unclear.  animal and human studies have also demonstrated many benefits from thyroid hormone treatment of heart diseases, particularly heart failure.  there are well-documented changes in thyroid hormone metabolism that accompany heart failure (hf).  thyroid dysfunction is known to effect cardiac function and is a risk factor for developing heart failure (hf).  though thyroid hormone abnormalities have been identified in many cardiac conditions, the role of thyroid hormones in congestive heart failure has not been well defined.  heart failure is a major health problem and its relationship to thyroid dysfunction has been increasingly investigated in recent years.  thus, the purpose of this review was to discuss changes in thyroid hormone economy with special emphasis on thyroid hormone metabolism in models of heart failure.  the therapeutic potential of using thyroid hormone for cardiogenic shock resulting from progressive heart failure has not been previously delineated.  subclinical hypothyroidism is a common condition in patients with heart failure and is defined as elevated serum thyroid hormone (tsh) with normal circulating free thyroxine (ft4).  the heart is a major target of thyroid hormones, with maintenance of euthyroid hormone balance critical for proper function.  thyroid hormone (th) is critical for cardiac development and heart function.  thyroid-stimulating hormone (tsh) suppressive therapy with levothyroxine (l-t4) may cause adverse cardiac effects such as rhythm disturbances and ventricular hypertrophy.  this review will first discuss the clinical evidence for the use of thyroid hormones as a cardioprotective agent and then provide an overview of the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying beneficial changes from thyroid hormone treatment of heart diseases. ||| ",no
Is tirilazad effective for treatment of aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage?,"in patients with ct-proven subarachnoid haemorrhage, presumably caused by a ruptured aneurysm, ultra-early, short-term tranexamic acid treatment did not improve clinical outcome at 6 months, as measured by the modified rankin scale.  to assess the efficacy and safety of tirilazad in patients with aneurysmal sah.  in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage, short-term antifibrinolytic therapy with tranexamic acid has been shown to reduce the risk of rebleeding.  the management of patients with subarachnoid haemorrhage following rupture of an intracranial aneurysm is changing.  to test whether treatment with tirilazad would reduce ischemic symptoms from vasospasm and improve overall outcome in patients with ruptured aneurysms, a prospective randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled trial was conducted at 41 neurosurgical centers in europe, australia, and new zealand.  tirilazad mesylate, a nonglucocorticoid 21-aminosteroid, has been shown in experimental models to reduce vasospasm following subarachnoid hemorrhage (sah) and to reduce infarct size from focal cerebral ischemia.  a phase 1/2a double-blinded randomized controlled trial (2:1 randomization) to assess the safety of a 7-day intravenous infusion of tirofiban compared with placebo, in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage treated with ventriculostomy placed in the operative room and coiling was conducted.  a database of patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage was analyzed who were confirmed by ct, and underwent endovascular treatment between january 2005 and january 2012,.  background the isat (international subarachnoid aneurysm trial) has generated a paradigm shift towards endovascular treatment for intracranial aneurysms but remains unclear if this has led to a true reduction in the risk for aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (asah).  timing of treatment of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage has been controversial.  a prospective series of 30 patients with a single, angiographically verified aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (sah) was studied for the effect of intrathecal thrombolytic therapy with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-pa) on outcome, angiographic vasospasm, and computerized tomography (ct) findings after surgery.  endovascular treatment of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage which was confirmed by ct within 72 hours achieved better outcomes than that confirmed after 72 hours, especially in those patients treated within 24 hours of onset in comparison with patients treated between 4 and 10 days.  the aim of this survey was to evaluate the current provision of peri-operative care for patients with an aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage in the united kingdom and republic of ireland.  this retrospective study was designed to access the safety and efficacy among cohorts of different timing of endovascular treatment patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage.  in this multicentre prospective, randomised, controlled, open-label trial with masked outcome assessment, adult patients with spontaneous ct-proven subarachnoid haemorrhage in eight treatment centres and 16 referring hospitals in the netherlands were randomly assigned to treatment with tranexamic acid in addition to care as usual (tranexamic acid group) or care as usual only (control group).  aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage (asah) is associated with significant morbidity and mortality.  aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (sah) with associated intracerebral hemorrhage (ich) is often treated with concomitant surgical clipping and ich evacuation.  these observations suggest that tirilazad mesylate, at a dosage of 6 mg/kg per day, is safe and improves overall outcome in patients (especially in men) who have experienced an aneurysmal sah.  subarachnoid haemorrhage is a fairly common condition and a neurosurgical emergency.  the presumed effectiveness of induced hypertension for treating delayed cerebral ischemia after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage is based on uncontrolled case-series only. ||| ",no
Is transcapillary  albumin escape altered in diabetic patients?,"diabetic patients with elevated urinary albumin excretion rate (incipient or clinical nephropathy) also have an increased transcapillary escape rate of albumin.  the transcapillary escape rate of albumin was similar in the control subjects (5.2 +/- 2.7%) and the subjects in the normoalbuminuric groups 3 and 4 (6.2 +/- 1.9 and 5.1 +/- 1.4%, respectively) and significantly lower (p < 0.001) than in patients with elevated urinary albumin excretion without or with hypertension group 2, 10.1 +/- 2.8 and group 5, 11.4 +/- 5.7%.  the effect of hypotensive therapy on the transcapillary escape rate of albumin (teralb) was studied in eight hypertensive insulin-dependent diabetic patients (mean age 29, range 19-42 years) with nephropathy and retinopathy.  indeed, transcapillary escape of albumin (teralb), a measure of systemic capillary efflux, is increased in diabetic patients, even in those with a modest increase of albuminuria.  to evaluate microvascular permeability by the transcapillary escape rate of albumin (teralb) in type ii diabetic patients with normo- and microalbuminuria.  to study the pathophysiologic mechanism leading to increased transcapillar sieving of albumin in patients with diabetic nephropathy, subcutaneous interstitial concentrations of albumin, transferrin, total igg and igg-4 was measured in 30 long-term type 1 diabetic patients using the skin suction blister method.  the transcapillary escape rate of albumin (teralb) is often elevated in patients with diabetic microangiopathy.  to test the hypothesis that insulin influences protein permeability, we measured the albumin transcapillary escape rate (ter) by the (131)i-labeled albumin technique in 12 healthy volunteers and 12 normoalbuminuric niddm patients (fasting plasma glucose, 10.9 +/- 1.3 mmol/l) during 4 h of isoglycemia with high (1.1 mu x min(-1) x kg(-1)) or, on a different day, low (0.1 mu x min(-1) x kg(-1)) insulin infusion.  we studied the following in normo- and microalbuminuric hypertensive type 2 diabetic patients: 1) transcapillary escape rate of albumin (teralb) and 2) expression of mrna slit diaphragm and podocyte proteins in renal biopsies.  transcapillary escape rate of albumin (initial disappearance of intravenously injected 125i-labelled human serum albumin), urinary albumin excretion rate (radial immunodiffusion), and glomerular filtrate rate (single bolus 51-cr-edta technique) were measured.  an increase in urinary albumin excretion (uae) in type 1 diabetic patients might reflect changes in vascular permeability and/or local haemodynamic factors.  human serum albumin was purified from diabetic patients in pre-dialysis (glomerular filtration rate  between 15 and 29 ml min(-1) 1.73 m(-2)) and those in dialysis (gfr ≤ 15 ml min(-1) 1.73 m(-2)) and then compared with albumin from patients with a normal gfr (>90 ml min(-1) m(-2)).  the fractional plasma escape rates of glycated and non-glycated albumin have earlier been measured in groups of type 1 (insulin-dependent) diabetic patients and control subjects.  the following variables were measured: transcapillary escape rate of albumin (initial disappearance of intravenously injected 125i-labelled human serum albumin), and urinary albumin excretion rate (radial immunodiffusion).  the escape of non-glycated albumin was similar in control subjects and normoalbuminuric patients, but elevated in patients with micro or macroalbuminuria.  our findings demonstrate that the enhanced albumin passage through the wall of the microvasculature characteristically found in long-term type 1 diabetic patients with clinical microangiopathy is pressure-dependent to a large extent.  in contrast, high insulin increased renal albumin excretion (from 3.6 +/- 0.8 to 5.4 +/- 1.1 microg/min, p < 0.01) and clearance rate (0.09 +/- 0.02 to 0.13 +/- 0.03 microl/min, p < 0.001) in patients but not in control subjects.  albumin was isolated from type 1 (dm1) and type 2 (dm2) diabetes mellitus (hba1c > 9%) and non-dm subjects (c).  changes in the antioxidant capacity of albumin and alterations of the albumin structural conformation were examined in patients in advanced stages of diabetes nephropathy.  the increased leak of albumin was not explained by differences in diabetes duration, bp, or metabolic control at the time of investigation and was independently related to the presence of microalbuminuria (r = 0.63, percent explained variance approximately 40) and mean ""historical"" hba1c (multiple r = 0.705; total explained variance approximately 50%). ||| ",yes
Is transcription of eRNA bidirectional?,"enhancers undergo bidirectional transcription to generate non-coding enhancer rnas (ernas).  rationale: enhancer rna (erna) bi-directionally expresses from enhancer region and sense erna regulates adjacent mrna in cis and in trans.  enhancers generate bidirectional noncoding enhancer rnas (ernas) that may regulate gene expression.  we also show that rdna is transcribed in antisense orientation.  here we show that noncoding rna (ncrna) in sense and antisense orientation also controls transcription of rrna genes (rdna).  new chromatin interaction among enhancer, promoter and gene-ending region might provide new insight into the spatiotemporal mechanism of the gene transcription and acting of bi-directional ernas.  very recent evidence has indicted that some ernas play a role in initiating or activating transcription, possibly by helping recruit and/or stabilize binding of the general transcription machinery to the proximal promoter of their target genes.  our findings highlight the spatiotemporally regulated action mechanism of ernas during early transcriptional elongation.  enhancer rnas (ernas) are a novel class of non-coding rna (ncrna) molecules transcribed from the dna sequences of enhancer regions.  we demonstrated that the expression of one forward direction (5' to 3') erna transcribed from the human ho-1 e2 enhancer region (named human ho-1enhancer rna e2-3; hereafter called erna e2-3) was induced by dem in an nrf2-dependent manner in hela cells.  transcription at enhancers is a widespread phenomenon which produces so-called enhancer rna (erna) and occurs in an activity-dependent manner.  the results reveal that noncoding rnas in sense and antisense orientation are important determinants of the epigenetic state of rdna.  enhancer rnas (ernas) are a class of long noncoding rnas (lncrna) expressed from active enhancers, whose function and action mechanism are yet to be firmly established.  rdna exists in two types of chromatin--a euchromatic conformation that is permissive to transcription and a heterochromatic conformation that is transcriptionally silent.  recent studies have disclosed the function of enhancer rnas (ernas), which are long non-coding rnas transcribed from gene enhancer regions, in transcriptional regulation.  however, it has remained unclear whether antisense ernas in different direction are functional or merely a reflection of enhancer activation.  instead, chromatin looping might enable ernas to act locally at a specific promoter.  furthermore, we detected numerous known and novel functional rna structures within erna regions.  importantly, the chromatin exhibited a double looping manner that facilitated sense-erna to promoter and antisense-erna to gene-ending region in cis.  since the discovery that many transcriptional enhancers are transcribed into long noncoding rnas termed ""enhancer rnas"" (ernas), their putative role in enhancer function has been debated. ||| ",yes
Is transcription-associated mutagenesis (TAM) related to gene expression levels?,"high transcription is associated with genetic instability, notably increased spontaneous mutation rates, which is a phenomenon termed transcription-associated-mutagenesis (tam).  high-levels of transcription through a gene stimulate spontaneous mutation rate, a phenomenon termed transcription-associated mutation (tam).  reporter gene assays have demonstrated both transcription-associated mutagenesis (tam) and transcription-coupled repair, but the net impact of transcription on mutation rate remains unclear, especially at the genomic scale.  transcription induces mutagenesis on both dna strands, indicating simultaneous actions of several tam mechanisms.  we explored whether transcription level affects spontaneous mutation rate in human cells.  furthermore, increased transcription level stimulates spontaneous mutation rate in yeast.  using this approach, we demonstrate that (i) high levels of transcription correlates with augmented mutation frequency, and (ii) mutation frequency is enhanced in nongrowing population cells deficient for deaminated (ung, ywql) and oxidized guanine (go) excision repair, strongly suggesting that accumulation of spontaneous dna lesions enhance transcription-associated mutagenesis.  these results indicate that transcription is overall mutagenic.  compelling evidence points to transcriptional processes as important factors contributing to stationary-phase associated mutagenesis.  in this study, we investigated tam using the chromosomal can1 gene under the transcriptional control of two strong and inducible promoters (pgal1 and ptet) in saccharomyces cerevisiae.  however, the association between transcription factors and cancers is largely dependent on the transcription regulatory activities rather than mrna expression levels.  using comparative genomics of related species as well as mutation accumulation lines, we show in yeast that the rate of point mutation in a gene increases with the expression level of the gene.  however, the question arises of whether a change in the level of transcription of a specific gene is caused by the transcription factor acting directly at the promoter of the gene or through regulation of other transcription factors working at the promoter.  these alterations in gene expression are likely to contribute to the phenotypic consequences of tetr expression.  transcription factors (tfs) regulate the expression of genes at the transcriptional level.  in many cancers, alteration of tfs results in aberrant activity of them without changing their gene expression level.  the transcription-associated increase in uv-c-induced mutagenesis appears independent of the integration site of the hprt minigene.  given their occurrences in repair-proficient cells, transcription-associated g→t and g→c events represent a novel type of transcription-associated mutagenesis in normal cells with potentially important implications for evolution and genetic disease.  to assess a potential role of dna damage in the tam events, we measured mutation rates and spectra in individual strains defective in the repair of specific dna lesions or null for the error-prone translesion dna polymerase zeta (pol zeta).  when measuring global transcript levels only, the effect of the perturbation  on its target genes is often obscured by delayed feedback and secondary effects until the changes are fully propagated. ||| ",yes
Is treatment resistant depression related to vitamin B9?,"recent literature has identified links between vitamin b12 deficiency and depression.we compared the clinical response of ssri-monotherapy with that of b12-augmentation in a sample of depressed patients with low normal b12 levels who responded inadequately to the first trial with the ssris.  an association between vitamin b12 levels and depressive symptoms (ds) has been reported in several epidemiological studies.  we report a case of vitamin b12 deficiency presenting with recurrent episodes of depression.  deficiencies in both vitamin b12 and folate have been associated with depression.  baseline vitamin b12 and folate levels were obtained in 49 inpatients with treatment-resistant mdd and 34 inpatients with treatment-resistant bipolar depression currently experiencing a major depressive episode.  vitamin b12 supplementation with antidepressants significantly improved depressive symptoms in our cohort.  to determine whether vitamins b6, b12 and folic acid enhance response to antidepressant treatment over 52 weeks.  our results do not support the hypothesis that a low dietary intake of b(6-9-12) vitamins and high levels of serum homocysteine are related to depression in healthy elderly men.  we confirm literature data regarding the link between bdnf plasma levels, depression and antidepressant treatments.  recently, higher baseline vitamin b12 levels were observed in individuals with bipolar depression who responded to the antidepressant ketamine at 7 days post-infusion.  melancholic ds and vitamin b12 levels showed an independent linearly inverse association.  we investigated whether a low dietary intake of b(6-9-12) vitamins and high levels of serum homocysteine are associated with depressive symptoms in elderly men.  vitamin b12 and homocysteine have been shown to be associated with depression or depressive symptoms, but the relationship has not been universal.  it is possible that low levels of vitamin b12 or holotranscobalamin are associated with depressive symptoms via mechanisms other than vascular pathology.  although many studies found an association between psychiatric disorders, especially major depressive disorder, and vitamin d deficiency, little is still known about the association between vitamin d and bipolar disorder (bd).  b vitamins did not increase the 12-week efficacy of antidepressant treatment, but enhanced and sustained antidepressant response over 1 year.  moreover, although an association between vitamin d levels and clinical symptomatology was observed in bd patients, it cannot be considered a specific marker of this disorder but a common characteristic shared with other psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia and major depressive disorder.  lower levels of holotranscobalamin and vitamin b12 were associated with higher levels of depressive symptoms when controlled for mini-mental state examination scores and psychosocial and cardiovascular risk factors.  this study sought to -replicate this result by correlating peripheral vitamin levels with ketamine's antidepressant efficacy in bipolar depression and major depressive disorder (mdd).  high plasma homocysteine has been consistently associated with depression, and treatment with certain b vitamins demonstrably reduces its concentration. ||| ",yes
Is tretinoin effective for photoaging?,"the efficacy of topical tretinoin (all-trans-retinoic acid) in treating photoaging is well established.  tretinoin can be used for photoaging treatment or combined treatment by different mechanisms.  topical tretinoin has been proposed for the treatment of photoaged skin in recent years.  topical tretinoin is an effective therapy for the treatment of photodamaged skin.  the ability of topical tretinoin to improve certain signs of skin photodamage has been shown previously.  both from carefully designed controlled clinical studies; and basic investigations into the mechanism by which tretinoin improves photoaged skin, our understanding of photoaging has been enhanced.  both 0.1% and 0.025% tretinoin produced statistically significant overall improvement in photoaging of the face compared with vehicle; there were no clinically or statistically significant differences in efficacy between the two concentrations of tretinoin.  topical administration of tretinoin has proved to be effective in treating clinical signs of photodamaged skin.  topical tretinoin has been reported as having anti-aging effects on photodamaged skin.  although once considered an irreversible process, it is now established that photoaging can be treated by topical tretinoin.  thus, topical tretinoin is safe and effective in the treatment of photodamage.  topical tretinoin is a medication commonly used for acne that has potential application in the long-term treatment of photodamaged skin.  thus, topical tretinoin has been shown to be an effective form of treatment for the characteristic signs of photodamaged skin.  a double-blind, placebo-controlled study confirmed that topical tretinoin produced an overall improvement in photoaged skin and decreased solar keratoses.  tretinoin is still the best tested retinoid to reverse photoaged skin.  because of that, we think tretinoin peeling would be an excellent choice for improvement of photoaged skin.  topical tretinoin has been used for a long time to improve photoaged skin, but this therapy takes quite a few months to show some clinical changes.  topical tretinoin (retin-a) can reverse photoaging of the skin, although some transient, undesirable side effects usually occur.  tretinoin (all-trans-retinoic acid) is a retinol (vitamin a) derivative which has been evaluated as a topical treatment for the symptoms of photodamaged skin.  this paper reviews some of the newer uses of tretinoin, including treatment of patients with photoaging of the skin, premalignant lesions, dry-eye disorders, and its use after dermabrasion. ||| ",yes
Is triadin involved in cardiac function?,"triadin is involved in the regulation of cardiac excitation-contraction coupling.  during the last 20 years, the identification of triadin function in cardiac and skeletal muscle has been the focus of numerous studies.  triadin is a protein expressed in cardiac and skeletal muscle that has an essential role in the structure and functional regulation of calcium release units and excitation-contraction coupling.  triadin is a component of the calcium release complex of cardiac and skeletal muscle.  this review summarizes current concepts of the impact of triadin on cardiac ec coupling with a focus towards triadin's role for ventricular arrhythmia.  novel therapeutic approaches could be aimed at correcting the loss of triadin in diseased hearts, and thereby correcting the sub-cellular ec coupling defect.  we conclude that triadin 1 is the triadin isoform most likely to play a role in ca(2+) release in heart.  triadin 1 is a protein in the cardiac junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum (sr) that interacts with the ryanodine receptor, junctin, and calsequestrin, proteins that are important for ca(2+) release.  the putative role(s) of triadin(s) will be discussed here.  triadin 1 is a major transmembrane protein in cardiac junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum (sr), which forms a quaternary complex with the ryanodine receptor (ca(2+) release channel), junctin, and calsequestrin.  our data show that the stable expression of triadin, independent of junctin expression, resulted in cardiac hypertrophy, prolonged basal relaxation, a depressed response to beta-adrenergic agonists, and altered ca transients.  our results provide evidence for the coordinated regulation of junctional sr protein expression in heart independent of free sr protein expression, and furthermore suggest an important role for triadin 1 in regulating the contractile properties of the heart during excitation-contraction coupling.  several triadin isoforms have been postulated to exist in cardiac muscle, but to date none has been conclusively identified.  triadin is a major membrane protein that is specifically localized in the junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum of skeletal muscle and is thought to play an important role in muscle excitation-contraction coupling.  although a 92-kda immunoreactive protein could be tentatively identified in myocardium as triadin 3, its expression level was insignificant (</=5%) compared with that of triadin 1.  to better understand the role of triadin 1 in excitation-contraction coupling in the heart, we generated transgenic mice with targeted overexpression of triadin 1 to mouse atrium and ventricle, employing the alpha-myosin heavy chain promoter to drive protein expression.  triadin is a protein first identified as a member of the muscle calcium release complex, involved in calcium release for muscle contraction.  in this review, we cover the roles of cardiac titin in normal and failing hearts, with a special emphasis on the contribution of titin to diastolic stiffness.  thus the maintenance of triadin expression is essential for normal sr ca cycling and contractile function.  first thought of as the missing link between the ryanodine receptor and the dihydropyridine receptor and responsible of skeletal type excitation-contraction coupling, the current hypothesis on triadin function has slowly evolved, and triadin is envisaged now as a regulator of calcium release, both in cardiac and skeletal muscle. ||| ",yes
Is tubulin acetylation involved in cell motility?,"tubulin acetylation plays an important role in cellular activities including cell polarity, cell migration, vesicle transport, and cell development.  this review discusses the cellular distribution and dynamics of acetylated tubulin and its role in regulating cellular activities.  here, we found that tubulin acetylation is required for the mechanical stabilization of long-lived microtubules in cells.  thus, it is important to elucidate the mechanisms underlying tubulin acetylation and its effects on cellular activity to understand these diseases and to design potential therapeutic strategies.  acetylation of α-tubulin by the acetyltransferase atat1 modulates microtubule dynamics and functions in neurons.  acetylation is a well-studied post-translational modification (ptm) of tubulin.  abnormal tubulin acetylation has been implicated in neurodegenerative disorders, ciliopathies, and cancers.  the kinetics of conformational changes in acetylated tubulin may elucidate microtubule functions in these cellular activities.  we investigate whether acetylation alters the architecture of microtubules or the conformation of tubulin, using cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-em).  we also investigate the interaction of the tubulin acetyltransferase, αtat1, with microtubules and find that αtat1 is able to interact with the outside of the microtubule, at least partly through the tubulin c-termini.  together, our data suggest that axonal transport of atat1-enriched vesicles is the predominant driver of α-tubulin acetylation in axons.  reversible acetylation of α-tubulin has been implicated in modulating microtuble structures and functions, which may subsequently involve in cellular apoptosis and autophage.  acetylated tubulin is present in the centrioles, primary cilia, and flagella, which contain long-lived stable microtubules.  the functions of microtubules are controlled in part by tubulin post-translational modification including acetylation of lys⁴⁰ in α-tubulin.  atat1 possibly affects various cellular functions related with microtubules, such as intracellular transport, cell motility, cilia formation, and neuronal signaling.  acetylation of lys-40 on α-tubulin is unique in that it is located on the luminal surface of microtubules, away from the interaction sites of most maps and motors.  hdac6, the tubulin deacetylase, plays a key role in maintaining typical distribution of acetylated microtubules in cells.  microtubules are involved in cell growth and division, motility, signalling and in the development and maintenance of cell shape.  the microtubule cytoskeleton is composed of α-tubulin and β-tubulin heterodimers, and it serves to regulate the shape, motility, and division of a cell.  we considered that long-lived microtubules are acetylated inside their lumen and that microtubule acetylation may modify microtubule mechanics. ||| ",yes
Is valproic acid effective for glioblastoma treatment?,"valproic acid (vpa) has been recently investigated for its anticancer properties in different tumors, including malignant gliomas.  retrospective evidence suggests that valproic acid (vpa), an antiepileptic drug, is associated with improved outcomes in glioblastoma.  valproic acid (vpa) is an antiepileptic agent with histone deacetylase inhibitor activity shown to enhance overall survival and progression free survival in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma (gbm).  valproic acid (vpa) is a histone deacetylase inhibitor that apart from its anticonvulsive effects in some retrospective studies has been suggested to lead to a superior outcome of glioblastoma patients.  valproic acid (vpa), a widely used antiepileptic drug, has been found to have antitumor effects on gliomas, but its role still has not been determined.  valproic acid (va) is an antiepileptic drug (aed) and histone deacetylase (hdac) inhibitor taken by patients with glioblastoma (gb) to manage seizures, and it can modulate the biologic effects of radiation therapy (rt).  valproic acid (vpa) is an antiepileptic agent with hdaci (histone deacetylase inhibitor) activity shown to radiosensitize glioblastoma (gbm) cells.  valproic acid (vpa), an established antiepileptic drug, was assessed for antitumor activity, including its effects on glioblastoma, but its role has not been determined.  valproic acid (vpa), an anticonvulsant and mood-stabilizing drug is used to treat epileptic seizure of glioblastoma patients.  valproic acid (vpa) is an antiepileptic agent with histone deacetylase inhibitor (hdaci) activity shown to sensitize glioblastoma (gbm) cells to radiation in preclinical models.  to examine the efficacy of valproic acid (vpa) given either with or without levetiracetam (lev) on seizure control and on survival in patients with glioblastoma multiforme (gbm) treated with chemoradiation.  valproic acid (vpa), one of the most common histone deacetylase inhibitors (hdacis), has been detected to directly or synergistically exert inhibitory effects on glioma in vitro and in vivo.  the antiepileptic drug valproic acid (vpa) inhibits histone deacetylase in glioblastoma cells in vitro, which influences several oncogenic pathways and decreases glioma cell proliferation.  therefore, valproic acid may represent a novel therapeutic option in medulloblastoma treatment.  to evaluate the antitumor efficacy and mechanisms of action of valproic acid in medulloblastoma and supratentorial primitive neuroectodermal tumor (spnet), which are among the most common malignant brain tumors in children with poor prognosis, two medulloblastoma (daoy and d283-med) and one spnet (pfsk) cell lines were treated with valproic acid and evaluated with a panel of in vitro and in vivo assays.  valproic acid is frequently prescribed and used to treat epilepsy, bipolar disorder and other conditions.  similar concentrations of valproic acid added to neuro-2a, sk-n-sh and c6 cell lines as well as human ntera-2 astrocytes did not evoke cell death.  valproic acid (vpa) is an established drug in the long-term therapy of epilepsy.  the anti-epileptic drug valproic acid is also under trial as an anti-cancer agent due to its histone deacetylase (hdac) inhibitory properties.  valproic acid is widely used for the treatment of epilepsy and mood disorders, but its mode of action is unclear. ||| ",yes
Is vemurafenib effective for hairy-cell leukemia?,"a short oral course of vemurafenib was highly effective in patients with relapsed or refractory hairy-cell leukemia.  we assessed the safety and activity of the oral braf inhibitor vemurafenib in patients with hairy-cell leukemia that had relapsed after treatment with a purine analogue or who had disease that was refractory to purine analogues.  selective braf inhibitors such as vemurafenib have become a treatment option in patients with langerhans cell histiocytosis (lch).  the recent oncogene-directed therapeutic, vemurafenib, usually produces high level of tumor shrinkage and survival benefits in many patients with b-raf (v600e) mutant melanomas, although the fast and high degrees of responses are likely short-lived.  many patients treated with vemurafenib initially display dramatic improvement, with decreases in both risk of death and tumor progression.  vemurafenib has clinically significant antitumor activity in metastatic melanoma, and response rates and overall and progression-free survival rates are improved when compared with dacarbazine.  vemurafenib, an inhibitor of mutated b-rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma, is frequently used in the treatment of melanoma and erdheim-chester disease (ecd) patients.  vemurafenib (zelboraf) is an orally available brafv600e inhibitor approved for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic brafv600e -mutant melanoma.  similar to the previously published data our analysis confirms the improved survival with vemurafenib treatment (11.47 months) in patients with braf v600 mutation.  vemurafenib is now approved for use in this patient population.  vemurafenib is an adenosine triphosphate-competitive, reversible, and highly selective braf kinase inhibitor targeted at braf-v600e and is a first-line option for patients with braf-mutation-positive disease.  the oncogenic braf inhibitor vemurafenib improves outcomes for patients with advanced brafv600 mutation-positive melanoma compared with cytotoxic chemotherapy.  the braf inhibitor vemurafenib is currently used for treating patients with braf v600e mutant melanoma.  vemurafenib (plx4032), a selective inhibitor of braf, has been approved by the us food and drug administration for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic melanoma in patients with braf(v600e) mutations.  we demonstrate no significant effect from vemurafenib on cd4+ and cd8+ t-cell cytokine production or on a t-cell-mediated antitumor response.  braf inhibitor vemurafenib achieved improved overall survival over chemotherapy and have been approved by the fda and ema for the treatment of braf-mutated metastatic melanoma.  our data suggest for the first time that vemurafenib at the dose of 240 mg once a day could be sufficient to maintain a complete hematological remission after an initial induction treatment with low-dose vemurafenib (2 × 240 mg) daily without inducing major toxicity.  canertinib statistically increased the antiproliferative effects of vemurafenib in the braf mutant melanoma cell lines while little or no enhanced effect was observed with the combination treatment in the wildtype cell lines.  our data demonstrate that vemurafenib does not significantly affect braf wt targets, suggesting that there may be a role for combining vemurafenib treatment with t-cell-directed immunotherapy.  hairy cell leukemia (hcl) is a chronic b-cell lymphoproliferative disorder that accounts for 2% of all leukemia. ||| ",yes
Is vemurafenib used for thyroid cancer?,"vemurafenib, a selective braf inhibitor, appears to have promising clinical activity in patients with papillary thyroid cancer (ptc) harboring the braf(v600e) mutation.  vandetanib is an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor approved for treatment of advanced symptomatic or progressive medullary thyroid cancer (mtc).  vandetanib is the most widely used tyrosine kinase inhibitor for the treatment of patients with advanced medullary thyroid cancer (mtc).  a new study shows that the braf inhibitor vemurafenib may induce partial responses and stable disease in patients with papillary thyroid cancer that has become refractory to radioactive iodine.  unfortunately, vemurafenib often displays limited efficacy in poorly differentiated and anaplastic thyroid carcinomas probably because of intrinsic and/or acquired resistance mechanisms.  the tyrosine kinase inhibitors (tki) vandetanib and cabozantinib are approved as targeted therapies in advanced medullary thyroid carcinoma (mtc) with symptoms or high tumour burden.  this phase 2 study investigated the efficacy and safety of dovitinib (tki258), a receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor with potent activity against fibroblast growth factor receptor (fgfr) and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (vegfr), in locally advanced or metastatic thyroid cancer patients.  vandetanib was recently approved for the treatment of medullary thyroid cancer.  our data demonstrate that vemurafenib induces er stress response-mediated autophagy in thyroid cancer and autophagy inhibition may be a beneficial strategy to sensitize braf-mutant thyroid cancer to vemurafenib.  vandetanib is the first targeted drug to show evidence of efficacy in a randomised phase 2 trial in patients with locally advanced or metastatic differentiated thyroid carcinoma.  indeed, vemurafenib did not inhibit cell proliferation of braf v600e thyroid cscs, but rather stimulated cell proliferation along with a paradoxical over-activation of erk and akt pathways.  vemurafenib induced a high level of autophagy in braf-mutant thyroid cancer cells.  two tyrosine kinase inhibitors (tkis), vandetanib and cabozantinib, have been approved for recurrent/metastatic (r/m) medullary thyroid carcinoma (mtc).  dovitinib has a modest activity with manageable toxicity in locally advanced or metastatic thyroid cancer.  vemurafenib is a potentially effective and well-tolerated treatment strategy in patients with advanced ptc harboring the braf(v600e) mutation.  the brafv600e inhibitor vemurafenib is widely used to treat melanomas harboring the activated brafv600e mutation; however, vemurafenib showed poor efficacy in colon cancer, which impeded its clinical application for colon cancer patients with this mutation.  however, braf-mutant thyroid cancer is relatively resistant to vemurafenib, and the reason for this disparity remains unclear.  vemurafenib is a selective and potent small molecule inhibitor of the v600 mutant form of the braf protein used in the treatment of melanoma and colorectal cancer.  these findings highlight that hmgb1-mediated autophagy may account for vemurafenib resistance in thyroid cancer harboring braf mutation, implying a promising approach to overcome vemurafenib resistance in vemurafenib-mutant thyroid carcinomas.  vemurafenib, an inhibitor of mutated b-rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma, is frequently used in the treatment of melanoma and erdheim-chester disease (ecd) patients. ||| ",yes
Is vorinostat effective for glioblastoma?,"vorinostat, a histone deacetylase inhibitor, represents a rational therapeutic target in glioblastoma multiforme (gbm).  vorinostat is a histone deacetylase (hdac) inhibitor that inhibits cell proliferation and induces apoptosis in solid tumors, and is in clinical trials for the treatment of glioblastoma (gbm).  we sought to study vorinostat (vor), a histone deacetylase inhibitor, in combination with bevacizumab (bev) and daily metronomic temozolomide (tmz) in a phase i/ii trial in recurrent high-grade gliomas (hggs).  combination regimen with bevacizumab (bev) and vorinostat is well tolerated in patients with recurrent glioblastoma.treatment of recurrent glioblastoma remains challenging as this study and others attempt to improve progression-free survival and overall survival with bev-containing regimens.  vorinostat monotherapy is well tolerated in patients with recurrent gbm and has modest single-agent activity.  glioblastoma, an incurable, malignant, and highly vascular tumor, is a seemingly ideal target for anti-angiogenic therapies such as bevacizumab, an anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (vegf) monoclonal antibody.  purpose: anti-vegf therapies remain controversial in the treatment of recurrent glioblastoma (gbm).  bevacizumab has demonstrated activity in patients with recurrent glioblastoma.  in this review, we generalize the latest advances of vpa in treating glioma and its underlying mechanisms and clinical implications, providing a clearer profile for clinical application of vpa as a therapeutic agent for glioma.  the highly vascular malignant brain tumor glioblastoma (gbm) appears to be an ideal target for anti-angiogenic therapy; however, clinical trials to date suggest the vegf antibody bevacizumab affects only progression-free survival.  bevacizumab has promising activity against recurrent glioblastoma (gbm).  although anti-vegf therapy is widely used in high-grade gliomas, no predictor of response or toxicity has been reported yet.  phase ii trials in recurrent glioblastoma demonstrated bevacizumab was associated with clinical benefits, including decreases in brain edema and corticosteroids use resulting from reduced vascular permeability, as well as radiographic responses in 25 %-40 % of patients.  bevacizumab is one of the rare drugs that could improve high-grade glioma outcome after failure of chemoradiotherapy.  a positive impact of bevacizumab administration on os of patients with glioblastoma multiforme is suggested.  to analyze the prognostic factors and clinical benefits of bevacizumab and irinotecan treatment in patients with recurrent glioblastoma.  the optimal treatment for recurrent glioblastoma (rgbm) is not well defined.  the optimal combination of bevacizumab with cytotoxic or cytostatic drugs in recurrent glioblastoma is unknown.  antiangiogenic therapy has been shown to be efficacious in the treatment of high-grade gliomas both in preclinical models and in clinical trials.  we performed a phase 2 trial of combined bevacizumab and fotemustine for patients with glioblastoma at first relapse after radiotherapy and temozolomide. ||| ",no
Is vortioxetine effective for treatment of depression?,"clinical studies indicate that vortioxetine is effective in the treatment of major depression, though there is no suggestion of superiority over active comparators.  vortioxetine is a novel antidepressant capable of improving depressive and cognitive symptoms associated with major depressive disorder (mdd).  objective is to evaluate if new antidepressant vortioxetine may be a potential treatment option.  vortioxetine is a novel antidepressant, approved by the us food and drug administration (fda) for the treatment of major depressive disorder (mdd).  vortioxetine is a multimodal antidepressant approved for treatment of major depressive disorder.  antidepressant efficacy in major depressive disorder has been established in registration studies, but the effectiveness of vortioxetine in 'real world' patients and in comparison to other antidepressants needs further investigation.  at present, vortioxetine can be considered as an antidepressant option in patients with established major depressive disorder who have not responded adequately to other antidepressants.  vortioxetine is a potent antagonist of the 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor and serotonin transporter and has been reported to function as an antidepressant in the treatment of major depressive disorder.  vortioxetine is approved for the treatment of major depressive disorder and differs from other antidepressants in terms of its pharmacodynamic profile.  vortioxetine is a novel multimodal antidepressant that has improved cognitive function including executive function in depressed patients in randomised placebo-controlled clinical trials.  vortioxetine is approved for the treatment of major depressive disorder (mdd).  additionally, vortioxetine has beneficial effects on aspects of cognitive dysfunction in depressed patients.  conclusion : the mechanism of action, the efficacy on depression and safety profile and early data on cognitive impairment make vortioxetine a strong candidate for use in depression associated with cerebrovascular disease.  vortioxetine has also been shown to alleviate cognitive symptoms in preclinical studies and in patients with depression.  preclinical and clinical observations showed that vortioxetine (vort, an antidepressant with multimodal activity), presents beneficial effects on aspects of cognitive function.  the aim of this paper was to review the up-to-date evidence base on pharmacology and clinical properties of vortioxetine.  because vortioxetine exhibits both an antidepressant and anxiolytic effect, it may be effective in treating both depressive and anxiety disorders, such as generalized anxiety disorder (gad).  this paper aims to provide clinicians with a brief overview of vortioxetine and its place in treatment.  vortioxetine is a well tolerated treatment, showing statistically lower withdrawal rates due to aes compared with other antidepressants.  to assess the relative efficacy and tolerability of vortioxetine against different antidepressant monotherapies in patients with major depressive disorder (mdd) with inadequate response to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (ssri) or serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (snri) therapy. ||| ",yes
Is zolpidem an antibiotic?,"zolpidem (trade name ambien ®) is commonly prescribed.  zolpidem (n,n-dimethyl-2-pyridin-3-yl]acetamide) is a well-known drug for the treatment of sleeping disorders.  zolpidem is a rapid-onset, short-duration imidazopyridine hypnotic drug and is specific agonist of the omega-1 (bzd1) receptors.  zolpidem is a widely used hypnotic drug acting via benzodiazepine binding sites on gaba(a) receptors.  a hypnotic drug zolpidem is used in clinical practice for more than 25 years.  zolpidem is the prototype of a class of sedative hypnotic drugs that are derivatives of imidazopyridine and is sold in the united states under the trade name ambien.  however, unlike benzodiazepines, zolpidem exerts sedative actions at relatively low doses.  zolpidem, a commonly prescribed hypnotic, is an imidazopyridine that purportedly has a unique benzodiazepine-receptor binding profile.  because of its short half-life, zolpidem plays a special role in the group of drugs suitable for anesthesiological premedication because of its sedative and anxiolytic effects.  zolpidem (zol), an omega1-agonist, acts via gaba(a) receptors but may differ qualitatively from diazepam (dz) and other benzodiazepines (bzds).  zolpidem's pharmacological profile includes anticonvulsant, antipunishment and behavioral depressant actions.  the imidazopyridine derivative zolpidem , which acts as a benzodiazepine (bz) receptor agonist, is the most widely prescribed hypnotic drug in the us.  zolpidem is a hypnotic medication that mainly exerts its function through activating γ-aminobutyric acid (gaba)a receptors.  zolpidem, which is currently marketed in europe as a hypnotic, is a short-duration imidazopyridine whose actions are mediated at the gamma-aminobutyric acid benzodiazepine receptor complex.  we conclude zolpidem be considered a safe drug with respect to the possible interactions through ahr- and pxr-dependent induction of drug-metabolizing cyps.  the results suggest that in addition to strong sedative activity zolpidem has potent anticonvulsant properties.  zolpidem, a new imidazo-pyridine hypnotic, acts like a benzodiazepine.  zolpidem, an imidazopyridine that purportedly binds selectively to certain gaba(a) receptor subtypes, is the most commonly prescribed hypnotic.  the primary aim was to determine how commonly zolpidem ingestion results in hospital evaluation and admission.  assuming that phenobarbital is a potent sedative, the reported results confirm the results found by other authors, that zolpidem also acts as a sedative. ||| ",no
Is zyxin a focal adhesion protein?,"zyxin is an evolutionarily conserved protein that has been implicated in the regulation of actin assembly and is mainly located at focal adhesions.  zyxin is a member of the focal adhesion complex and plays a critical role in actin filament polymerization and cell motility.  zyxin is a focal adhesion protein that has been implicated in the modulation of cell adhesion and motility, and is hypothesized to be a mechano-sensor in integrin-mediated responses to mechanical force.  zyxin, a lim domain protein, is localized primarily at focal adhesion plaques.  as zyx is present in focal adhesions (fas), an immense part of research is focused on the role of this protein in the organisation and function of the cytoskeleton.  to define the cellular role of the focal adhesion protein zyxin, we characterized the phenotype of fibroblasts in which the zyxin gene was deleted by homologous recombination.  zyxin, a focal adhesion molecule, contains lim domains and shuttles between the cytoplasm and the nucleus.  the focal adhesion protein zyxin emerged as a key regulator of actin assembly because zyxin recruits enabled/vasodilator-stimulated phospho-proteins (ena/vasp) to promote actin assembly.  previous studies have shown that zyxin, a focal adhesion protein, is recruited at force-bearing sites on the actin cytoskeleton and, therefore, identifying zyxin as a mechano-sensing protein candidate.  zyxin is an 82-kd protein first identified as a component of adhesion plaques and the termini of stress fibers near where they associate with the cytoplasmic face of the adhesive membrane.  zyxin is a focal-adhesion-associated phosphoprotein with one domain involved in the control of actin assembly and three protein-protein adapter domains implicated in the regulation of cell growth and differentiation.  zyxin is a dual-function lim domain protein that regulates actin dynamics in response to mechanical stress and shuttles between focal adhesions and the cell nucleus.  zyxin also localizes to the sites of cell-cell adhesion and is thought to promote actin assembly with ena/vasp.  zyxin is an adhesion protein that regulates actin assembly by binding to vasp family members through n-terminal proline-rich motifs.  zyxin is a focal adhesion phosphoprotein that shares homology with listeria acta protein in promoting actin filament assembly; it also has specialized protein-protein interface domains implicating an important role in cell growth and differentiation.  based on its repertoire of binding partners and its behavior, zyxin may serve as a scaffold for the assembly of multimeric protein machines that function in the nucleus and at sites of cell adhesion.  zyxin co-localizes with integrins at sites of cell-substratum adhesion and is postulated to serve as a docking site for the assembly of multimeric protein complexes involved in regulating cell motility.  zyxin is an evolutionarily conserved protein that is concentrated at sites of cell adhesion, where it associates with members of the enabled (ena)/vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (vasp) family of cytoskeletal regulators and is postulated to play a role in cytoskeletal dynamics and signaling.  zyxin can translocate from focal adhesions (fas) to the nucleus responds to stretch, and regulate gene transcription by interaction with transcription factors like nuclear matrix protein 4 (nmp4).  zyxin is a low abundance phosphoprotein that is localized at sites of cell-substratum adhesion in fibroblasts. ||| ",yes
Proteomic analyses need prior knowledge of the organism complete genome. Is the complete genome of the bacteria of the genus Arthrobacter available?,"while third generation sequencing technologies have been suggested to enable finished metagenome-assembled genomes, to our knowledge, the complete genome assembly of all dominant strains in a microbiome sample has not been demonstrated.  the recent availability of complete sequences for numerous closely related bacterial genomes opens up new challenges in comparative genomics.  the entire genome sequences for a number of microbial organisms have become available over the past few years.  the growing number of complete microbial genome sequences provides a powerful tool for studying the biology of microorganisms.  despite the complete determination of the genome sequence of a huge number of bacteria, their proteomes remain relatively poorly defined.  with the availability of whole genome sequences, the gene content based approaches appear promising in inferring the bacterial taxonomy.  the advent of high-throughput sequencing technologies has dramatically increased the amount of completed bacterial genomes, for both known human pathogenic and non-pathogenic strains; this information is now available to investigate genetic features that determine pathogenic phenotypes in bacteria.  with the advent of high-throughput whole-genome sequencing, it is now possible to sequence a bacterial genome in a matter of hours.  this allowed us to get a more complete picture of prokaryotic genomes.  the complete genome sequencing of a bacterial genome often reveals a substantial number of unique genes present only in that genome which can be used for its taxonomic classification.  new massive sequencing technologies are providing many bacterial genome sequences from diverse taxa but a refined annotation of these genomes is crucial for obtaining scientific findings and new knowledge.  while a de novo genome assembly of an isolated bacterial strain is in most cases straightforward, more informative data about co-existing bacteria as well as synergistic and antagonistic effects can be obtained from a direct analysis of microbial communities.  currently, proteomic tools are able to establish a complete list of the most abundant proteins present in a sample, providing the opportunity to study at high resolution the physiology of any bacteria for which the genome sequence is available.  hundreds of bacterial genome sequences are now available for comparative genomics, and searching a given protein against more than a thousand genomes will soon be possible.  any efficient tool designed specifically to annotate bacterial genomes sequenced with massively parallel technologies has to consider the specific features of bacterial genomes (absence of introns and scarcity of nonprotein-coding sequence) and of next-generation sequencing (ngs) technologies (presence of errors and not perfectly assembled genomes).  in this work we determined presence/absence patterns of 814 different virulence-related genes among more than 600 finished bacterial genomes from both human pathogenic and non-pathogenic strains, belonging to different taxonomic groups (i.e: actinobacteria, gammaproteobacteria, firmicutes, etc.).  here we present recent developments on mosaic, a generalist comparative bacterial genome database.  twenty-six complete prokaryotic genomes were analyzed using this tool, and the accuracy of gene finding was assessed by comparison with existing annotations.  in this study, we have proposed a comprehensive method which uses the taxon-specific genes for the correct taxonomic assignment of existing and new bacterial genomes.  here, we demonstrate the feasibility of complete de novo genome assembly of all dominant strains from low-complexity nwcs based on whole metagenomics shotgun sequencing data. ||| ",yes
"SGOT is an abbreviation for an enzyme other wise known as alanine amino transferase, yes or no?","aspartate aminotransferase (aat) catalyzes amino group transfer from glutamate (glu) or aspartate (asp) to a keto acid acceptor-oxaloacetate (oa) or alpha-ketoglutarate (kg), respectively.  this enzyme shows not only the agt activity but also serine:pyruvate and serine: glyoxylate aminotransferase (spt and sgt) activities.  in the assay of agt activity using crude enzyme preparations, there is the complication that glutamate:glyoxylate aminotransferase (ggt) also contributes to agt activity, but at present no other enzyme is known to catalyze transamination between l-serine and glyoxylate or pyruvate.  glutamate 1-semialdehyde aminotransferase (gsa-at) catalyzes the transfer of the c2 amino group of glutamate 1-semialdehyde (gsa) to the c1 position.  exchange is dependent on aat concentration, time-dependent, proportional to the amino-to-keto acid ratio, and blocked by aminooxyacetate (aoa), an aat inhibitor.  glutamate 1-semialdehyde aminotransferase (glutamate 1-semialdehyde 2,1-aminomutase; ec 5.4.3.8; gsa-at) catalyzes the transfer of the amino group on carbon 2 of glutamate 1-semialdehyde (gsa) to the neighboring carbon 1 to form delta-aminolevulinic acid (ala).  this mutation is located in exon 2 of the agt gene and leads to the loss of an avai restriction site.  we have examined assay methods and conditions for human liver alanine:glyoxylate aminotransferase (agt).  aspartate aminotransferase (ast) can exist as a macroenzyme by forming a complex with an immunoglobulin.  data presented here show that aat catalyzes two partial reactions resulting in isotope exchange between 3h-labeled glu or 3h-labeled asp and the cognate keto acid in the absence of the keto acid acceptor required for the net reaction.  aat-2 uses 2-amino-4-methoxy-4-oxobutanoic acid at a similar rate as l-aspartate but aat-1 uses this substrate at a slower rate.  stoichiometry of purified astgt demonstrated that 0.1 pyridoxal phosphate was attached per subunit of the enzyme.  selenocysteine (sec) trna()sec donates sec to protein, but interestingly, this amino acid is synthesized on trna which is first aminoacylated with serine.  there was a combined good correlation between the agt, sgt and spt activities, and the activity ratio, agt : sgt : spt was about 1.0 : 0.17 : 0.13.  oligosaccharyltransferase (ost) transfers an oligosaccharide chain to the asn residue in the asn-x-ser/thr sequon in proteins, where x is not proline.  we have synthesized and sequenced alanine:glyoxylate aminotransferase (agt; hgmw-approved symbol for the gene--agxt) cdna from the liver of a primary hyperoxaluria type 1 (ph1) patient who had normal levels of hepatic peroxisomal immunoreactive agt protein, but no agt catalytic activity.  aspartate aminotransferase (aat, ec 2.6.1.1) catalyses the transamination of l-asparate to oxaloacetate.  aat isotope exchange is discussed in the context of the glutamate/glutamine shuttle hypothesis for astrocyte/neuron carbon cycling.  this revealed the presence of a single point mutation (g----a at cdna nucleotide 367), which is predicted to cause a glycine-to-glutamate substitution at residue 82 of the agt protein.  although serine acetyltransferase (sat) from escherichia coli is homologous with a number of bacterial enzymes that catalyze o-acetyl transfer by a sequential (ternary complex) mechanism, it has been suggested, from experiments with the nearly identical enzyme from salmonella typhimurium, that the reaction could proceed via an acetyl-enzyme intermediate. ||| ",no
The TRPM2 gene is associated with development of spontaneous thromboembolism?,"in this article we analyse other possible risk factors for thromboembolic events in patients with carriage of ptm.  a mutation in the thrombomodulin gene is a potential risk factor for venous and arterial thrombosis.  factor v leiden (fvl) and prothrombin g20210a mutation (ptm) are the two most common genetic polymorphisms known to predispose to a first episode of venous thromboembolism (vte).  factor v leiden (fvl) and prothrombin g20210a mutation (ptm) are the two most common genetic polymorphisms known to predispose to a first episode of venous thromboembolism (vte).  a prothrombin gene mutation (ptgm) is the second common cause of inherited thrombophilia after factor v leiden.  employing statistical analysis, we found relatively high prevalence of the ptm in both, the patients with positive thrombosis history (6.9 %), as well as in the control group (2.6 %).  polymorphism in the factor v gene named hr2 has been described as a possible risk factor for venous thromboembolism (vte) development.  trpm2 is the second member of the transient receptor potential melastatin-related (trpm) family of cation channels.  the g20210a transition of the prothrombin gene has been identified as a common but probably mild hereditary risk factor for venous thromboembolism (vte).  carriers of a mutation in the prothrombin (clotting factor ii) or factor v gene have a 2- to 4-fold greater risk for venous thromboembolism than subjects without the mutations.  the main aim of this study was to identify the ptm in the patients with positive history of thrombotic events vs. control subjects.  the trpm6 rs2274924 polymorphism may be associated with susceptibility to epilepsy following stroke, and the c allele may be associated with increased risk of post-stroke epilepsy.  trpm2 is a ca(2+)-permeable cationic channel of the transient receptor potential (trp) superfamily that is linked to apoptotic signalling.  we hypothesized that trpm2 is important for visceral nociception and the development of visceral hypersensitivity.  clinical studies have suggested a potentially ""protective"" variant of the thrombospondin gene 2 (thbs2, mim*188061).  trpm2 has previously been shown to be activated by adp-ribose, which is produced by poly(adp-ribose) polymerase 1 (parp-1).  trpm2 contributes to the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease, and inflammatory and neuropathic pain.  after adjustment for other tested defects for thrombophilia, hr2 haplotype was associated with increased risk of thromboembolic events (or = 3.05, 95% ci = 1.11-8.35, p = 0.03).  we attempted to determine whether a functional polymorphism of trpm6 (rs2274924) is associated with susceptibility to epilepsy following ischemic stroke, and to further explore the effect of this polymorphism on serum levels of mg2+ in post-stroke patients.  tnf-induced trpm2 activation may contribute to cardiomyocyte cell death. ||| ",no
Was modafinil tested for schizophrenia treatment?,"the present study indicates modafinil as a potential adjunctive treatment strategy for treatment of schizophrenia particularly the negative symptoms.  modafinil (2-((diphenylmethyl)sulfinyl)acetamide) is described as an atypical stimulant and is a putative cognition enhancer for schizophrenia, but the precise mechanisms of action remain unclear.  2-acetamide (modafinil), prescribed principally to treat narcolepsy, is undergoing assessment for other neuropsychiatric disorders and medical conditions.  to assess the effects of modafinil on fatigue, symptoms, attention, working memory, and executive functioning in schizophrenia patients treated with psychotropic medications.  in recent years, evidence suggests that modafinil may be useful for certain symptom domains of schizophrenia, especially for the negative and cognitive symptoms.  twenty-four patients with a dsm-iv diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder (10 men and 14 women) were randomly assigned to modafinil up to 200 mg a day (n = 13) or placebo (n = 11) as an adjunct therapy in an 8-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study.  this study was designed to investigate the effect of modafinil added to risperidone in patients with chronic schizophrenia in a double blind and randomized clinical trial.  modafinil is prescribed for the treatment of narcolepsy.  to our knowledge, we report the only case of modafinil induced psychosis in a patient with bipolar depression treated with both mood stabilizers and antipsychotics.  finally, the results suggest that modafinil should be tested as an adjunct for treating meth addiction.  case reports have been published demonstrating modafinil induced mania in bipolar patients and modafinil induced psychosis in schizophrenic patients.  modafinil (i.v.)  these data indicate that modafinil selectively improves neuropsychological task performance.  modafinil is a drug developed and used for the treatment of excessive lethargy.  modafinil selectively improves neuropsychological task performance in healthy volunteers, possibly through improved inhibitory control.  it has been postulated that modafinil might treat cognitive disruption in neuropsychiatric disorders.  modafinil is a mild psychostimulant used for the treatment of sleep and arousal-related disorders, and has been considered a pharmacotherapy for cocaine and amphetamine dependence; however, modafinil's mechanism of action is largely unclear.  modafinil, given i.p.  modafinil  is a central nervous system stimulant.  the present results indicate that modafinil evokes dopamine release from striatal neurons and is a psychostimulant that is pharmacologically similar to, but much less potent and efficacious than, amphetamine. ||| ",yes
Was saracatinib being considered as a treatment for Alzheimer's disease in November 2017?,"these data demonstrate a disease-modifying persistent benefit for saracatinib in a preclinincal alzheimer's model, and distinguish its action from that of memantine.  on 7 june, the fda approved aducanumab, the first new drug for alzheimer's disease in almost 20 years-and notably, the first drug with a putative disease-modifying mechanism for the treatment of this devastating disorder, namely the removal of β-amyloid (or aβ) plaques from the brain.  active amyloid-β (aβ) immunotherapy is under investigation to prevent or treat early alzheimer's disease (ad).  it was approved by the us food and drug administration for the treatment of alzheimer's disease (ad) on april 21, 2000.  the cholinesterase inhibitor rivastigmine is approved for the symptomatic treatment of mild to moderate alzheimer's disease (ad).  on 7 june 2021, the us fda approved aducanumab, a human igg1 anti-aβ monoclonal antibody selective for aβ aggregates, as the first disease-modifying treatment for ad.  the recent failure of semagacestat in two large phase iii studies questions the value of γ-secretase inhibitors in treating alzheimer's disease.  aducanumab is approved in the united states for the treatment of mild cognitive impairment or mild-dementia stage of ad.  the ""notch-sparing"" γ-secretase inhibitor (gsi) bms-708,163 (avagacestat) is currently in phase ii clinical trials for alzheimer's disease.  although interrupted, this trial provides an indication that abeta immunotherapy may be useful in alzheimer disease.  our novel, highly immunogenic aβ conjugate vaccine, mer5101, shows promise for improving aβ vaccine safety and efficacy and therefore, may be useful for preventing and/or treating early ad.  solanezumab is an anti-amyloid monoclonal antibody in clinical testing for treatment of alzheimer's disease (ad).  in this phase ii study (nct01677754), 542 patients with moderate dementia (mmse 13-20) on background acetylcholinesterase inhibitors with/without memantine were randomized (1:1:1) to sembragiline 1 mg, 5 mg, or placebo once daily orally for 52 weeks.  rivastigmine is a cholinesterase inhibitor, approved for the treatment of mild-to-moderate dementia of alzheimer's type.  the purpose of this review was to summarize the background on dementia of the alzheimer type and the pharmacokinetic properties, efficacy and tolerability profiles, clinical applications, adverse effects (aes), drug interactions, and pharmacoeconomics of rivastigmine.  to evaluate the long-term effectiveness of rivastigmine patch or capsule on mild to severe alzheimer's disease (ad).  this study assessed the short- and long-term effectiveness and safety of rivastigmine in patients with mild-to-moderate alzheimer's disease (ad) in a real-world clinical setting in taiwan.  sembragiline is a potent, selective, long-acting, and reversible mao-b inhibitor developed as a potential treatment for alzheimer's disease (ad).  on november 21, 2018, the fda approved glasdegib (daurismo; pfizer), a small-molecule hedgehog inhibitor, in combination with low-dose cytarabine (ldac) for treatment of newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (aml) in adults ≥ 75 years or with comorbidities that preclude use of intensive induction chemotherapy.  on november 21, 2018, the u.s. food and drug administration (fda) approved glasdegib in combination with low-dose cytarabine (ldac), for the treatment of newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (aml) in patients > 75 years old or who have comorbidities that would be prohibitive of intensive induction chemotherapy. ||| ",yes
Was tamoxifen tested for treatment of glioma patients?,"recent studies have indicated that tamoxifen might have a potential chemotherapeutic effect on glioma.  in the present study, we determined the chemotherapeutic action of tamoxifen on human glioma cell lines.  it has previously been shown that high-dose tamoxifen has cytotoxic activity against glioma cells, but whether this effect is drug specific or represents a general property of serms is unknown.  high-dose tamoxifen was recently reported as a novel treatment for patients with malignant gliomas who have failed standard therapies.  the antiestrogen drug tamoxifen, which is used extensively in the treatment of breast cancer, has also been reported to inhibit the proliferation of some estrogen receptor-negative cell lines, including malignant glioma in vitro.  to explore the possible role of tamoxifen in the treatment of malignant glioma, we have investigated its effects on cell growth and radiosensitivity in c6 glioma cells using a colony-forming assay and a tetrazolium-formazan growth rate assay.  only a minority of patients with malignant gliomas respond to continuous high-dose tamoxifen (tam) treatment.  in summary, our study suggests that tamoxifen might have a chemotherapeutic effect on temozolomide-resistant glioma through its direct action on mitochondrial complex i inhibition and could provide further evidence to support future clinical trials of tamoxifen for the treatment of glioblastoma.  in this study, we demonstrate that tamoxifen and cc-8490, a novel benzopyranone with serm activity, induce glioma cell apoptosis in a dose- and time-dependent manner.  moreover, administration of tamoxifen and cc-8490 suppresses tumor growth in vivo and extends animal survival in glioma xenograft models.  these findings demonstrate for the first time that a serm other than tamoxifen can induce glioma cell apoptosis in vitro and in vivo and that the clinical efficacy of serms for the treatment of malignant gliomas could potentially be enhanced by simultaneous inhibition of the nf-kappab pathway.  tamoxifen inhibits protein kinase c (pkc) in vitro and thus may regulate glioma cell growth by modulating intracellular signal transduction.  taken together, our results demonstrate a synergistic effect of tamoxifen with radiation on intracellular damage in c6 glioma cells, which may in part be due to the inhibition of protein kinase c, suggesting that tamoxifen serves as a useful agent in combination therapy of glioma.  tamoxifen is the leading therapeutic agent in the management of breast cancer.  tamoxifen is one of the most commonly used endocrine therapeutic agents for breast cancer.  tamoxifen, a member of the selective estrogen receptor modulator (serm) family, is widely used in the treatment of estrogen receptor (er)-expressing breast cancer.  tamoxifen, a selective estrogen receptor modulator, is widely used in the chemotherapy of estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer.  tgf-beta2 plasma levels of glioblastoma patients treated with 200 mg tam/day on a continuous basis and of control patients not treated with tam were measured by using an elisa.  in contrast to breast cancer patients, the clinical response to tam in glioblastoma patients is not reflected by changes of tgf-beta2 plasma levels.  recent studies suggest that tamoxifen may be effective not only for er‑positive but also for er‑negative cancer cases. ||| ",yes
is intense physical activity associated with longevity ?,"in this study, the relationship between moderate physical activity and longevity was investigated, taking into account age, gender, smoking habits, cohabitation status, body mass index, leg strength and balance, education level and cognitive function.  endurance exercise, including high-intensity training to improve cardiorespiratory fitness promotes longevity and slows down aging.  in an aging society, however, active life expectancy and maintenance of independence may be as important as effects of regular exercise on longevity.  robust epidemiological evidence exists that lifelong regular exercise contributes to longevity.  high levels of physical activity seem to positively influence health and cognition across the lifespan.  indeed, there is evidence to suggest that increasing exercise intensity in older adults may be associated with greater reductions in the risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality.  older people who increase or maintain their physical activity have lower mortality than those who remain sedentary.  older people who exercise regularly tent to be those at whom we marvel: they live longer, more vigorous, independent lives.  longitudinal mixed effects models were used to assess the effect of sport or exercise group membership on physical activity and longevity across a 14-year follow-up.  there is consolidated evidence that physical activity exerts beneficial effects on several chronic conditions and longevity, on the basis of its proposed biological effects, especially on lipid profiles.  objectives: moderate physical activity gains survival.  evidence, mainly from cross-sectional studies, suggests that physical activity is a potentially important modifiable factor associated with physical performance and strength in older age.  cox regression analyses were used to investigate the predictive value of physical activity on longevity.  to examine whether engaging in physical activity in the context of sport or exercise group membership can protect against age-related physical activity decline.  simply expending energy through any activity may influence survival in older adults.  physical activity plays an important role for achieving healthy aging by promoting independence and increasing the quality of life.  performing three to five times the recommended physical activity minimum reaches the maximal longevity benefit, that can be achieved.  the quality of life in old age is crucially dependent upon the ability to pursue a variety of physical activities.  exercise is associated with mortality benefits but simply expending energy through any activity in an individual's free-living environment may confer survival advantages.  meeting the currently recommended amounts of leisure time physical aerobic activity of moderate intensity of at least 150 min/week provides most of the longevity benefit. ||| ",yes
is pharmacological treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism effective in reducing cardiovascular events?,"previous studies suggested that subclinical hypothyroidism has a detrimental effect on cardiovascular risk factors, and that its effective treatment may have a beneficial impact on overall health.  the purpose of the present study was to examine a possible association between subclinical hypothyroidism and cardiovascular disease.  the role of subclinical hypothyroidism as risk factor for cardiovascular diseases is supported by recent meta-analysis.  the main purpose of this review and meta-analysis was to assess whether subclinical hypothyroidism treatment is of clinical relevance, based on cardiovascular risk parameters correction.  because the cardiovascular system is considered a main target for the action of thyroid hormone, we investigated whether subclinical hypothyroidism induces cardiovascular abnormalities.  subclinical hypothyroidism was a predictor of cardiovascular disease in males below 50 years with an odds ratio of 3.4 (95% confidence interval 1.6-6.8) for developing cardiovascular disease compared to euthyroid age-matched males.  early identification of patients with sub-clinical hypothyroidism may lead to early treatment and thereby favourable effect on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.  subclinical hypothyroidism has been associated with dyslipidemia, hypertension, and increased risk of coronary artery disease.  adverse cardiovascular effect of hypothyroidism has been identified in many studies.  subclinical hypothyroidism was present in 10.8% of participants and was associated with a greater age-adjusted prevalence of aortic atherosclerosis (odds ratio, 1.7 ) and myocardial infarction (odds ratio, 2.3 ).  subclinical hypothyroidism is associated with dyslipidemia and atherosclerosis.  the cardiovascular risk is increased in patients with overt hypothyroidism, and several potential cardiovascular risk factors were similarly reported in patients with subclinical hypothyroidism.  subclinical hypothyroidism has been associated with elevated cholesterol and increased risk for atherosclerosis, but data on the risk of coronary heart disease (chd) are conflicting.  these findings indicate that subclinical hypothyroidism affects diastolic function and that this abnormality may be reversed by l-t4 substitutive therapy.  subclinical hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism have been associated with cardiac dysfunction.  below 50 years of age cardiovascular disease was more frequent in males with subclinical hypothyroidism compared to euthyroid males.  our study demonstrates that patients with subclinical hypothyroidism have increased levels of triglycerides and signs of low-grade inflammation (raised c-reactive protein levels) and that subclinical hypothyroidism might be a risk factor for development of cardiovascular disease in younger males.  whether subclinical hypothyroidism and thyroid autoimmunity are also risk factors for cardiovascular disease is controversial.  subclinical hypothyroidism is a strong indicator of risk for atherosclerosis and myocardial infarction in elderly women.  overt hypothyroidism has been found to be associated with cardiovascular disease. ||| ",no
is there an increase in ultrasound comets after intense exercise?,"the ultrasound lung comets detected by chest sonography are a simple, noninvasive, semiquantitative sign of increased extravascular lung water.  ultrasound signal processing methods may help quantify lung ultrasound comets.  ultrasound lung comets were absent at baseline (day 2, altitude 1350 m, 1.06 +/- 1.3), increased progressively during the ascent (day 14, altitude 5130 m: 16.5 +/- 8; p < .001 vs. previous steps), and decreased at descent (day 20, altitude 1355 m: 2.9 +/- 1.7; p = nonsignificant vs. baseline).  lung ultrasound comets are ""comet-tail"" artifacts appearing in lung ultrasound images.  ultrasound lung comets (ulcs) detected by chest sonography are a simple, noninvasive, semiquantitative sign of increased extravascular lung water.  recently, ultrasound signals termed 'lung water comets' associated with pulmonary edema have been correlated with adverse clinical events in dialysis patients.  at individual patient analysis, ultrasound lung comets during ascent appeared in 15 of 18 subjects (83%) at 3440 m above sea level and in 18 of 18 subjects (100%) at 4790 m above sea level in the presence of normal left and right ventricular function and pulmonary artery systolic pressure rise (sea level = 24 +/- 5 mm hg vs. peak ascent = 42 +/- 11 mm hg, p < .001).  we used this algorithm in a pilot study in 20 stable dialysis outpatients to identify associations between ultrasound comets and clinical parameters including blood pressure (bp), percent blood volume reduction on dialysis (%bv), ejection fraction (ef), and ultrafiltration on dialysis (uf).  negative findings included ultrasound comets that did not change from beginning to end of dialysis (p = 0.756), and were not significantly correlated with single dialysis treatment uf (p = 0.522), subject body weight (p = 0.208), or bmi (p = 0.358).  the purpose of this study was to extrapolate past observations and demonstrate how comets or b-lines are artifactual images whose formation is linked to ultrasound interactions on discretely aerated tissues of variable density.  ultrasound lung comets (ulcs) consist of multiple comet tails originating from water-thickened interlobular septa.  ultrasound lung comets were evaluated on anterior chest at 28 predefined scanning sites.  ultrasound interstitial syndrome is an echographic pattern of the lung characterized by the presence of multiple acoustic artifacts called ""comets"" or b-lines.  chest sonography allows to estimate extravascular lung water, creating ultrasound lung comet-tail (ulc) artifacts.  to assess the feasibility and value of ultrasonic comet signs, we studied 121 consecutive hospitalized patients (43 women and 78 men; aged 67 +/- 12 years) admitted to our combined cardiology-pneumology department (including cardiac intensive care unit); the study was conducted with commercially available echocardiographic systems including a portable unit.  an ultrasound lung comet score showed a negative correlation with o(2) saturation (r = -.7; p < .0001).  various lung ultrasound (lus) scanning modalities have been proposed for the detection of b-lines, also referred to as ultrasound lung comets, which are an important indication of extravascular lung water at rest and after exercise stress echo (ese).  the ""comet-tail"" is an ultrasound sign detectable with ultrasound chest instruments; this sign consists of multiple comet-tails fanning out from the lung surface.  our data suggest that dna effects detected with the comet assay in leukocytes of humans after exercise are secondary effects that do not originate from oxidized dna bases and do not result in chromosome damage.  these comets fluctuate substantially during the ultrasound exam highlighting the need for objective quantitative measurement methods. ||| ",yes
