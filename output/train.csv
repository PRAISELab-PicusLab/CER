Has ATF4 transcription factor been linked to cancer and neoplastic transformation?,Yes,"The transcription factor Activating Transcription Factor 4 (ATF4) has been extensively linked to cancer and neoplastic transformation. ATF4, a member of the CREB protein family, is known to play a significant role in cancer progression and resistance to therapy. It has been reported that ATF4 expression is closely associated with the progression of many cancers, contributing to processes such as tumor growth, metastasis, and drug resistance. Furthermore, ATF4 has been shown to promote oncogene-induced neoplastic transformation by suppressing the expression of cellular senescence-associated genes. Overexpression of ATF4 in cancer cells, such as A549, has been found to significantly promote cancer cell growth and invasion. The total expression of ATF4 is often higher in cancer cells compared to normal cells. While the molecular mechanism of ATF4 in cancer is not fully understood, its role in promoting oncogenic transformation by suppressing cellular senescence pathways is well established.","it is well known that activating transcription factor 4 (atf4) expression is closely associated with progression of many cancers.  it has been reported that activating transcription factor 4 (atf4) increases the processes of tumor growth, metastasis and drug resistance.  here, we report that atf4 promotes oncogene-induced neoplastic transformation by suppressing the expression of cellular senescence-associated genes.  overexpression of atf4 in a549 cells significantly promoted cancer cell growth and invasion (p < 0.05).  elevated levels of atf4 were sufficient to suppress expression of these proteins and drive oncogenic transformation.  activating transcription factor 4 (atf4), an endoplasmic reticulum stress-inducible transcription factor, plays important roles in cancer progression and resistance to therapy.  in this study, we investigated the function of atf4 in non-small cell lung cancer and its molecular regulation.  activating transcription factor 4 (atf4) is a member of the camp response element binding (creb) protein family and has been reported to participate in cancer progression; however, its molecular mechanism is not fully understood.  activating transcription factor 2 (atf2), a member of the activator protein 1 (ap-1) transcription factor family, has been shown to be involved in the pathobiology of numerous cancers.  activating transcription factor 2 (atf2), a member of the activator protein 1 (ap-1) transcription factor family, has been shown to be involved in the pathobiology of numerous cancers.  it has been reported that the transcription factor activating enhancer-binding protein 4 (tfap4) is upregulated and associated with an aggressive phenotype in several cancers.  our findings define a central function for atf4 in promoting oncogenic transformation by suppressing a central pathway of cellular senescence.  we detected cytoplasmic and nuclear atf4 expression in lung cancer a549, h1299, and lk2 cells, and the total expression of atf4 was higher than that in hbe cells (p < 0.05).  many cancers overexpress atf4, a stress-induced transcription factor that promotes cell survival under hypoxic conditions and other stresses of the tumor microenvironment, but the potential contributions of atf4 to oncogenesis itself have been little explored.  t cell factor-4 (tcf-4) plays an important role in development and carcinogenesis.  activating transcription factor 2 (atf2) is a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, which has been shown to participate in the pathobiology of numerous cancers.  transcription factor activating enhancer binding protein 4 (tfap4) is an important regulator in the genesis and progression of human cancers.  recently, the role of tcf-4 has been described in colon cancer and other cancers.  increasing evidence suggests that tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 4 (traf4) is an oncogene which is frequently overexpressed in many human carcinomas.  tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 4 (traf4) is a gene whose expression is altered in cancers. ||| ",Yes
Is lambrolizumab effective for treatment of patients with melanoma ?,Yes,"The study evaluates the efficacy of pembrolizumab, also known as lambrolizumab, for the treatment of advanced/metastatic melanoma. The results indicate that treatment with lambrolizumab in patients with advanced melanoma, including those who had disease progression while receiving ipilimumab, resulted in a high rate of sustained tumor regression, with mainly grade 1 or 2 toxic effects. The study also mentions that lambrolizumab was administered intravenously at a dose of 10 mg per kilogram of body weight every 2 or 3 weeks or 2 mg per kilogram every 3 weeks in patients with advanced melanoma, both those who had received prior treatment with the immune checkpoint inhibitor ipilimumab and those who had not. The findings suggest that lambrolizumab is an effective treatment option for patients with advanced/metastatic melanoma.","this study evaluates the efficacy of pembrolizumab for the treatment of advanced/metastatic melanoma.  pembrolizumab monotherapy is a valuable option for the treatment of advanced/metastatic melanoma patients.  we tested the anti-pd-1 antibody lambrolizumab (previously known as mk-3475) in patients with advanced melanoma.  in patients with advanced melanoma, including those who had had disease progression while they had been receiving ipilimumab, treatment with lambrolizumab resulted in a high rate of sustained tumor regression, with mainly grade 1 or 2 toxic effects.  introduction: ipilimumab is effective in the treatment of metastatic malignant melanoma, but few biomarkers reliably predict treatment response.  we here report on a case of successful treatment with ipilimumab in dacarbazine-resistant metastatic malignant melanoma, including a review of the literature on the long-term treatment results.  we administered lambrolizumab intravenously at a dose of 10 mg per kilogram of body weight every 2 or 3 weeks or 2 mg per kilogram every 3 weeks in patients with advanced melanoma, both those who had received prior treatment with the immune checkpoint inhibitor ipilimumab and those who had not.  methods: patients were treated with ipilimumab for metastatic malignant melanoma.  ipilimumab, a novel immunotherapy, is the first treatment shown to improve survival in patients with metastatic melanoma in large randomized controlled studies.  in the last few years, melanoma treatment has been revolutionized by the development of immune checkpoint-blocking antibodies or immune checkpoint inhibitors including ipilimumab, vemurafenib, dabrafenib, trametinib, nivolumab, and pembrolizumab.  ipilimumab is an approved immunotherapy that has shown an overall survival benefit in patients with cutaneous metastatic melanoma in two phase iii trials.  the literature search was conducted in electronic databases for studies that evaluated the efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab either alone or in combination with other treatments advanced/metastatic melanoma patients.  as results of registrational trials might not answer all questions regarding safety and efficacy of ipilimumab in patients with advanced melanoma seen in daily clinical practice, the dermatologic cooperative oncology group conducted a phase ii study to assess the efficacy and safety of ipilimumab in patients with different subtypes of metastatic melanoma.  sixty-seven patients with metastatic melanoma who received pembrolizumab treatment in the context of a phase 1 study were included and screened for the emergence of vitiligo.  our findings indicate that onset of vitiligo-like leukoderma during melanoma treatment could be a marker of favorable outcome in patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors.  although development of immune checkpoint inhibitors has revolutionized the treatment of metastatic melanoma, more than a half of treated patients experience disease progression during therapy.  talimogene laherparepvec (t-vec) has demonstrated efficacy for unresectable melanoma.  here we present data on patients with pretreated metastatic cutaneous, mucosal and occult melanoma who received up to four cycles of ipilimumab administered at a dose of 3 mg/kg in 3 week intervals.  objective tumor response with regard to the occurrence of vitiligo in patients receiving pembrolizumab therapy.  this vitiligo-like leukoderma can also appear in melanoma patients undergoing immune therapies such as immune checkpoint inhibitors. ||| ",Yes
Does triiodothyronine play a regulatory role in insulin secretion from pancreas?,Yes,"Triiodothyronine (T3) has been found to have a direct regulatory role in insulin secretion from the pancreas. This is supported by the observation that T3 increases the expression of genes encoding for enzymes involved in the synthesis and secretion of insulin by pancreatic beta cells. Furthermore, T3 induced hyperthyroidism has been shown to cause significantly elevated basal and stimulated glucose and insulin levels in rats. The inhibition of glucose-induced insulin secretion from the pancreas is a specific effect of thyroid hormones, including T3. Additionally, T3 has been found to affect the kinetics of glucose-induced insulin secretion from the isolated perfused rat pancreas. The presence of functional thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) receptor subtype 1 in the pancreatic beta cells suggests that T3 may regulate pancreatic function through autocrine or paracrine mechanisms.","we evaluated its effect vs triiodothyronine (t3), on glucose-induced insulin secretion in ins-1e cells, a rat insulinoma line, and on human islets.  oral triiodothyronine is known to induce hypertension in laboratory rats, while triiodothyronine also increases the expression of genes encoding for enzymes involved in the synthesis and secretion of insulin by pancreatic beta cells.  the aim of our present study was to analyze how glucose and insulin affect trh secretion by the pancreatic islets.  triiodothyronine induced hyperthyroidism caused significantly elevated basal and stimulated glucose and insulin levels in rats.  l-triiodothyronine (l-t3) treatment as well as propylthiouracil (ptu) treatment decreased the immediate insulin secretory response of the pancreas slightly.  our hypothesis of free serum triiodothyronine as an intermediate factor in the insulin resistance syndrome is refuted by these data, but we identified free serum triiodothyronine concentrations as a new determinant of blood pressure, insulin production, and fasting insulin in healthy euthyroid subjects.  inhibition of glucose-induced insulin secretion from the pancreas is therefore a specific effect of thyroid hormones.  free serum triiodothyronine concentrations correlated, independent of age and gender, positively with systolic and diastolic blood pressure, insulin production and fasting insulin.  the objective of the present study was to assess the direct effect of 3,3',5-triiodothyronine (t3) on glucose transport and on the translocation of insulin-regulatable glucose transporter (glut4) in insulin-stimulated rat adipocytes.  the correlations of free serum triiodothyronine with blood pressure, insulin production and fasting insulin were independent of the waist:hip ratio and insulin sensitivity.  overall obesity is associated with elevated serum triiodothyronine concentrations and insulin resistance.  thyrotropin-releasing hormone (trh), originally isolated as a hypothalamic hormone, has been reported to be present and released from the pancreatic beta cells, affecting pancreatic functions.  thyrotropin-releasing hormone (trh), originally identified as a hypothalamic hormone, is expressed in the pancreas.  when changes in body weight, rectal temperature, plasma glucose, plasma cholesterol, and plasma butanol-extractable iodine (bei) in these rats were compared with the insulin secretory responses, it was evident that experimental hyperthyroidism results in decreased insulin release, whereas experimental hypothyroidism induces increased insulin secretion from the pancreas.  we investigated the hypothesis that central obesity and insulin resistance are linked with an increased blood pressure and insulin production through elevated free serum triiodothyronine concentrations.  hyperthyroidism, which was induced by administration of tri-iodothyronine (t3) to rats for 2, 5 or 10 days, increased fasting plasma concentrations of glucose, insulin and free fatty acids.  the influence of thyroid function on the kinetics of glucose-induced insulin secretion from the isolated perfused rat pancreas has been studied.  our present data showing that glucose stimulates and insulin inhibits pancreatic trh release are compatible with the possibility that this substance may play a role in glucoregulation.  this is the first description indicating the presence of functional trh receptor subtype 1 in the pancreatic beta cells, and our observations suggested the regulation of pancreatic function by trh through autocrine or paracrine mechanisms.  in conclusion, t2 and t3 have a direct regulatory role in insulin secretion, depending on their concentrations and the glucose level itself. ||| ",Yes
Are there canonical marks of active chromatin in developmentally regulated genes?,Yes,"The context suggests that there are canonical marks of active chromatin in developmentally regulated genes. These marks include high levels of histone H3 lysine 27 acetylation (H3K27ac) and strong depletion of H3K27 trimethylation (H3K27me3). These chromatin state signatures are associated with active developmental enhancers. Additionally, the presence of active enhancer marks in regions of open chromatin is indicative of active regulatory elements. The recruitment of chromatin regulators and the assignment of chromatin states to specific genomic loci are crucial for cell fate decisions and tissue and organ formation during development.","our results support a model in which chromatin marking is associated with the stable production of rna, whereas unmarked chromatin would permit rapid gene activation and deactivation during development.  there is growing evidence that genes that respond to environmental or developmental signals may possess distinct chromatin marks.  combinatorial associations between distinct chromatin domains, namely promoters and cis-regulatory elements, determine transcriptional status.  measurements of accessible chromatin are used extensively to identify genomic regulatory elements.  previous studies showed that different categories of active regulatory elements are in regions of open chromatin, and each category is associated with a specific subset of post-translationally marked histones.  specific chromatin characteristics, especially the modification status of the core histone proteins, are associated with active and inactive genes.  in the latter case, regulation by transcription factors would have a comparatively more important regulatory role than chromatin marks.  transcriptional activation or repression of developmentally regulated genes is often accomplished through tissue-specific chromatin architecture and dynamic localization between active transcription factories and repressive polycomb bodies.  these results suggest that the majority of inducible genes are primed for activation by having an active chromatin signature and promoter pol ii with or without ongoing elongation.  conversely, strong chromatin marking is related to transcriptional and post-transcriptional stability, an association that we also observe in mammals.  with chromatin accessibility facilitating transcription factor access to dna, the identification of regions of open chromatin sheds light both on the function of the regulatory elements and their evolution, thus allowing the recognition of potential cres.  the dramatic changes in gene expression required for development necessitate the establishment of cis-regulatory modules defined by regions of accessible chromatin.  gene activity in eukaryotes is in part regulated at the level of chromatin through the assembly of local chromatin states that are more or less permissive to transcription.  using h3k27ac and open chromatin profiles, we showed that 89% of immature mk (imk)-specific active regulatory regions are present in the most primitive hematopoietic cells, 46% of which contain active enhancer marks.  in this review, we summarize the mechanisms of transition between transcriptional status of developmental regulators, including complex processes for enhancer activation and promoter-enhancer association.  here i review recent discoveries that improve our understanding of the influence of chromatin structure on gene expression and i discuss their relevance to mechanisms of vertebrate development.  recent studies using mammalian cells showed that a chromatin state signature is associated with active developmental enhancers, defined by high levels of histone h3 lysine 27 acetylation (h3k27ac) and strong depletion of h3k27 trimethylation (h3k27me3).  the recruitment of chromatin regulators and the assignment of chromatin states to specific genomic loci are pivotal to cell fate decisions and tissue and organ formation during development.  in addition, we identified a subgroup of genes with active promoter chromatin marks and promoter pol ii but no evidence of elongation.  transcription factors control gene expression programs in the context of the chromatin structure of their target genes. ||| ",No

Is c-myc subject to regulation by the circadian clock?,Yes,"The expression of cell cycle genes, including c-myc, are under circadian control and could be directly regulated by the circadian transcriptional complex. The circadian clock plays a critical role in physiology and medicine by cyclically regulating the expression of numerous genes. The daily organization of most mammalian cellular functions is attributed to circadian regulation of clock-controlled protein expression, driven by daily cycles of cryptochrome-dependent transcriptional feedback repression. The molecular machinery that governs circadian rhythmicity comprises proteins whose interplay generates time-specific transcription of clock genes. The circadian clock facilitates a temporal coordination of most homeostatic activities and their synchronization with the environmental cycles of day and night. Therefore, it can be inferred that c-myc is subject to regulation by the circadian clock.","the expression of cell cycle genes such as wee1, cyclins, and c-myc are under circadian control and could be directly under the regulation of the circadian transcriptional complex.  the circadian clock regulates daily variations in physiologic processes.  clock-interacting protein, circadian (cipc), has been indicated as an additional negative-feedback regulator of the circadian clock in vitro, although its physiological roles in circadian clock are unknown.  post-translational regulation of clk/cyc has previously been shown to be crucial for clock function and accurate timing of circadian transcription.  the circadian clock plays a critical role in physiology and medicine by cyclically regulating the expression of numerous genes.  our observations showed that hulc was able to heighten the expression levels of clock and its downstream circadian oscillators, such as period circadian clock 1 and cryptochrome circadian clock 1, in hepatoma cells.  the circadian transcription factor clock exhibits a circadian oscillation in its phosphorylation levels.  the circadian clock co-ordinates physiology and behavior with the day/night cycle.  however, the underlying mechanism of circadian clock disruption in hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc) remains unclear.  importantly, we found that the circadian transcriptional repressors cryptochrome (cry) and period (per) showed an opposite effect on clock phosphorylation; cry impaired bmal1-dependent clock phosphorylation, whereas per protected the phosphorylation against cry.  circadian genes control most of the physiological functions including cell cycle.  the circadian clock regulates biological processes from gene expression to organism behavior in a precise, sustained rhythm that is generated at the unicellular level by coordinated function of interlocked transcriptional feedback loops and post-translational modifications of core clock proteins.  the daily organisation of most mammalian cellular functions is attributed to circadian regulation of clock-controlled protein expression, driven by daily cycles of cryptochrome-dependent transcriptional feedback repression.  the molecular machinery that governs circadian rhythmicity comprises proteins whose interplay generates time-specific transcription of clock genes.  the circadian clock facilitates a temporal coordination of most homeostatic activities and their synchronization with the environmental cycles of day and night.  this phosphorylation controls the nuclear-cytosolic translocation of clock and thus its ability to regulate circadian gene expression in peripheral tissues.  the circadian rhythm regulates numerous physiological activities, including sleep and wakefulness, behavior, immunity and metabolism.  in addition, clock directly bound to the promoter of il-23r in γ/δ+ t cells, and il-23r expression in the mouse skin was under circadian control.  circadian genes continue to gain attention as important transcriptional regulators with the potential to influence a variety of biological pathways, including many cancer-related processes.  circadian rhythm is a biological rhythm governing physiology and behavior with a period of ∼24 h. at the molecular level, circadian output is controlled by a molecular clock composed of positive and negative feedback loops in transcriptional and post-translational processes. ||| ",Yes
Is SUMOylation a post-translational modification in eukaryotes?,Yes,"Justification: SUMOylation is a post-translational modification in eukaryotes, involving the covalent attachment of a small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) to lysine residues in target proteins.

Do R-loops tend to form at sites of DNA replication?,Yes,"Justification: The context suggests that R-loops are formed when replicative forks collide with the transcriptional machinery, causing genomic instability. This implies that R-loops tend to form at sites of DNA replication. Furthermore, R-loops have been recognized as origins of replication, suggesting a strong association between R-loop formation and DNA replication. The context also mentions that R-loops are a major source of genome instability associated with transcription-induced replication stress, further supporting the notion that R-loops tend to form at sites of DNA replication.","r-loops are three-stranded structures that harbour an rna-dna hybrid and frequently form during transcription.  r-loops are non-b dna structures that form during transcription when the nascent rna anneals to the template dna strand forming a rna:dna hybrid.  r-loops are nucleic acid hybrids which form when an rna invades duplex dna to pair with its template sequence.  r loops form when transcripts hybridize to homologous dna on chromosomes, yielding a dna:rna hybrid and a displaced dna single strand.  r-loops are features of chromatin consisting of a strand of dna hybridized to rna, as well as the expelled complementary dna strand.  r-loops, consisting of an rna-dna hybrid and displaced single-stranded dna, are physiological structures that regulate various cellular processes occurring on chromatin.  in this review, we summarize recent results implicating r-loops as important regulators of cellular processes such as transcription termination, gene regulation, and dna repair.  r-loops are structures consisting of an rna-dna duplex and an unpaired dna strand.  r-loop formation occurs when the nascent rna hybridizes with the template dna strand behind the rna polymerase.  r-loops are prevalent three-stranded non-b dna structures composed of an rna-dna hybrid and a single strand of dna.  r-loops are formed when replicative forks collide with the transcriptional machinery and can cause genomic instability.  together, these studies provide a high-resolution map of r-loops and identify gene structure as a critical determinant of r-loop formation.  r-loops, which consist of a dna/rna hybrid and a displaced single-stranded dna (ssdna), are increasingly recognized as critical regulators of chromatin biology.  r-loops affect a wide range of cellular processes and their use as origins of replication was the first function attributed to them.  r-loops are common across many domains of life and cause dna damage in certain contexts.  in addition to their recognized roles in triggering dna double-strand breaks (dsbs), r-loops have recently been demonstrated to accumulate in cis to dsbs, especially those induced in transcriptionally active loci.  we found the location of promoter-associated r-loops is dependent on the presence of introns.  r-loops are a major source of genome instability associated with transcription-induced replication stress.  varied evidence indicates that dna replication occurs in replication foci organized upon the nm and that structural dna loops may correspond to the replicons in vivo.  r-loops are non-b dna structures with intriguing dual consequences for gene expression and genome stability. ||| ",Yes
Do proton pump inhibitors affect thyroxine absorption?,Yes,"Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) have been observed to interfere with the absorption of levothyroxine (LT4), a synthetic form of thyroxine. This is believed to occur due to the alteration of gastric pH by PPIs, which can affect the dissolution and ionization of LT4, leading to decreased absorption in the small intestine. The context provided mentions a study that aimed to assess the effect of concomitant use of LT4 and PPIs on thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels in patients with primary hypothyroidism. This suggests that the use of PPIs could potentially affect thyroxine absorption and, consequently, TSH levels.","to examine retrospectively the effect of proton pump inhibitors (ppis) on thyrotropin (thyroid-stimulating hormone or tsh) values in patients with hypothyroidism and normal tsh levels receiving levothyroxine (lt4) replacement therapy.  an increased need for thyroxine has also been observed in gastric disorders due to variations in drug dissolution and/or in its ionization status.  in rare instances, drugs or diseases affecting absorption of thyroxine or drugs that accelerate thyroxine metabolism can manifest in a similar fashion.  we studied the effects of three medications on thyroxine absorption in seven normal volunteers.  the aim of this study was to assess the effect of concomitant use of levothyroxine (lt4) and proton pump inhibitors (ppis) on thyroid-stimulating hormone (tsh) levels in patients with primary hypothyroidism.  amiodarone and propranolol have been known to inhibit the peripheral conversion of thyroxine (t4) to 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (t3) but their direct effect on the thyroid gland is not understood.  background: thyroxine absorption takes place at the small intestine level and several disorders affecting this intestinal tract lead to thyroxine malabsorption.  it is believed that gastric ph interferes in levothyroxine absorption.  to determine if propylthiouracil (ptu) inhibited extrathyroidal thyroxine (t4) to triiodothyronine (t3) conversion in man, ptu was administered to t4-treated hypothyroid patients and serial measurements of t4, t3, and thyrotropin (tsh) carried out.  serum thyroxine was measured at intervals over a 6-hour period following drug ingestion.  propylthiouracil (ptu) and methimazole (mmi) are the most commonly used antithyroid drugs.  in phase 2, the eight patients who received cholestyramine showed an additional decline in free thyroxine from weeks one to two, but the overall rate of decline in hormone levels was not different between the groups.  we conclude from both our in vitro and our in vivo studies that ptu and methylmercaptoimidazole have no inhibitory effect on thyroglobulin synthesis in rat thyroids and that such inhibition does not play a significant role in the antithyroid action of these drugs.  the available data suggest that these drugs may block the thyroid hormone synthesis by inhibiting the thyroid peroxidase (tpo) or diverting oxidized iodides away from thyroglobulin.  conclusions: in almost all hypothyroid patients with uc, the therapeutic dose of thyroxine is increased.  in 15 patients the serum thyroxine level fell low enough to raise the serum thyrotrophin; in all 15 the serum thyrotrophin rose when taking synthroid.  sevelamer hydrochloride and chromium picolinate each significantly (p < 0.05) decreased the area under the serum thyroxine concentration curve, while ezetimibe had no effect.  experiments were performed both in vivo and in vitro to test a previous proposal that part of the antithyroid action of the thioureylene drugs, propylthiouracil (ptu) and methylmercaptoimidazole, can be attributed to inhibition of thyroglobulin (tg) biosynthesis.  thus, the decreased bioavailability (lower serum thyroxine) and decreased biologic action (higher serum thyrotrophin) of synthroid were due to the lower content of thyroxine.  medications may sometimes interfere with the intestinal absorption of levothyroxine, primarily by forming an insoluble complex with the thyroid hormone in the intestinal lumen. ||| ",Yes
Is transcription-associated mutagenesis (TAM) related to gene expression levels?,Yes,"Transcription-associated mutagenesis (TAM) is indeed related to gene expression levels. High levels of transcription have been shown to correlate with augmented mutation frequency. This phenomenon has been observed in both human cells and yeast. The rate of point mutation in a gene increases with the expression level of the gene. This is due to the accumulation of spontaneous DNA lesions that enhance transcription-associated mutagenesis. Transcription factors, which regulate the expression of genes at the transcriptional level, can also contribute to this process. However, it is important to note that the association between transcription factors and cancers is largely dependent on the transcription regulatory activities rather than mRNA expression levels.","high transcription is associated with genetic instability, notably increased spontaneous mutation rates, which is a phenomenon termed transcription-associated-mutagenesis (tam).  high-levels of transcription through a gene stimulate spontaneous mutation rate, a phenomenon termed transcription-associated mutation (tam).  reporter gene assays have demonstrated both transcription-associated mutagenesis (tam) and transcription-coupled repair, but the net impact of transcription on mutation rate remains unclear, especially at the genomic scale.  transcription induces mutagenesis on both dna strands, indicating simultaneous actions of several tam mechanisms.  we explored whether transcription level affects spontaneous mutation rate in human cells.  furthermore, increased transcription level stimulates spontaneous mutation rate in yeast.  using this approach, we demonstrate that (i) high levels of transcription correlates with augmented mutation frequency, and (ii) mutation frequency is enhanced in nongrowing population cells deficient for deaminated (ung, ywql) and oxidized guanine (go) excision repair, strongly suggesting that accumulation of spontaneous dna lesions enhance transcription-associated mutagenesis.  these results indicate that transcription is overall mutagenic.  compelling evidence points to transcriptional processes as important factors contributing to stationary-phase associated mutagenesis.  in this study, we investigated tam using the chromosomal can1 gene under the transcriptional control of two strong and inducible promoters (pgal1 and ptet) in saccharomyces cerevisiae.  however, the association between transcription factors and cancers is largely dependent on the transcription regulatory activities rather than mrna expression levels.  using comparative genomics of related species as well as mutation accumulation lines, we show in yeast that the rate of point mutation in a gene increases with the expression level of the gene.  however, the question arises of whether a change in the level of transcription of a specific gene is caused by the transcription factor acting directly at the promoter of the gene or through regulation of other transcription factors working at the promoter.  these alterations in gene expression are likely to contribute to the phenotypic consequences of tetr expression.  transcription factors (tfs) regulate the expression of genes at the transcriptional level.  in many cancers, alteration of tfs results in aberrant activity of them without changing their gene expression level.  the transcription-associated increase in uv-c-induced mutagenesis appears independent of the integration site of the hprt minigene.  given their occurrences in repair-proficient cells, transcription-associated g→t and g→c events represent a novel type of transcription-associated mutagenesis in normal cells with potentially important implications for evolution and genetic disease.  to assess a potential role of dna damage in the tam events, we measured mutation rates and spectra in individual strains defective in the repair of specific dna lesions or null for the error-prone translesion dna polymerase zeta (pol zeta).  when measuring global transcript levels only, the effect of the perturbation  on its target genes is often obscured by delayed feedback and secondary effects until the changes are fully propagated. ||| ",Yes
Is long QT syndrome a cause for sudden cardiac death in athletes?,Yes,"Long QT Syndrome (LQTS) is a cause for sudden cardiac death in athletes. This inherited channelopathy is characterized by a prolonged QT interval on an electrocardiogram, which is indicative of delayed ventricular repolarization. The disorder is arrhythmogenic, often leading to Torsade de Pointes, a specific type of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia that can degenerate into ventricular fibrillation, causing sudden cardiac death. The condition is primarily caused by mutations in cardiac ion channels, which predispose young individuals, including athletes, to sudden cardiac death, often related to exercise. The prevalence of LQTS and its association with sudden cardiac death in athletes has been a significant concern, leading to increased publicity and recommendations for pre-participation screening.","long qt syndrome (lqts) is an inherited channelopathy which exposes athletes to a risk of sudden cardiac death.  long qt syndrome (lqts) is one of the most common cardiogenetic diseases that can lead to sudden cardiac death and is identified by qt interval prolongation on an ecg.  the congenital long qt syndrome (lqts) is caused by cardiac ion channel mutations, which predispose young individuals to sudden cardiac death often related to exercise.  the long qt syndrome (lqts) is an arrythmogenic disorder characterized by prolonged ventricular repolarization leading to torsade de pointes evident at electrocardiogram (ecg).  sudden cardiac death is the leading cause of death in athletes.  the aim of our study was to investigate whether qrs-st changes are markers of cardiac arrest (ca) of unexplained cause or sudden death in athletes.  sudden cardiac deaths in athletes are usually due to underlying cardiovascular disease.  sudden cardiac death (scd) is the leading cause of mortality in athletes during sport.  sudden cardiac death (scd) is the leading cause of mortality in athletes during sport.  sudden death in athletes can occur during sport activities and is presumably related to ventricular arrhythmias.  sudden death in athletes can occur during sport activities and is presumably related to ventricular arrhythmias.  sudden cardiac death  in competitive athletes is caused by a diverse set of cardiovascular diseases such as hypertrophic and dilated cardiomyopathy , myocarditis, coronary anomalies or even coronary artery disease.  sudden cardiac death in the young athlete is caused primarily by cardiomyopathies and nonatherosclerotic coronary artery abnormalities; in the mature athlete, the most prevalent cause of sudden cardiac death is atherosclerotic coronary disease.  sudden death in athletes occurs because of the existence of hidden cardiovascular disorders which, during effort, may jeopardize the electrical stability of the heart, triggering ventricular tachycardia and/or fibrillation.  sudden cardiac death in athletes is one of the most tragic health events seen both in our country and all over the world.  the issue of lqts and sports participation has received significant publicity due to reports of sudden death in young competitive athletes.  this article reviews causes of sudden cardiac death in young athletes and current recommendations for pre-participation screening.  this article reviews the pathophysiology, clinical characteristics, and management of lqts in the physically active and athletic population.  sudden cardiac death (scd) of young athletes is an unexpected and tragic event that could occur during sport activities and is frequently related to ventricular arrhythmias.  j wave and/or qrs slurring was found more frequently among athletes with cardiac arrest/sudden death than in control athletes. ||| ",Yes
Do circRNAs remain untranslated?,No,"Justification: The context suggests that a variety of circular RNAs (circRNAs) have been found to have translational functions, resulting in the generation of functional proteins. This indicates that not all circRNAs remain untranslated.

Are there conserved noncoding elements identified between genomes of human and teleosts?,Yes,"The context indicates that comparative genomics has identified a class of non-protein-coding genomic sequences that display a high degree of conservation between multiple organisms, including humans and teleosts. These conserved non-coding elements (CNEs) are often more conserved between vertebrate species than protein-coding exons. The human genome contains thousands of such non-coding sequences, which are hypothesized to mark the locations of cis-regulatory elements. Fish-mammal genomic comparisons have been particularly useful in identifying CNEs that are likely to be cis-regulatory in nature and function as tissue-specific enhancers associated with genes involved in transcriptional regulation of development. The context also mentions the identification of lamprey elements associated with 11 out of 13 human gene regions, further supporting the existence of conserved non-coding elements between humans and teleosts.","deeply conserved elements shared between humans and teleost fish predominantly flank genes active during morphogenesis and are enriched for positive transcriptional regulatory elements.  multi-species conserved non-coding elements occur in the vertebrate genome and are clustered in the vicinity of developmentally regulated genes.  conserved and ultra-conserved non-genic sequence elements (cngs, uces) between human and other mammalian genomes seem to constitute a heterogeneous group of functional sequences which likely have important biological function.  the human genome contains thousands of non-coding sequences that are often more conserved between vertebrate species than protein-coding exons.  we searched for conserved non-coding elements (cnes) at 13 human gene loci and identified lamprey elements associated with all but two of these gene regions.  highly conserved noncoding elements (cnes) constitute a significant proportion of the genomes of multicellular eukaryotes.  vertebrate genomes share numerous conserved non-coding elements, many of which function as enhancer elements and are hypothesised to be under evolutionary constraint due to a need to be bound by combinations of sequence-specific transcription factors.  however, such deeply conserved elements account for <1% of the conserved non-coding sequences in the human genome, which are predominantly mammalian.  comparative genomics has revealed a class of non-protein-coding genomic sequences that display an extraordinary degree of conservation between two or more organisms, regularly exceeding that found within protein-coding exons.  here, we used the ucsc alignment of the human genome against those of 11 mammalian and five nonmammalian vertebrates to identify and examine the extent of conservation of human microsatellites in vertebrate genomes.  in contrast, few such conserved elements can be detected between vertebrates and their closest invertebrate relatives.  cross-species dna sequence comparison is the primary method used to identify functional noncoding elements in human and other large genomes.  evolutionary conservation of noncoding sequences across diverse species may have functional significance, and these conserved sequences may be good candidates for regulatory elements.  conserved non-coding sequences in the human genome are approximately tenfold more abundant than known genes, and have been hypothesized to mark the locations of cis-regulatory elements.  a phylogenetic footprinting strategy was employed to identify noncoding conservation patterns of 39 human and bovine orthologous genes.  here, we searched for duplicated conserved noncoding elements in the human genome, using comparisons with fugu to select putative cis-regulatory sequences.  our results suggest genetic variation in (ultra-)conserved non-genic sequence elements which might alter functional properties.  several studies have demonstrated high levels of sequence conservation in noncoding dna compared between two species (e.g., human and mouse), and interpreted this conservation as evidence for functional constraints.  fish-mammal genomic comparisons have proved powerful in identifying conserved noncoding elements likely to be cis-regulatory in nature, and the majority of those tested in vivo have been shown to act as tissue-specific enhancers associated with genes involved in transcriptional regulation of development.  we identified 124 families of duplicated elements, each containing between two and five members, that are highly conserved within and between vertebrate genomes. ||| ",Yes

Instead, the context discusses the SLC16A11 gene in relation to Type 2 Diabetes, the SLC1A1 gene in relation to normal tension glaucoma, and the SLC22A2 gene in relation to serum creatinine. The SLC6A4 locus is discussed in relation to late-life depression, but not orthostatic intolerance. Therefore, based on the provided context, it cannot be concluded that the gene SLC6A2 is associated with orthostatic intolerance.","elucidation of potential genetic contributions to orthostatic intolerance may inform therapeutic management and identification of individuals at risk.  in this article, we review the available literature correlating autoimmunity with orthostatic intolerance syndromes.  solute carrier (slc) 16a11 has been reported as a risk gene for type 2 diabetes (t2d).  in this study we investigate whether slc1a1 is associated with normal tension glaucoma in japanese patients.  genome-wide association studies reported slc22a2 variants to be associated with serum creatinine.  we sought to identify families with inherited autonomic dysfunction manifest as symptomatic orthostatic intolerance to characterize mode of inheritance and clinical features.  our findings suggested that the slc6a4 locus play a minor role, if any, in the pathogenesis of late-life mdd.  therefore, we performed an association analysis between the slc16a11 genotype and t2d pathology.  six single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) were detected in the slc16a11 gene, and five of them formed a haplotype (5snp haplotype).  we genotyped 12 single-nucleotide polymorphisms in slc1a1.  orthostatic intolerance is defined as the provocation of symptoms upon standing, commonly caused by neurogenic orthostatic hypotension (oh) and postural tachycardia syndrome (pots), the etiology for which has not been fully uncovered yet.  the slc16a11 genotype affected the values of laboratory parameters for t2d, particularly of blood lipids.  as slc22a2 encodes the organic cation transporter 2 (oct2), the association might be due to an effect on tubular creatinine handling.  comprehensive pedigree analysis of 16 families (39 individuals with orthostatic intolerance and 40 individuals suspected of having orthostatic intolerance) demonstrated dominant transmission of autonomic dysfunction with incomplete penetrance.  genotyping and haplotype estimation of the three markers rs4795541, rs140701, and rs3813034 spanning a 39-kb block the slc6a4 locus.  the function of slc16a11 may be related to lipid metabolism.  orthostatic intolerance is a debilitating syndrome characterized by tachycardia on assumption of upright posture.  the aim of this study was to explore the possible involvement of the slc6a4 locus in patients with late-life mdd by means of a haplotype-tagged approach.  thus, slc22a2 is associated with phenotypes of net tubular creatinine secretion and esrd.  bioinformatic analysis demonstrated that slc6a8 is highly expressed in nsclc and is related to poor prognosis. ||| ",Yes
Does molindone affect body weight?,Yes,"The antipsychotic drug molindone has been observed to affect body weight, contrary to the common opinion that it does not lead to weight gain compared to other antipsychotics. In a retrospective review, molindone was tested in 9 hospitalized chronic schizophrenic patients, and an average weight loss of 7.6 kg was observed after 3 months of treatment, with most of the loss occurring during the first month. This suggests that molindone may have a weight-reducing property, as opposed to other psychotropic medications that are known to cause weight gain as a common side effect.","our results challenge the common opinion that molindone can be associated with a lack of weight gain compared to other antipsychotics.  a retrospective review was conducted to assess the effect of molindone on weight.  the weight-reducing property of molindone, a recently introduced antipsychotic drug, was tested in 9 hospitalized chronic schizophrenic patients.  the obvious side effect of this drug is weight gain.  mirtazapine, a widely used antidepressant, induces adverse metabolic effects such as an increase in body weight.  moxonidine decreased food intake throughout by 20% in obese rats (p<0.001) and by 8% in lean rats (p<0.001), and reduced weight gain that final body weight was 15% lower in obese (p<0.001) and 7% lower in lean (p<0.01) rats than their untreated controls.  there are limited data concerning its effect on weight or body mass index (bmi).  the antidepressant therapy with mirtazapine was associated with a significant increase in body weight, body fat mass, and leptin concentration.  fluoxetine is an anorexic agent known to reduce food intake and weight gain.  monthly weights and neuroleptic dosages during the first three months of psychiatric hospitalization were compared between matched groups of patients receiving molindone, a combination of molindone and other neuroleptics, or other neuroleptic drugs.  weight gain is a common side effect of psychotropic medications.  fluoxetine persistently suppressed food intake and weight gain during the experimental period.  there was an average weight loss of 7.6 kg after 3 months on molindone; most of the loss occurred during the first month.  in adult rats, naloxonazine and naloxone significantly reduced body weight (7% and 4%, respectively) and food intake (21% and 13%, respectively) over 14 days.  the mean +/- sd body weight increased from 63.6 +/- 13.1 kg to 66.6 +/- 11.9 kg during mirtazapine treatment (p = .027).  these effects in adipogenesis by pimozide may help to explain the weight gain that is frequently observed in patients treated with pimozide.  the antihypertensive agent moxonidine, an imidazoline ii-receptor agonist, also induces hypophagia and lowers body weight in the obese spontaneously hypertensive rat, but the central mediation of this action and the neuronal pathways that moxonidine may interact with are not known.  the aim of this study was to investigate the influence of mirtazapine treatment on body weight, body fat mass, glucose metabolism, lipoprotein profile, and leptin and its soluble receptor in a prospective, controlled study design.  melperone did not result in significant increases in bmi.  these effects were more pronounced in adolescent rats where naloxonazine and naloxone significantly reduced the gain in body-weight (53% and 33%, respectively) and food intake (24% and 15%, respectively) over 14 days. ||| ",Yes
Is there an association between c-reactive protein concentrations and outcomes of subarachnoid hemorrhage patients?,Yes,"Justification: The context suggests that there is an association between c-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations and outcomes of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) patients. Several studies have shown a correlation between CRP and mortality in spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage. Additionally, a review and meta-analysis investigated the associations of CRP with the occurrence of delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) and poor functional outcome after aneurysmal SAH. The study also suggests that h24-CRP may be a more reliable marker than initial CRP in predicting mortality in intracerebral hemorrhage. High-sensitivity CRP (hs-CRP) is a well-recognized biomarker of neurologic complications and clinical outcome of stroke patients. CRP is an inflammatory biomarker of inflammation and may reflect progression of vascular disease. However, the role and impact of systemic inflammatory response after aneurysmal SAH remain to be elucidated.","this study aimed to examine prospectively whether the inflammatory marker c-reactive protein (crp) increases in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage (asah) treated by endovascular coiling and investigate whether crp could be used as prognostic factor for long-term neurological outcome.  several studies showed a correlation between c-reactive protein and mortality in spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage.  this review and meta-analysis investigated associations of systemic inflammatory marker c-reactive protein (crp) and white blood cell count (wbc) with occurrence of delayed cerebral ischemia (dci) and poor functional outcome after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (asah).  cytokines and cytokine receptor concentrations increase in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (csf) of patients following subarachnoid haemorrhage (sah).  activation of the inflammatory generating complement system might play a pathogenic role in spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage (sah).  this study suggests that h24-c-reactive protein may be a more reliable marker than initial c-reactive protein in the prediction of mortality in intracerebral hemorrhage.  to assess the time course and correlation of systemic inflammatory parameters with outcome and the occurrence of delayed ischemic neurological deficits (dinds) after subarachnoid hemorrhage.  besides the baseline characteristics, daily interleukin-6 (il-6), procalcitonin, c-reactive protein levels, and leukocyte counts were prospectively measured until day 14 after subarachnoid hemorrhage.  the purpose of this study was to determine if initial or h24-c-reactive protein is independently associated with 30-day mortality in intracerebral hemorrhage.  il-6csf seems to be a reliable early marker for predicting vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage on days 3 after treatment before clinical onset.  we analyzed both daily clinical manifestation and laboratory data of csf in 46 patients who suffered from intracranial aneurismal subarachnoid hemorrhage during a period of 14 days, studied the relationship between the development of vasospasm and the quantities of the inflammatory factor, revealing potential power of il-6 for predicting vasospasm detected by transcranial doppler (tcd).  although plasma c-reactive protein (crp) is elevated in response to inflammation caused by brain infarction, the association of crp with clinical outcomes after acute ischemic stroke remains uncertain.  only h24-c-reactive protein, hematoma volume, and infratentorial origin were independently associated with 30-day mortality in intracerebral hemorrhage.  the goal of this study was to explore whether the levels of soluble adhesion molecules were elevated in cerebrospinal fluid (csf) after subarachnoid hemorrhage (sah).  high-sensitivity c-reactive protein (hs-crp) is a well-recognized biomarker of neurologic complications and clinical outcome of stroke patients.  early cerebral hypoperfusion and ischemia occur after subarachnoid hemorrhage (sah) and influence clinical prognosis.  aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (asah) patients have an inflammatory response in the cerebrospinal fluid (csf).  high-sensitivity c-reactive protein (hs-crp) as a prognostic factor of stroke has been proposed and studied.  c-reactive protein (crp) is an inflammatory biomarker of inflammation and may reflect progression of vascular disease.  the role and impact of systemic inflammatory response after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage remain to be elucidated. ||| ",Yes
Is microRNA(miRNA) 30 involved in post-ischemic cardiac remodeling?,Yes,"The context indicates that microRNA-30 (miR-30) is involved in post-ischemic cardiac remodeling. Specifically, miR-30d is implicated as a biomarker in left ventricular remodeling and clinical outcomes in heart failure patients. Furthermore, studies have shown that miR-30d gain of function improves cardiac function, decreases myocardial fibrosis, and attenuates cardiomyocyte apoptosis in rat and mouse models of ischemic heart failure. Additionally, miR-30e has been found to alleviate cardiac function damage and promote ventricular remodeling via sox9 repression. These findings suggest that miR-30 plays a significant role in post-ischemic cardiac remodeling.","micrornas (mirnas) have been found to act as key regulators in the pathogenesis of myocardial ischemic-reperfusion (i/r) injury.  micrornas (mirnas) have been reported to be implicated in the progression of cardiac fibrosis, but the functions and mechanisms of mir-30b-5p and mir-22-3p remain to be investigated.  micrornas (mirnas) are implicated in the regulation of pathological and physiological processes in myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (mi/r).  micrornas (mirnas) play an important role in the pathogenesis of structural alterations of the failing heart through their ability to regulate negatively the expression levels of genes that govern the process of adaptive and maladaptive cardiac remodelling.  rationale: previous translational studies implicate plasma extracellular microrna-30d (mir-30d) as a biomarker in left ventricular (lv) remodeling and clinical outcome in heart failure (hf) patients, though precise mechanisms remain obscure.  micrornas (mirnas) are critical regulatory factors in myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (i/r) injury.  mirna-30c is differentially expressed in the heart during the progression towards heart failure and in vitro studies hint to its importance in cellular physiology.  in the chronic phase of ischemic remodeling, lower expression of mir-30d in the heart and plasma evs is associated with adverse remodeling in rodent models and human subjects, and is linked to whole blood expression of genes implicated in fibrosis and inflammation, consistent with observations in model systems.  mir-30e attenuated iso-induced cardiac dysfunction and cardiac fibrosis in a rat cardiac remodeling model.  it is concluded that mir-30e elevation alleviated cardiac function damage and promoted ventricular remodeling via sox9 repression.  we thus establish an in vivo role for mirna-30c in cardiac physiology, particularly in mitochondrial function.  the aim of the present study was to determine the cardioprotective mechanisms by which micro (mi)rna-30e protects the heart from myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury (mi/r) and to explore the signaling pathways that may confer protection for the heart and be potential therapeutic targets.  micrornas play important roles in regulation of the cardiovascular system.  mechanistically, mir-30e suppressed snai1/tgf-β pathway which was involved in iso-induced cardiac remodeling.  methods and results: in rat and mouse models of ischemic hf, we show that mir-30d gain of function (genetic, lentivirus or agomir-mediated) improves cardiac function, decreases myocardial fibrosis, and attenuates cardiomyocyte (cm) apoptosis.  although few micrornas (mirnas) have been involved in the regulation of post-ischemic cardiac fibrosis, the exact effect and underlying mechanism of mirnas in cardiac fibrosis remains unclear.  as little is known about the in vivo function of mirna-30c in the heart, we generated transgenic mice that specifically overexpress mirna-30c in cardiomyocytes.  at present, studies have focused on micrornas (mirnas) in myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury (mi/ri).  here, we sought to investigate whether microrna-34 (mir-34) plays a role in the pathogenic development of myocardial fibrosis.  functional studies elucidated that forced expression of mir-30c-5p in rats effectively reduced infarct area, cardiac apoptosis, oxidative stress and inflammation induced by myocardial i/r injury. ||| ",Yes
Is Alu hypomethylation associated with breast cancer?,Yes,"The findings suggest that leukocyte DNA hypomethylation is independently associated with the development of breast cancer. Global DNA hypomethylation, which includes Alu hypomethylation, is a hallmark of cancer in humans and a major event for the development and progression of cancer. In the context of breast cancer, Alu hypomethylation may result in chromosomal instability and oncogene activation, and as a surrogate of systemic methylation activity, may be associated with breast cancer risk. However, it is important to note that widespread hypomethylation and regional hypermethylation do not appear to be involved in the early stages of breast cancer and do not account for the molecular heterogeneity of the disease. Nonetheless, the detection of Alu hypomethylation in serum may be clinically useful for the diagnosis and prognosis of cancer, including breast cancer.","these findings suggest that leukocyte dna hypomethylation is independently associated with development of breast cancer.  distant metastatic dtc, pdtc, and atc were increasingly affected by global alu hypomethylation, suggesting that this epigenetic entity may be involved in thyroid cancer progression and dedifferentiation.  alu hypomethylation was similar between distant metastases and matched primary tumors.  global dna hypomethylation may result in chromosomal instability and oncogene activation, and as a surrogate of systemic methylation activity, may be associated with breast cancer risk.  within distant metastatic dtc, alu hypomethylation was increased in braf vs ras mutated tumors.  the median alu methylation level in tumor samples was 40.30 % (iqr, 36.80-54.20 %), which shows the correlation of alu hypomethylation between tumor and serum samples (r = 0.882) in the study group.  global genomic hypomethylation is a hallmark of cancer in humans.  in the present study, the feasibility of measuring hypomethylation of alu elements (alu) in serum and its clinical utility were investigated.  tumor tissues and matched serum specimens from 65 glioma patients and serum samples from 30 healthy controls were examined for alu hypomethylation by bisulfite sequencing.  therefore, as opposed to other cancer types, widespread hypomethylation and regional hypermethylation do not appear to be involved in the early stages of breast cancer and does not account for the molecular heterogeneity of the disease.  our results indicate that the detection of alu hypomethylation in serum may be clinically useful for the diagnosis and prognosis of glioma.  genome-wide dna hypomethylation is an early event in the carcinogenic process.  global dna hypomethylation is a major event for the development and progression of cancer, although the significance in thyroid cancer remains unclear.  kaplan-meier and cox regression analyses showed that thyroid cancer-related and all-cause mortality were associated with tumor hypomethylation, but this association was lost after adjustment for thyroid cancer risk category.  widespread hypomethylation of dna and regional hypermethylation, including tumor suppressor regions, have been demonstrated in several human cancers.  global hypomethylation of alu repeats was used as a surrogate marker for dna global hypomethylation, and was assessed using the quantification of unmethylated alu technique.  aberrant dna methylation has been recognized to contribute to breast carcinogenesis, and promoter hypermethylation of several tumor suppressor genes has been correlated with decreased gene expression.  an increasing hypomethylation was found for distant metastatic dtc  and pdtc/atc (median, 9.3; iqr, 7.0 to 12.1) as compared with normal thyroid tissue (median, 2.75; iqr, 2.30 to 3.15), whereas low-risk and pediatric dtc were not affected by hypomethylation.  hypomethylation of line-1 elements has emerged as a distinguishing feature in human cancers.  however, low methionine intake appeared more likely to be associated with tumors with unknown methylation status and high level of alcohol consumption seemed more likely to be related to tumors with un-methylated genes. ||| ",Yes
Are defects in recombination repair involved in carcinogenesis?,Yes,"The context suggests that defects in DNA repair pathways, including recombination repair, are associated with carcinogenesis. Recombination repair is one of the six major DNA repair pathways, and its deficiency can lead to genetic instability and carcinogenesis. The context also mentions that a clinically significant fraction of cancers have acquired DNA repair defects, and that inactivation of DNA repair pathways can initiate and accelerate the neoplastic process. Therefore, it can be inferred that defects in recombination repair are involved in carcinogenesis.","cancer cells are often defective in one of six major dna repair pathways, namely: mismatch repair, base excision repair, nucleotide excision repair, homologous recombination, nonhomologous endjoining and translesion synthesis.  although disruption of dna repair capacity is unquestionably associated with cancer susceptibility in humans and model organisms, it remains unclear if the inherent tumor phenotypes of dna repair deficiency syndromes can be regulated by manipulating dna repair pathways.  common polymorphisms in dna repair genes may alter protein function and an individual's capacity to repair damaged dna; deficits in repair capacity may lead to genetic instability and carcinogenesis.  defects of mismatch repair are thought to be responsible for carcinogenesis in hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer and about 15% of sporadic colon cancers.  until recently, only two repair pathways, postreplicative mismatch repair and nucleotide excision repair, have been linked to cancer in mammals, but these have been joined in recent months also by the damage-reversal and base-excision-repair processes, which have been shown to be inactivated, either through mutation or epigenetically, in human cancer.  it now appears that a clinically significant fraction of cancers have acquired dna repair defects.  defects in the dna mismatch repair process dramatically increase the risk for specific types of cancer because of instability in microsatellite dna sequences.  a polymorphic variant of excision repair cross-complementation group 1 (ercc1) (the dna repair gene) may be associated with carcinogenesis due to reduced dna repair capacity.  participation of dna repair systems in the pathogenesis of cancer has been a suspected phenomenon for a long time.  to establish our overall understanding of possible in vivo relationships between dna repair polymorphisms and the development of cancer, we performed a literature review of epidemiological studies that assessed associations between such polymorphisms and risk of cancer.  defects in cloned dna repair genes are now associated with particular human disorders in which an important feature is a predisposition to cancer.  hereditary and sporadic cancers in various tissues have been reported to have mutations at the dna repair genes.  it has been suggested that inactivation of dna repair pathways, which leads to an increased mutation rate and chromosomal instability, can initiate and accelerate the neoplastic process.  various dna alterations by environmental or endogenous carcinogens, if not repaired, can cause genetic mutagenesis, resulting in carcinogenesis.  dna repair is a double-edged sword in lung carcinogenesis.  decreased efficiency in dna repair translates to their ability to fix and consequently leads to mutations and the process of carcinogenesis.  deficiency in dna repair capability is considered to be responsible for oncogenesis.  it is generally known that replication errors (rers) at microsatellite loci detected in human malignancies reflect a genetic instability that is caused by abnormalities of dna mismatch repair system and underlie human carcinogenesis.  human cancers exhibit genomic instability and an increased mutation rate due to underlying defects in dna repair.  defects in dna repair can result in oncogenic genomic instability. ||| ",Yes
Can acupuncture cause spinal epidural hematoma?,Yes,"Justification: The context provided indicates that spinal epidural hematoma (SEH) is a rare but possible complication of acupuncture. While acupuncture is generally considered a safe and common treatment, it can be complicated by serious adverse effects, including SEH. The onset of severe spinal pain after acupuncture treatment should raise suspicion of SEH, and a spinal MRI should be carried out. The context also mentions several documented cases of SEH occurring after acupuncture and other pain control procedures. Therefore, it is established that acupuncture can cause spinal epidural hematoma.","in this report we compare our case of an extremely uncommon spinal epidural hematoma, which appeared after treatment by acupuncture, with other similar documented cases.  although a post-acupuncture spinal epidural hematoma (paseh) is very rare, there are only 6 documented cases, it is a possible complication from acupuncture on the back.  spinal acupuncture is a relatively safe and common analgesic treatment, but it may be complicated by serious adverse effects, such as direct spinal cord and nerve root injury, subdural empyema, and epidural abscesses.  the authors report the case of a 64-year-old woman who experienced thoracic epidural hematoma during a session of spinal manipulation therapy (smt).  this study reports a case of epidural hematoma that occurred in the anterior spinal cord after cervical massage.  we present the first report of spinal epidural hematoma occurring after chiropractic manipulation in a healthy young adult without preexisting cervical disease or any obvious predisposing factors.  spinal epidural hematoma is a rare but potentially devastating complication of spinal manipulation therapy.  this case represents the first spinal epidural hematoma occurring after a chiropractic manipulation in the lumbar region.  this study reports a case of thoracic spinal epidural hematoma following spinal manipulative therapy in the absence of predisposing factors.  spinal epidural hematoma is a rare complication associated with pain control procedures such as facet block, acupuncture, epidural injection, etc.  spinal epidural hematoma after spinal puncture such as for injection of steroids for pain management may result in a rare complication of a spinal epidural hematoma causing acute myelopathy.  this is a case report of a healthy pregnant female who presented to the emergency department with a cervical epidural hematoma resulting from chiropractic spinal manipulation therapy that responded to conservative treatment rather than the more common route of surgical management.  the onset of severe spinal pain after spinal or paraspinal acupuncture treatment should lead to the suspicion of a paseh, and a spinal mri should be carried out.  spinal epidural hematoma is a rare complication of chiropractic manipulation.  herein, we report on a patient who developed a lumbar epidural hematoma after receiving caudal epidural prf stimulation.  spinal epidural hematoma is a rare, but potentially devastating, consequence of accessing the epidural space for anesthesia or interventional pain procedures.  this case report presents the development of an epidural hematoma after lumbar transforaminal epidural steroid injection in a patient who has anatomical risk factor of severe lumbar spinal stenosis.  complications of smt are reviewed, and the etiology and features of spinal epidural hematoma are discussed.  we report four patients with epidural hematoma developed after pain control procedures.  this is the first reported case of aspirin leading to an epidural hematoma following an interventional chronic pain procedure. ||| ",Yes
Is the Miller-Fisher syndrome considered to be a variant of Guillain-Barré?,Yes,"The Miller-Fisher syndrome (MFS) is indeed considered a variant of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS).

Are conserved noncoding elements associated with the evolution of animal body plans?,Yes,"The evidence suggests that conserved non-coding elements (CNEs) are indeed associated with the evolution of animal body plans. CNEs are found to be enriched in genes involved in vertebrate development and are thought to play a key role in morphological and physiological diversity across animals. They are part of the core gene regulatory networks (GRNs) that specify alternative animal body plans and have fundamental roles in creating vertebrate body plans. The strong conservation of these sequences may affect the evolution of the surrounding genome, both by repressing rearrangement and possibly by promoting duplicate gene retention. The discovery that most regulatory genes were conserved among animals from distant phyla challenged the ideas that gene duplication and divergence of homologous coding sequences were the basis for major morphological changes in metazoan evolution. Given that many developmental processes are strikingly similar across all backboned animals, it is reasonable to expect these sequences to be conserved at the nucleotide level, their potential for mutation being constrained by their function.","our results indicate that conserved non-coding elements (cnes) consist of blocks with distinct evolutionary history, each having been frozen since different evolutionary era along the vertebrate lineage.  here, we use a new computational method to identify phylogenetically conserved noncoding elements (pcnes) in a manner that is not biased by rearrangement and duplication.  genes involved in vertebrate development are unusually enriched for highly conserved non-coding sequence elements.  the genomes of vertebrates, flies, and nematodes contain highly conserved noncoding elements (cnes).  recent evidence supports the proposal that the observed diversity of animal body plans has been produced through alterations to the complexity of the regulatory genome rather than increases in the protein-coding content of a genome.  gene regulatory changes drive animal development and play major roles during evolution of animal body plans.  distantly related animals have spectacularly different shapes and body plans, which can render it difficult to understand which of their body parts may have a shared evolutionary origin.  evolutionary changes in cis-regulatory elements are thought to play a key role in morphological and physiological diversity across animals.  evolution of animal body plans occurs with changes in the encoded genomic programs that direct development, by alterations in the structure of encoded developmental gene-regulatory networks (grns).  due to the subsequent stability of animal body plans, these core regulatory sequences have been evolving in parallel under strong purifying selection in different animal groups.  most of them were also conserved among vertebrates.  it is now clear that animal genomes are predominantly non-protein-coding, and that these sequences encode a wide array of rna transcripts and other regulatory elements that are fundamental to the development of complex life.  here, we discuss the evidence that cnes are part of the core gene regulatory networks (grns) that specify alternative animal body plans.  researchers have proposed that the strong conservation of these sequences may affect the evolution of the surrounding genome, both by repressing rearrangement, and possibly by promoting duplicate gene retention.  because they tend to be located in the flanking regions of developmental genes, they would have fundamental roles in creating vertebrate body plans.  data on nonbilaterian animals (sponges, cnidarians, and ctenophores) have suggested that antennapedia (antp) class homeobox genes played a crucial role in the early diversification of animal body plans.  the discovery that most regulatory genes were conserved among animals from distant phyla challenged the ideas that gene duplication and divergence of homologous coding sequences were the basis for major morphological changes in metazoan evolution.  non-coding rnas play roles in embryonic development of animals and these functions might be expected to evolve rapidly.  given that many developmental processes are strikingly similar across all backboned animals, it is reasonable to expect these sequences to be conserved at the nucleotide level, their potential for mutation being constrained by their function.  our results indicate that prototypical uces originated before the divergence of jawed and jawless vertebrates and have been frozen as perfect conserved sequences in the jawed vertebrate lineage. ||| ",Yes

The promoter regions and their characterization using CAGE are not discussed.","several genes have been implicated in rett syndrome (rtt) in its typical and variant forms.  mutations in this gene have been associated with rett syndrome, a form of autism.  a whole x chromosome study of families in which rett syndrome had been diagnosed in more than one member indicated that the region between xq27 and xqter was the most likely region to harbour a gene which may be involved in the aetiology of the disease.  rett syndrome (rtt) is an autism spectrum disorder caused by mutations in the x-linked gene encoding methyl-cpg binding protein 2 (mecp2).  the systematic screening of rett syndrome (rtt) patients for pathogenetic sequence variations has focused on three genes that have been associated with rtt or related clinical phenotypes, namely mecp2, cdkl5, and foxg1.  the x-linked neurological disorder rett syndrome (rtt) presents with autistic features and is caused primarily by mutations in a transcriptional regulator, methyl cpg-binding protein 2 (mecp2).  thirty-nine patients with classical rett syndrome, one with preserved speech variant (psv), and 12 patients with developmental delay and some features of rett syndrome were recruited for sequence analysis of the mecp2 gene coding region.  rett syndrome (rtt) is caused by mutations in the gene encoding methyl-cpg binding protein 2 (mecp2), an epigenetic regulator of mrna transcription.  rett syndrome (rtt) is caused by mutations in methyl-cpg-binding protein 2 (mecp2), but defects in a handful of other genes (e.g., cdkl5, foxg1, mef2c) can lead to presentations that resemble, but do not completely mirror, classical rtt.  a rett syndrome mutation with decreased protein expression was found to be associated with a conserved g-quadruplex.  furthermore, it has been demonstrated that rett syndrome, which is categorized into pervasive developmental disorders the same as the autism spectrum disorders are, is associated with mutations in mecp2 gene.  mutations in the coding sequence of the methyl-cpg-binding protein 2 gene (mecp2), which cause rett syndrome (rtt), have been found in male and female autistic subjects without, however, a causal relation having unequivocally been established.  rett syndrome and angelman syndrome are two neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by partial overlapping features.  an mecp2 mutation can be found in almost every patient with classical rett syndrome.  mutations in the gene coding for methyl-cpg-binding protein 2 (mecp2) cause rett syndrome (rtt) and have also been reported in a number of x-linked mental retardation syndromes.  found in 100% of the patients with classical rett syndrome originating from finland.  to evaluate whether environmental factors may influence the disease outcome of rett syndrome, we tested the effect of environmental enrichment from 4 weeks of age on the behavioural competence of mutant mice harboring a mecp2 (tm1tam)-null allele.  mutations in the coding region of the methyl-cpg-binding protein 2 ( mecp2) gene cause rett syndrome and have also been reported in a number of x-linked mental retardation syndromes.  we applied next-generation sequencing (ngs) to evaluate for mutations in known or new candidate genes in patients with variant forms of rett or rett-like phenotypes of unknown molecular aetiology.  the neuropathology of the rett syndrome is summarized utilizing a format of clinical pathological correlations, describing the pathology at specific anatomic sites which could correlate with the well defined clinical signs and symptoms in the rett syndrome; decreased head and body size, autism, gait dysfunction, spasticity, movement and breathing disorder. ||| ",Yes
Is there an association between Histone H3.3 mutations and glioma?,Yes,"The context indicates that recurrent somatic mutations of H3F3A in aggressive pediatric high-grade gliomas generate K27M or G34R/V mutant histone H3.3. Mutations of histone variant H3.3 are highly recurrent in childhood glioblastoma and in young adults with giant cell tumor of the bone (GCTB). The presence of mutant H3.3 histone disrupts epigenetic posttranslational modifications near genes involved in cancer processes and in brain function. Comprehensive molecular profiling of histone H3.3 mutant pediatric high-grade glioma has revealed extensive dysregulation of the chromatin landscape. Histone H3 G34R mutations occur in hemispheric high-grade gliomas and H3 K27M mutations occur in aggressive, though histologically diverse, midline gliomas.","mutations in histone h3 are key molecular drivers of pediatric and young adult high-grade gliomas.  mutations in the histone 3 variant h3.3 have been identified in one-third of pediatric glioblastomas (gbms), but not in adult tumors.  recurrent specific mutations in evolutionarily conserved histone 3 (h3) variants drive pediatric high-grade gliomas (hggs), but little is known about their downstream effects.  somatic mutations on h3 histone are currently considered a genetic hallmark for midline pediatric high-grade gliomas (hggs).  somatic mutations of the h3f3a and hist1h3b genes encoding the histone h3 variants, h3.3 and h3.1, were recently identified in high-grade gliomas arising in the thalamus, pons and spinal cord of children and young adults.  recently, distinct and recurrent mutations in a specific histone variant, histone h3.3, have been implicated in a high proportion of malignant pediatric brain cancers.  recurrent somatic mutations of h3f3a in aggressive pediatric high-grade gliomas generate k27m or g34r/v mutant histone h3.3.  mutations of histone variant h3.3 are highly recurrent in childhood glioblastoma and in young adults with giant cell tumor of the bone (gctb).  two recurrent mutations, k27m and g34r/v, in h3f3a, encoding non-canonical histone h3.3, are reported in pediatric and young adult gliomas, whereas g34w mutation is prevalent in bone tumors.  recurrent mutations at key lysine residues in the histone variant h3.3 are thought to play an etiologic role in the development of distinct subsets of pediatric gliomas and bone and cartilage cancers.  point mutations within the histone h3.3 are frequent in aggressive childhood brain tumors known as pediatric high-grade gliomas (phggs).  histone h3 point mutations have been identified in incurable pediatric brain cancers, but the mechanisms through which these mutations drive tumorigenesis are incompletely understood.  however, genome-wide sequencing of pediatric high-grade gliomas revealed somatic heterozygous mutations in the genes encoding histones h3.1 and h3.3, as well as mutations in the chromatin modifiers atrx and daxx.  here, we report 2 rare cases of histologically low-grade gliomas with gemistocytic morphology and sequencing-confirmed histone h3 g34r mutations.  histone h3 encoding genes, particularly h3f3a and h3f3b, the genes encoding the variant histone h3.3, are mutated at high frequency in pediatric brain and bone malignancies.  the presence of mutant h3.3 histone disrupts epigenetic posttranslational modifications near genes involved in cancer processes and in brain function.  while comprehensive molecular profiling of histone h3.3 mutant pediatric high-grade glioma has revealed extensive dysregulation of the chromatin landscape, the exact mechanisms driving tumor formation remain poorly understood.  here, we describe a series of 47 diffuse midline gliomas with histone h3-k27m mutation.  since histone modifications can lead to major epigenetic changes with direct impact on prognosis and treatment, we thought to investigate the occurrence of h3f3a k27m and g34r/v mutations in a cohort of pediatric tumors which included hggs, low-grade gliomas, ependymomas, medulloblastomas, and a series of rare brain tumor lesions of different histologies.  histone h3 g34r mutations occur in hemispheric high-grade gliomas and h3 k27m mutations occur in aggressive, though histologically diverse, midline gliomas. ||| ",Yes
Is signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT3) critical for tumor angiogenesis progression?,Yes,"Justification: The context indicates that Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 (STAT3) is constitutively activated in diverse human cancers and plays a critical role in tumor cell survival, proliferation, migration, invasion, angiogenesis, and inhibition of apoptosis. Previous studies have revealed that activation of STAT3 promotes tumor angiogenesis. STAT3 is involved in various cellular processes, including angiogenesis, and plays crucial roles in cell proliferation and survival, angiogenesis, tumor-promoting inflammation, and suppression of antitumor host immune response in the tumor microenvironment. Therefore, it can be inferred that STAT3 is critical for tumor angiogenesis progression.","signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (stat3) is constitutively activated in diverse human cancers and plays a critical role in tumor cell survival, proliferation, migration, invasion, angiogenesis, and inhibition of apoptosis.  signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (stat3) is constitutively activated in many different types of cancer and plays a pivotal role in tumor growth and metastasis.  overall, this review provides mechanistic insights for the roles of stat3 signaling in tumor angiogenesis.  the signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (stat-3) can facilitate cancer progression and metastasis by being constitutively active via various signaling.  previous studies revealed that activation of stat3 promotes tumor angiogenesis.  signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (stat3) is a transcription factor that is activated in diverse human tumors and may play a direct role in malignant transformation.  because signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (stat3) is constitutively activated in most human solid tumors and is involved in the proliferation, angiogenesis, immune evasion, and antiapoptosis of cancer cells, researchers have focused on stat3 as a target for cancer therapy.  activation of the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (stat3) is frequently detected in many cancer types.  stat3 plays an important role in tumor angiogenesis, immunity and tumor invasion and metastasis.  stat3 controls cell differentiation, proliferation, and survival, and is associated with angiogenesis and immune dysfunction during tumorigenesis.  signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (stat3) represent a transcription factor that is constitutively activated in various cancers.  signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (stat3) is persistently activated in a wide variety of epithelial cancers.  signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (stat3) have roles in various cellular processes, including angiogenesis, apoptosis, cell cycle progression, cell migration and drug resistance.  numerous studies have shown that stat3 plays crucial roles in cell proliferation and survival, angiogenesis, tumor-promoting inflammation, and suppression of antitumor host immune response in the tumor microenvironment.  activated stat3 may participate in oncogenesis by stimulating cell proliferation and resisting apoptosis, as well as promoting tumor angiogenesis, invasion, and migration.  it has been demonstrated that stat3 is constitutively activated in many tumors, playing a role in carcinogenesis and tumor progression.  as an oncogene, over-activated signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (stat3) has been detected in many tumors.  aberrant activation of the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (stat3) occurs in many human tumors.  the transcription factor signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (stat3) can promote cancer metastasis, but its underlying regulatory mechanisms in gastric cancer cell invasiveness still remain obscure.  it appears that, although stat3 is not absolutely required for tumor formation, tumors that develop in the presence of stat3 become dependent on its expression for their survival, making it a potential therapeutic target. ||| ",Yes
Are EDNRB mutations involved in the development of Hirschsprung disease?,Yes,"The endothelin-b receptor gene (EDNRB) has been identified as a susceptibility gene for Hirschsprung disease (HD). Novel EDNRB mutations have been detected in non-syndromic HD patients with heterozygous forms, and homozygous mutations of the EDNRB or the endothelin-3 (EDN3) genes have been reported in HD patients associated with type 2 Waardenburg syndrome. The preferential production of a null function EDNRB by RNA editing/splicing could be involved in the etiology of some cases of HD. The pathogenesis of HD is complex, and it might serve as a model for other complex disorders. The findings suggest that low-penetrance mutations would be necessary but not sufficient and the additional presence of the ""Hirschsprung disease haplotype"" could contribute to the manifestation of the disease.","the endothelin-b receptor gene (ednrb) and the endothelin-3 gene (edn3) have recently been recognized as susceptibility genes for hirschsprung's disease (hd).  to investigate the mutations of etb in hirschsprung disease, expression of the etb gene in lymphoblastoid cells from patients and normal healthy adults was examined, and novel mutant transcripts were found.  hirschsprung disease is a heterogeneous genetic disorder, causative genes of which include the endothelin b receptor (etb).  the pathogenesis of hirschsprung disease is complex.  the preferential production of this null function etb by rna editing/splicing could be involved in the etiology of some cases of hirschsprung disease.  hirschsprung disease with major and modifying sequence variants in a variety of genes might well serve as a model for the many complex disorders for which the search for genes involved has only just been initiated.  novel ednrb mutations have been detected in non-syndromic hd patients with heterozygous forms, and homozygous mutations of the ednrb or the edn3 genes have been reported in hd patients associated with type 2 waardenburg syndrome.  we aimed to assess the genetic background of hirschsprung disease using a genome-wide association analysis combined with sequencing all ret exons in samples from 105 hirschsprung disease cases (30 familial and 75 sporadic) and 386 controls.  the whole findings seem to suggest that low-penetrance mutations would be necessary but not sufficient and the additional presence of the ""hirschsprung disease haplotype"" could contribute to the manifestation of the disease.  traditional ret germline mutations account for a small subset of hirschsprung disease patients, but several studies have shown that there is a specific haplotype of ret associated with the sporadic forms of hirschsprung disease.  ret gene is the major gene causing hirschsprung's disease (hd).  of these, eight amino acid changing rare variants and two frameshift variants caused or possibly caused hirschsprung disease.  although the ret proto-oncogene is the most frequently affected gene in hirschsprung disease, rare coding sequence variants explain only a small part of hirschsprung disease cases.  mutations in the ret gene are the primary cause of hirschsprung disease (hscr), or congenital intestinal aganglionosis.  as expected, variants in or near ret showed the strongest overall association with hirschsprung disease and the most statistically significant association was observed when using a recessive genetic model (rs2435357, nc_000010.10:g.43582056t > c; genotype tt, or = 17.31, p = 1.462 × 10-21).  hirschsprung disease (hscr) is a congenital developmental defect of the enteric nervous system known to be associated with the ret-protooncogene and other candidates.  two patients with mutations in genes of the ednrb pathway also harbored a mutation in ret.  the ret proto-oncogene is considered to be the major susceptibility gene involved in hirschsprung disease.  background: hirschsprung's disease (hscr) is a heterogeneous congenital malformation of the enteric nervous system with a complex genetic etiology.  a significant over-transmission of the ""hirschsprung disease haplotype"" was detected when comparing transmitted versus nontransmitted alleles in the group of hirschsprung disease triads without mutation. ||| ",Yes
Could hypophosphatemic rickets cause craniosynostosis?,Yes,"Hypophosphatemic rickets, a condition characterized by defective renal phosphate reabsorption and abnormal bone mineralization, has been associated with craniosynostosis. This complication, often underdiagnosed, can develop in early infancy. The condition is linked to metabolic diseases, including rickets, which arises from a deficiency or impaired metabolism of vitamin D, magnesium, phosphorus, or calcium, leading to hypomineralization of the bone. In particular, X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets (XLH) can occasionally cause premature fusion of cranial sutures due to an increased level of fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23), which disrupts the regulation of phosphate and vitamin D metabolism.","craniosynostosis is an underdiagnosed complication of hypophosphatemic rickets.  craniosynostosis is an underdiagnosed complication associated with hypophosphatemic rickets.  hypophosphatemic rickets/osteomalacia is characterized by defective renal phosphate reabsorption and abnormal bone mineralization.  childhood hypophosphatemic rickets (hr) is most often caused by a defect in renal tubular resorption of filtered phosphorus.  there is a family history of genetically unconfirmed hypophosphatemic rickets in his mother.  familial hypophosphatemic rickets is characterized by defective skeletal mineralization resulting in abnormal growth and development.  in children, hypophosphatemic rickets (hr) is revealed by delayed walking, waddling gait, leg bowing, enlarged cartilages, bone pain, craniostenosis, spontaneous dental abscesses, and growth failure.  rickets and osteomalacia are associated with hypophosphatemia in several disease states, including x-linked hypophosphatemic rickets, autosomal-dominant hypophosphatemic rickets, and tumor-induced osteomalacia.  the study aims to describe the clinical and auxological characteristic of children with hypophosphatemic rickets and craniosynostosis, describe the usual treatment, and compare the characteristics with those of children without craniosynostosis.  our observations suggest that craniosynostosis secondary to rickets can develop in early infancy.  hypophosphatemia leads to rickets and osteomalacia, the latter of which results in decreased biomechanical integrity of bones, accompanied by poor fracture healing.  craniosynostosis can be gene-linked, or caused by metabolic diseases, such as rickets, which results from a deficiency or impaired metabolism of vitamin d, magnesium, phosphorus or calcium leading to hypomineralization of the bone.  targeted massively parallel resequencing of 196 candidate genes for hypophosphatemic rickets/osteomalacia was performed in the 86 affected unrelated individuals (cases) and in 100 unrelated healthy controls to identify new genes and mutations in known genes that cause hypophosphatemic rickets/osteomalacia.  x-linked hypophosphatemic rickets (xlhr) represents the most common form of genetic hypophosphatemia and causes rickets and osteomalacia in children because of increased fgf23 secretion and renal phosphate wasting.  here we describe a 29-year-old man with a history of childhood rickets who presented with increased renal phosphate clearance leading to hypophosphatemia, hypercalciuria, low serum parathyroid hormone (pth), elevated serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin d (1,25(oh)2d) and recurrent nephrolithiasis.  x-linked hypophosphatemic rickets (xlh) can occasionally cause premature fusion of cranial sutures through an increased level of fibroblast growth factor 23 (fgf-23), which leads to the dysregulation of phosphate and vitamin d metabolism.  rickets is a paradoxical complication of osteopetrosis resulting from the inability of the osteoclasts to maintain a normal calcium-phosphorus balance in the extracellular fluid.  we report on a boy who presented with hypophosphatemic rickets with elevated serum fibroblast growth factor 23 (fgf23) and polyostotic osteolytic lesions at age 2 years.  hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets with hypercalciuria (hhrh) is a new autosomal form of hypophosphatemic rickets, recently described.  a total of 86 hypophosphatemic rickets/osteomalacia patients (ranging from 3 to 70 years old) were recruited. ||| ",Yes
Can protein coding exons originate from ALU sequences?,Yes,"The study provides evidence for the translational activities of ALU exons and the presence of ALU exon-derived peptides in human proteins. More than 25% of ALU exons analyzed by RNA-seq have estimated transcript inclusion levels of at least 50% in the human cerebellum, indicating widespread establishment of ALU exons in human genes. The data indicate that ALU elements have contributed to the acquisition of novel protein sequences during primate and human evolution. In the case of the RNA editing enzyme ADAR1, which contains an ALU exon peptide in its catalytic domain, RNA sequencing analyses of A-to-I editing demonstrate that both the ALU exon skipping and inclusion isoforms encode active enzymes. These ALU exon peptides represent species-specific protein differences between primates and other mammals, and in certain instances between humans and closely related primates.","we investigated the creation and establishment of alu exons in human genes, using transcriptome profiles of human tissues generated by high-throughput rna sequencing (rna-seq) combined with extensive rt-pcr analysis.  thousands of human genes contain spliced exons derived from alu elements.  using rna sequencing, ribosome profiling, and proteomics data from human tissues and cell lines, we provide evidence for the translational activities of alu exons and the presence of alu exon derived peptides in human proteins.  more than 25% of alu exons analyzed by rna-seq have estimated transcript inclusion levels of at least 50% in the human cerebellum, indicating widespread establishment of alu exons in human genes.  we detected numerous further differences between alu exons and their non-exonizing counterparts, among others in terms of exon-intron architecture and strength of splicing signals, enhancers, and silencers.  moreover, the computationally derived probabilities of exonization significantly correlated with the biological inclusion level of the alu exons, and the model could also be extended to general datasets of constitutive and alternative exons.  alu elements are major contributors to lineage-specific new exons in primate and human genomes.  recent studies indicate that some alu exons have high transcript inclusion levels or tissue-specific splicing profiles, and may play important regulatory roles in modulating mrna degradation or translational efficiency.  the alu element has been a major source of new exons during primate evolution.  moreover, the preferential creation and establishment of alu exons in zinc finger genes suggest that alu exonization may have globally affected the evolution of primate and human transcriptomes by regulating the protein production of master transcriptional regulators in specific lineages.  to understand the molecular basis and the regulation of the process of turning intronic alus into new exons, we compiled and analyzed a data set of human exonized alus.  however, identifying alu exons that have acquired genuine biological functions remains a major challenge.  we adopt a proteotranscriptomics approach to systematically assess the contribution of alu exons to the human proteome.  the prevailing view is that exons derived from young repetitive elements, such as alu elements, are restricted to regulatory functions and have not had adequate evolutionary time to be incorporated into stable, functional proteins.  our data indicate that alu elements have contributed to the acquisition of novel protein sequences during primate and human evolution.  we identified and characterized numerous features used by the splicing machinery to discriminate between alu exons and their non-exonizing counterparts.  in the case of the rna editing enzyme adarb1, which contains an alu exon peptide in its catalytic domain, rna sequencing analyses of a-to-i editing demonstrate that both the alu exon skipping and inclusion isoforms encode active enzymes.  these alu exon peptides represent species-specific protein differences between primates and other mammals, and in certain instances between humans and closely related primates.  in this study, we analyzed alu exonization events, aiming to understand the requirements for correct selection of exons.  on the basis of these findings, we identified mutations that activated the exonization of a silent intronic alu. ||| ",Yes
Does the Abelson-related gene (ARG) gene encode for a serine kinase?,No,"The Abelson-related gene (ARG) does not encode for a serine kinase. Instead, it encodes for a non-receptor tyrosine protein kinase, which is a member of the Abelson family of protein-tyrosine kinases. The ARG gene codes for a protein that is highly related to c-abl in the tyrosine kinase, SH2, and SH3 domains. The ARG protein plays important roles in cell morphogenesis, motility, growth, and survival, and many of these biological roles overlap with the cellular functions of the abl kinase. However, ARG has no known function in cell signaling. The present studies demonstrate that ARG associates with the proapoptotic SIVA-1 protein, but there is no evidence that it functions as a serine kinase.","arg and c-abl represent the mammalian members of the abelson family of protein-tyrosine kinases.  the products of the human arg gene and the human abl gene characterize the abelson family of non-receptor tyrosine protein kinases.  arg and c-abl represent the mammalian member of the abelson family of nonreceptor protein tyrosine kinases.  the products of the human arg gene and human, mouse, drosophila, and nematode abl genes characterize the abelson family of nonreceptor tyrosine protein kinase.  the arg gene, expressed as a 12-kb transcript, codes a protein highly related to c-abl in the tyrosine kinase, sh2, and sh3 domains, and both proteins have a myristoylated isoform.  abl2/arg (abl-related gene) belongs to the abl (abelson tyrosine-protein kinase) family of tyrosine kinases.  abl2 (also known as arg (abl related gene)) is closely related to the well-studied abelson kinase cabl.  arg plays important roles in cell morphogenesis, motility, growth and survival, and many of these biological roles overlap with the cellular functions of the abl kinase.  the abl family of mammalian nonreceptor tyrosine kinases consists of c-abl and arg (abl-related gene).  previously, we have shown that in abelson-transformed cells, the abelson kinase regulates the phosphoserine content of ribosomal protein s6.  the abelson (c-abl) proto-oncogene encodes a highly conserved nonreceptor protein tyrosine kinase that plays a role in cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis and cell adhesion.  arg, however, has no known function in cell signaling.  argbp2 associates with and is a substrate of arg and v-abl, and is phosphorylated on tyrosine in v-abl-transformed cells.  we have investigated three models whereby the abelson kinase might regulate s6 phosphorylation via the activation of protein kinase c. first, the abelson kinase could phosphorylate protein kinase c on tyrosine.  the transforming protein of the abelson murine leukaemia virus encodes a protein-tyrosine kinase.  these observations indicate that the c-terminal domain regulates arg biological activity in a manner distinct from c-abl and suggest that this effect may be mediated in part by sh3 domain-binding sites.  a novel arg/abl-binding protein, argbp2, was isolated using a segment of the arg cooh-terminal domain as bait in the yeast two-hybrid system.  the present studies demonstrate that arg associates with the proapoptotic siva-1 protein.  this paper shows that the kinase domain of ark1 autophosphorylates on serine and threonine residues when expressed as a recombinant fusion protein.  argbp2 contains three cooh-terminal src homology 3 domains, a serine/threonine-rich domain, and several potential abl phosphorylation sites. ||| ",No
Is thrombophilia related to increased risk of miscarriage?,Yes,"Justification: The context suggests that both acquired and inherited thrombophilia are associated with an increased risk of pregnancy failure, including recurrent miscarriage.

The review discusses the evidence of association between thrombophilias and adverse pregnancy outcomes, including recurrent miscarriage, late fetal loss, and other vascular pregnancy complications. The role of thrombophilia in pregnancy failure is reviewed in terms of epidemiology, etiology, and potential therapeutic implications. The growing view is that inherited or acquired thrombophilia may predispose a woman towards an adverse pregnancy outcome.","both acquired and inherited thrombophilia is associated with an increased risk of pregnancy failure (i.e.  at present it seems that thrombophilia are associated with and may even cause some cases of pregnancy loss.  heritable thrombophilia is associated with an increased risk for pregnancy failure, defined as sporadic and recurrent miscarriage, late fetal loss, and other vascular pregnancy complications such as preeclampsia and intrauterine growth retardation.  this review discusses the evidence of association between thrombophilias and pregnancy outcome together with issues as to clinical management and preventive strategies.  women with recurrent fetal miscarriages have an increased incidence of thrombophilia.  inherited thrombophilias are the leading cause of maternal thromboembolism and are associated with an increased risk of recurrent spontaneous abortion (second- and third-trimester fetal loss).  the role of heritable thrombophilia in pregnancy failure is reviewed, with a focus on recurrent miscarriage, in terms of epidemiology, etiology, and potential therapeutic implications.  there is a growing view that inherited or acquired thrombophilia may predispose a woman towards an adverse pregnancy outcome.  inherited thrombophilia is associated with both poor obstetrical outcomes and increased cardiovascular risk later in life.  is there an association between hereditary thrombophilia in pregnant women and risk of recurrent pregnancy loss (rpl)?  both acquired and inherited thrombophilias are associated with an increased risk of pregnancy-related venous thromboembolism (vte) as well as with adverse pregnancy outcome.  the role of acquired thrombophilia has been accepted as an etiology of recurrent miscarriage (rm); however, the contribution of specific inherited thrombophilic genes to this disorder has remained controversial.  inherited and acquired thrombophilia are associated with recurrent pregnancy loss.  genetic thrombophilias may be one of the major etiological factors for recurrent abortion and fetal demise.  our purpose was to examine whether genetic thrombophilias are etiological factors for recurrent fetal miscarriage or not.  over the last decade, inherited thrombophilia is often referred as a possible cause of recurrent miscarriages and in vitro fertilisation (ivf) failure.  inherited and acquired thrombophilia have been found to be associated with recurrent pregnancy loss.  this finding suggests a possible association between this thrombophilic condition and early reproductive failures.  the genes involved in thrombophilia could be one reason for fertility complications in some women with unexplained infertility.  factor v leiden (fvl) and prothrombin g20210a (fiig20210a) mutations are associated with a higher risk of miscarriage: we sought to understand whether this association differs by clinical time of unexplained miscarriage, and by ethnic origin, among women with no previous thrombotic episode, during the first intended pregnancy. ||| ",Yes
Do Conserved noncoding elements act as enhancers?,Yes,"Conserved noncoding elements (CNEs) have been shown to act as developmental enhancers in vertebrate genomes. These elements exhibit extreme noncoding conservation in metazoan genomes and are a rich source for the discovery of gene regulatory regions, such as transcriptional enhancers. Recent studies have revealed that active enhancers are transcribed, producing a class of noncoding RNAs called enhancer RNAs (eRNAs). These eRNAs are thought to act as potent promoters of the expression of nearby genes through interaction with the transcriptional and epigenomic machineries. However, the functional role of these enhancer:non-coding RNA associations is still unclear. Despite this, the evidence suggests that CNEs do indeed act as enhancers.","enhancers are non-coding dna fragments which are crucial in gene regulation (e.g.  noncoding rnas (ncrnas) generated from enhancers have been proposed as a general facet of enhancer function and some have been shown to be required for enhancer activity.  conserved noncoding elements (cnes) in vertebrate genomes often act as developmental enhancers, but a critical issue is how well orthologous cne sequences retain the same activity in their respective species, a characteristic important for generalization of model organism studies.  since the discovery that many transcriptional enhancers are transcribed into long noncoding rnas termed ""enhancer rnas"" (ernas), their putative role in enhancer function has been debated.  recent studies have demonstrated that enhancers are often associated with non-coding rnas (ncrnas), yet the functional role of these enhancer:ncrna associations is unclear.  evolutionarily conserved non-coding genomic sequences represent a potentially rich source for the discovery of gene regulatory region such as transcriptional enhancers.  conserved noncoding elements (cnes) are elements exhibiting extreme noncoding conservation in metazoan genomes.  recent studies have revealed that active enhancers are transcribed, producing a class of noncoding rnas called enhancer rnas (ernas).  enhancer rnas (ernas) are a subset of long noncoding rna generated from genomic enhancers: they are thought to act as potent promoters of the expression of nearby genes through interaction with the transcriptional and epigenomic machineries.  enhancers have been conventionally perceived as cis-acting elements that provide binding sites for trans-acting factors.  long non-coding rnas (ncrna) have recently been demonstrated to be expressed from a subset of enhancers and to be required for the distant regulation of gene expression.  enhancer rnas (ernas) are a novel class of non-coding rna (ncrna) molecules transcribed from the dna sequences of enhancer regions.  in general, splicing regulatory elements are defined as enhancers or silencers depending on their positive or negative effect upon exon inclusion.  enhancers and antisense rnas play key roles in transcriptional regulation through differing mechanisms.  our findings present a new view of enhancer action wherein enhancers may direct isoform-specific expression of genes through ncrna intermediates.  distant-acting transcriptional enhancers are particularly challenging to uncover because they are scattered among the vast non-coding portion of the genome.  however, recent studies have shown that enhancers are transcribed and that these transcripts, called enhancer rnas (ernas), have a regulatory function.  evolutionary sequence constraint can facilitate the discovery of enhancers, but fails to predict when and where they are active in vivo.  emerging studies, showing that ernas function in controlling mrna transcription, challenge the idea that enhancers are merely sites of transcription factor assembly.  in this work, we explore the utility of adding the notion of conserved core regions into a comparative genomics approach for the search for putative functional elements in noncoding dna. ||| ",Yes
Is PLK2 involved in alpha-synuclein phosphorylation in the nervous system?,Yes,"The context suggests that PLK2 is a serine/threonine kinase that has been proposed to be the major factor responsible for phosphorylating alpha-synuclein at serine-129 in Parkinson's disease. The data reveal a functional interaction between alpha-synuclein and protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) that leads to PP2A activation and underscores a key role for alpha-synuclein in protein phosphorylation. The findings provide novel mechanistic insight into the role of phosphorylation at s87 and s129 in the pathogenesis of synucleinopathies and potential roles of phosphorylation in alpha-syn normal biology. The results indicate that phosphorylation of alpha-synuclein might be involved in one of the fyn-mediated signaling pathways in neuronal cells. The kinase responsible for alpha-synuclein s129 phosphorylation is constitutively active in SH-SY5Y cells and involves casein kinase 2 activity. In conclusion, the context suggests that PLK2 is involved in alpha-synuclein phosphorylation in the nervous system.","polo like kinase 2 (plk2), a serine/threonine serum inducible kinase, has been proposed to be the major factor responsible for phosphorylating alpha-synuclein (α-syn) at serine-129 (ser-129) in parkinson's disease (pd).  to gain insight into the functions of alpha-synuclein, we sought protein kinases that phosphorylate alpha-synuclein in the central nervous system.  alpha-synuclein (α-syn) is a neuronal protein that is highly implicated in parkinson's disease (pd), and protein phosphatase 2a (pp2a) is an important serine/threonine phosphatase that is associated with neurodegenerative diseases, such as pd.  together the data reveal a functional interaction between alpha-synuclein and pp2a that leads to pp2a activation and underscores a key role for alpha-synuclein in protein phosphorylation.  we further examined the relationship between mapk signaling and the effects of alpha-synuclein expression on ecdysone-inducible neuro2a cell lines and found that cells expressing alpha-synuclein had less phosphorylated mapks.  alpha-synuclein is a small protein implicated in the pathophysiology of parkinson's disease (pd).  alpha synuclein can be phosphorylated at serine129 (p-s129), and the presence of highly phosphorylated alpha-synuclein in lewy bodies suggests changes to its phosphorylation status has an important pathological role.  several lines of evidence suggest that phosphorylation of α-synuclein (α-syn) at s87 or s129 may play an important role in regulating its aggregation, fibrillogenesis, lewy body formation, and neurotoxicity in vivo.  in conclusion, prap functions as a downstream target for pyk2/raftk and plays a role in alpha-synuclein phosphorylation.  together, our findings provide novel mechanistic insight into the role of phosphorylation at s87 and s129 in the pathogenesis of synucleinopathies and potential roles of phosphorylation in alpha-syn normal biology.  since fyn regulates various signal transduction pathways in the central nervous system and plays an essential role in the neuronal cell differentiation, survival, and plasticity, results of this paper indicate that phosphorylation of alpha-synuclein might be involved in one of the fyn-mediated signaling pathways in neuronal cells.  we demonstrate that the kinase(s) responsible for alpha-synuclein s129 phosphorylation is constitutively active in sh-sy5y cells and involves casein kinase 2 activity.  inhibition of pp2a dramatically increased ser40 phosphorylation only in alpha-synuclein overexpressors in which alpha-synuclein was also found to co-immunoprecipitate with pp2a.  alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn) phosphorylation at serine 129 is characteristic of parkinson disease (pd) and related alpha-synulceinopathies.  alpha-synuclein (α-syn) is the principal protein component of lewy bodies, a pathological hallmark of parkinson's disease (pd).  increasing evidence suggests that phosphorylation may play an important role in the oligomerization, fibrillogenesis, lewy body (lb) formation, and neurotoxicity of alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn) in parkinson disease.  α-synuclein (α-syn) is a cytosolic protein known for its association with neurodegenerative diseases, including parkinson's disease and other synucleinopathies.  alpha-synuclein is a presynaptic protein involved in the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative diseases, such as parkinson's disease.  we observed that alpha-synuclein overexpression caused reduced ser40 phosphorylation in mn9d cells and inducible pc12 cells.  such phosphorylation was inhibited by prap expression, suggesting that prap negatively regulates alpha-synuclein phosphorylation following cell stress. ||| ",Yes
Is the gene CDKN2A nevogenic?,No,"The gene CDKN2A is not considered nevogenic, as it is primarily known for its role in tumor suppression and cell cycle regulation. The gene encodes proteins that are involved in preventing uncontrolled cell growth, and its inactivation has been observed in various human malignancies. While the gene has been implicated in melanoma susceptibility, there is no evidence to suggest that it directly contributes to the formation of nevi, which are benign skin lesions. The gene's involvement in tumorigenesis is primarily related to its role in regulating cell cycle progression and preventing abnormal cell growth.","the status of the cdkn2a gene family, including cdkn2a, cdkn2b, and cdkn2c, was investigated in 24 cases of neuroblastoma.  cdkn2a is an evolutionarily conserved gene encoding proteins implicated in tumor suppression, ocular development, aging, and metabolic diseases.  inactivation of the cdkn2a gene could lead to uncontrolled cell growth.  cdkn2a has been implicated as a melanoma susceptibility gene in some kindreds with a family history of this disease.  the genetic locus cdkn2a has been linked to familial melanoma, and mutations or deletions in its coding sequence are seen in some cases of sporadic and familial melanomas.  cdkn2a gene belongs to the genes involved in cell cycle regulation.  molecular genetic studies have revealed that deletions in cdkn2a occur frequently in cancer.  inactivation of cdkn2a gene is observed in many human malignancies, including larynx cancer.  cdkn2a is thought to be the main candidate gene for melanoma susceptibility.  homozygous deletions and mutations of the cdkn2a gene were not found.  absence of cdkn2a gene expression was shown in 27% (6/22) at mrna level and 21% (4/19) at protein level.  the cdkn2a/b locus contains crucial tumor suppressors and a lncrna gene anril.  these data suggest that the cdkn2a gene is involved in the tumorigenesis of ovarian cancer, but the mechanisms of cdkn2a gene inactivation in serous papillary ovarian cancer remains unclear.  this finding suggests the occurrence of a correlation between cdkn2b transcription and tumor phenotype.  in humans, the cdkn2a locus encodes two transcripts, ink4a and arf.  promoter hypermethylation of the cdkn2a gene has been suspected to be involved in the carcinogenesis of colorectal cancers.  deletion or mutations in the cdkn2a gene may produce an imbalance between functional p16 and cyclin d, causing abnormal cell growth.  finally, expression of the cdkn2b gene was demonstrated in all stage iv neuroblastomas, whereas none of stage i tumors expressed this gene.  novel rnas transcribed from the cdkn2a gene were screened by cdkn2a-specific rna capture deep-sequencing and confirmed by northern blotting and clone-sequencing.  the prevalence of cdkn2a mutation in our study was 4.5% (1/22) and there was a correlation between family history and probability of mutation detection. ||| ",Yes
Has small pox been eradicated from the world?,Yes,"Smallpox, caused by the variola virus, has been completely eradicated from the world, as declared by the World Health Organization in 1980. This was achieved through a concerted vaccination campaign led by the World Health Organization, following successful vaccination campaigns through the 19th and 20th centuries. The eradication of smallpox marked the first instance of a human disease being eradicated, and to date, it remains the only infectious disease to have been eradicated. The concept of disease eradication emerged in the mid-20th century, and the successful eradication of smallpox has led to the cessation of all control measures, including vaccination. However, despite the eradication of smallpox, the threat of pox virus infections remains due to the potential use of smallpox as a biological weapon and the susceptibility of the world population to diseases caused by orthopoxviruses.","despite the successful eradication of smallpox by the who-led vaccination programme, pox virus infections remain a considerable health threat.  currently, smallpox, caused by the variola virus belonging to the poxvirus family, has been completely eradicated according to the who.  following successful vaccination campaigns through the 19th and 20th centuries, smallpox was declared eradicated by the world health organization in 1980.  as yet, the only human infectious disease eradicated from our planet is smallpox, caused by variola virus a member of the poxvirus family.  although various attempts have been made to eradicate infectious diseases, only smallpox has been eradicated to date.  to date, the only infectious disease that has been eradicated is smallpox.  smallpox eradication was a rare event.  however, smallpox has not totally disappeared from people's minds because of its potential use as a biological weapon.  smallpox was the first human disease to be eradicated, through a concerted vaccination campaign led by the world health organization.  with more than 2 years having elapsed since the last case of paralytic poliomyelitis occurred in the western hemisphere, significant progress has been made towards the global eradication of wild polioviruses.  eradication is the permanent reduction to zero of the worldwide incidence of infection caused by a specific agent as a result of deliberate efforts; intervention measures are no longer needed.  the global poliomyelitis eradication initiative has been a tremendous success, with current evidence suggesting that wild poliovirus will cease to circulate anywhere in the world soon after the year 2000.  prior to the world health organization's announcement of total eradication in 1977  naturally occurring smallpox was eradicated as a result of successful vaccination campaigns during the 1960s and 1970s.  the concept of disease eradication emerged as recently as the mid-20th century.  the eradication of smallpox was announced by the who in 1980.  in 1980, the world health organization eradication program discontinued vaccination for smallpox and declared that the disease had been eliminated.  in the last century, smallpox was declared eradicated from the human community; however, the mechanisms responsible for the emergence of new dangerous pathogens have yet to be unraveled.  the successful eradication of smallpox resulted in the concept of the extinction of the causative agent in man as well as in the environment, leading to the cessation of all control measures including vaccination.  since its eradication, routine vaccination against smallpox has ceased, leaving the world population susceptible to disease caused by orthopoxviruses. ||| ",Yes
Is JTV519 (K201) a potential drug for the prevention of arrhythmias?,Yes,"JTV519 (K201) has been demonstrated to have significant protective effects on atrial fibrillation in the canine sterile pericarditis model, primarily by increasing the effective refractory period. This suggests its potential as a novel antiarrhythmic agent for atrial fibrillation. The drug exhibits a strong cardioprotective action and acts as a multiple-channel blocker, including as a k+ channel blocker. It has been shown to inhibit ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum and stabilize the closed state of the ryanodine receptor, thereby preventing myocardial damage and the induction of arrhythmias during ca2+ overload.

Does verubecestat activate BACE?,No,"The context does not provide information on the relationship between verubecestat and BACE (Beta-secretase 1). Verubecestat is a BACE1 inhibitor, and its primary function is to reduce the production of beta-amyloid peptides by inhibiting the BACE1 enzyme. The context focuses on the clinical implications of vertebrobasilar ectasia (VBE) in patients with cerebral small-artery disease and the role of virginiae butanolides (VBs) in triggering virginiamycin production in Streptomyces virginiae. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether verubecestat activates BACE based on the provided context.","after adjustment for other risk factors, vbe was not predictive of recurrent stroke (hazard ratio , 1.3; 95% confidence interval , .85-1.9) or major hemorrhage (hr, 1.5; ci, .94-2.6), but was of death (hr, 1.7; ci, 1.1-2.7).  the clinical implications of vertebrobasilar ectasia (vbe) in patients with cerebral small-artery disease are not well defined.  vbe was defined a priori as basilar artery greater than 4.5 mm and/or vertebral artery greater than 4.0 mm.  subjects were classified as vbe-negative or vbe-positive, who were further classified based on the presence of vad with magnetic resonance angiography.  we investigated whether vbe is associated with recurrent stroke, major hemorrhage, and death in a large cohort of patients with recent lacunar stroke.  there was a significant difference in the risk of posterior circulation ischemic stroke between the vbe-positive group and the vbe-negative group (p = 0.002).  virginiae butanolides (vbs) a-e are butyrolactone autoregulators that control virginiamycin production in streptomyces virginiae.  virginiae butanolides (vbs), which are among the butyrolactone autoregulators of streptomyces species, act as a primary signal in streptomyces virginiae to trigger virginiamycin biosynthesis and possess a specific binding protein, bara.  virginiae butanolide (vb) is a gamma-butyrolactone autoregulator that triggers production of the streptogramin antibiotic virginiamycin in streptomyces virginiae.  patient characteristics and risks of stroke recurrence and mortality during follow-up (median, 3.5 years) were compared between patients with and without vbe.  virginiae butanolide (vb) is a member of the gamma-butyrolactone autoregulators and triggers the production of streptogramin antibiotics virginiamycin m1 and s in streptomyces virginiae.  background and purpose: although vertebrobasilar ectasia (vbe) is diagnosed with increasing frequency, it is not clear whether this is because of altered hemodynamics caused by the effects of matrix metalloproteinases (mmps) and/or vertebral artery dominance (vad).  virginiae butanolides (vbs) are autoregulators of streptomyces virginiae, which induce virginiamycin biosynthesis.  virginiae butanolide c (vb-c) is an autoregulator which triggers virginiamycin production in streptomyces virginiae.  baseline systolic blood pressure was inversely associated with vbe.  bara of streptomyces virginiae is a specific receptor protein for virginiae butanolide (vb), one of the gamma-butyrolactone autoregulators of the streptomyces species, and acts as a transcriptional regulator controlling both virginiamycin production and vb biosynthesis.  that is, although vbs are needed to induce virginiamycin m and s synthesis, the amount of vb-c added should be such that as small an amount as possible of vbs is synthesized to achieve the maximum production of virginiamycins m and s. however, the vb-c addition earlier than 8 h from the start of culture showed no clear relationship between the amounts of vbs and virginiamycins m and s produced.  a bars2-disruptant (strain ic152), created by means of homologous recombination, showed no differences in growth in liquid medium or morphology on solid medium compared to a wild-type strain, suggesting that bars2 does not play any role in primary metabolism or morphological differentiation of s. virginiae.  northern blot analysis indicated that the bicistronic transcript of barb-vars appeared 1 to 2 h before the onset of virginiamycin m1 and s production, at which time vb was produced, while exogenously added virginiamycin s apparently induced the monocistronic vars transcript.  addition of chemically synthesized virginiae butanolide-c (vb-c), which is one of the vbs, can also control the induction time and the amount of virginiamycin production. ||| ",No

Therefore, based on the provided context, it can be concluded that human lysyl oxidase-like 2 is a glycoprotein.","the lysyl oxidase-like 2 (loxl2) protein is a human paralogue of lysyl oxidase (lox) that functions as an amine oxidase for formation of lysine-derived cross-links found in collagen and elastin.  lysyl oxidase-like 2 (loxl2) is a member of the lysyl oxidase family, which plays an important role in extracellular matrix protein biosynthesis and tumor progression.  lysyl oxidase-like 2 (loxl2) is a copper and lysine tyrosyl-quinone (ltq)-dependent amine oxidase belonging to the lysyl oxidase (lox) family, the canonical function of which is to catalyze the crosslinking of elastin and collagen in the extracellular matrix (ecm).  human lysyl oxidase-like 2 (hloxl2), a glycoprotein implicated in tumor progression and organ fibrosis, is a molecular target for anticancer and antifibrosis treatment.  lysyl oxidase homolog 2 (loxl2), also known as lysyl oxidase-like protein 2 is recently been explored as regulator of carcinogenesis and has been shown to be involved in tumor progression and metastasis of several carcinomas.  lysyl oxidase-like 2 (loxl2), a member of the lysyl oxidase (lox) family, is a copper-dependent enzyme that catalyzes oxidative deamination of lysine residues on protein substrates.  glyoxalase 2 is a beta-lactamase fold-containing enzyme that appears to be involved with cellular chemical detoxification.  lysyl oxidase-like 2 (loxl2) belongs to the family of lysyl oxidases, and as such promotes crosslinking of collagens and elastin by oxidative deamination of lysine residues.  lysyl oxidase like-2 (loxl2) belongs to the lysyl oxidase (lox) family, which comprises cu(2+)- and lysine tyrosylquinone (ltq)-dependent amine oxidases.  lysyl oxidase-like 2 (loxl2) is a member of the lysyl oxidase (lox) family that contributes to tumor cell metastasis.  lysyl oxidase-like 2 (loxl2) is a member of the lysyl oxidase gene family that contributes to the invasiveness and metastasis in tumor progression.  lysyl oxidase like 2, loxl2, as a member of the lysyl oxidase (lox) family, has been shown to function similarly to lox in the extracellular matrix (ecm) by promoting crosslinking of collagen and elastin.  lysyl oxidase-like 2 (loxl2), a copper-dependent enzyme of the lysyl oxidase family and its nonsecreted, catalytically dead spliced isoform l2δ13, enhance cell migration and invasion, stimulate filopodia formation, modulate the expression of cytoskeletal genes, and promote tumor development and metastasis in vivo.  the aim of this study was to elucidate the role of lysyl oxidase (lox) and lysyl oxidase like (loxl) 2 in pathologic wound healing after glaucoma surgery.  unlike cytosolic glyoxalase 2 from a. thaliana, glx2-5 does not appear to specifically bind manganese.  as a first step in understanding the structure and function of mitochondrial glyoxalase 2 enzymes, a mitochondrial isozyme (glx2-5) from arabidopsis thaliana was cloned, overexpressed, purified, and characterized using metal analyses, epr and (1)h nmr spectroscopies, and x-ray crystallography.  lectin-like oxidized ldl receptor-1 (lox-1) is a type ii membrane protein belonging to the c-type lectin family molecules, which can act as a cell-surface endocytosis receptor for atherogenic oxidized ldl.  all of the purified recombinant loxl2 proteins, with or without the srcr domains in the n-terminus, showed significant amine oxidase activity toward several different types of collagen and elastin in in vitro amine oxidase assays, indicating deletion of the srcr domains does not interfere with amine oxidase activity of loxl2.  this glycoprotein contains three predicted n-linked glycosylation sites; one is near the protein's active site, and at least one more is known to facilitate the protein's secretion.  while the observed oxidation-reduction with dioxygen is only a side reaction of the predominant physiological product glutaryl-coa, the efficiency of superoxide/ h2o2 production was 7-times larger from oa than from og, making the reaction of ogdhc with oa one of the important superoxide/ h2o2 producers among 2-oxo acid dehydrogenase complexes in mitochondria. ||| ",Yes
Can exosomes be detected in urine?,Yes,"Exosomes, a type of extracellular vesicle, have been reported to be present in urine. These vesicles, which are released by various cells, contain molecular constituents such as proteins and genetic materials. They have been isolated from urine using methods such as ultracentrifugation. The presence of exosomes in urine has been linked to intercellular signaling and diagnostic utility. Furthermore, exosomal proteins in urine have been suggested as potential biomarkers for various diseases, including urological cancers and nonurological cancers. The detection of exosomes in urine has been demonstrated in as little as 0.5 ml of urine, and their isolation is considered a non-invasive method for biomarker discovery.","extracellular vesicles, such as exosomes, are present in urine with reports of roles in intercellular signalling and diagnostic utility.  urinary exosomes were isolated via ultracentrifugation.  exosomes present in urine were quantified, and expression of prostate markers (psa and psma) and tumour-associated marker 5t4 was examined.  exosomes are potentially a more targeted source of material for biomarker discovery than unfractionated urine, and provide diagnostic and pathophysiological information without an invasive tissue biopsy.  exosomes are cytoplasm containing vesicles released by many cells that can be found in several biological fluids including urine.  here, we describe the discovery of urinary exosomes and address the issues on the collection, isolation, and normalization of urinary exosomes as well as delineate the systems biology approach to biomarker discovery using urinary exosomes.  urinary exosomes are an appealing source for biomarker discovery as they contain molecular constituents of their cell of origin, including proteins and genetic materials, and they can be isolated in a non-invasive manner.  recently, nanometer sized vesicles (termed exosomes) have been described as a component of urine.  urine exosomes are small vesicles exocytosed into the urine by all renal epithelial cell types under normal physiologic and disease states.  exosomes are vesicles that are released from the kidney into urine.  following the discovery of urinary exosomes in 2004, many studies have been performed using urinary exosomes as a starting material to identify biomarkers in various renal, urogenital, and systemic diseases.  increasing evidence shows that exosomal proteins in urine may be used as novel biomarkers for certain diseases.  exosomes represent an important and readily isolated subset of the urinary proteome that has the potential to shed much insight on the health status of the kidney.  the protein cargo of urine exosomes is emerging as an attractive source for biomarkers, not only for urological cancers, such as prostate, bladder and kidney cancer, but potentially also for nonurological cancers, including gastric, lung, oesophageal and colorectal cancer.  nanovesicles present in urine the so-called urinary exosomes have been found to be secreted by every epithelial cell type lining the urinary tract system in human.  exosomes are released by most cells and can be isolated from all biofluids including urine.  there are accumulating evidence that proteins carried by exosomes in urine are most possibly used as biomarkers or therapeutic carriers for certain diseases.  exosomal markers were detected in as little as 0.5 ml of urine.  our aim in this study was to investigate the feasibility and value of analysing urinary exosomes in prostate cancer patients undergoing standard therapy.  urinary nano-extracellular vesicles (nvs), including exosomes and microvesicles, are considered potential biomarkers for kidney diseases using liquid biopsies. ||| ",Yes
Are selenium supplements recommended for prostate cancer prevention?,No,"The evidence regarding the efficacy of selenium supplements for prostate cancer prevention is conflicting. While some preclinical, epidemiological, and phase III data suggest that selenium, in combination with vitamin E, may have potential efficacy in prostate cancer prevention, other clinical trials have not demonstrated clear benefits in patients. The biological effects of selenium on normal or malignant prostate cells are not well known, and the form of selenium and mechanisms underlying protection remain largely unknown. Therefore, it is currently inconclusive whether selenium supplements are recommended for prostate cancer prevention.","increased dietary intake of selenium (se) has been suggested to lower prostate cancer mortality, but supplementation trials have produced conflicting results.  daily supplementation with the essential trace mineral selenium significantly reduced prostate cancer risk in men in the nutritional prevention of cancer trial.  growing evidence implies that selenium and vitamin e may decrease the risk of prostate cancer.  evidence suggests that both selenium and vitamin e reduce the risk of prostate cancer.  growing evidence suggests that both selenium and vitamin e may reduce the risk of prostate cancer.  preclinical, epidemiological and phase iii data imply that selenium and vitamin e have potential efficacy for prostate cancer prevention.  preclinical, epidemiologic, and phase iii data suggest that both selenium and vitamin e have potential efficacy in prostate cancer prevention.  preclinical, epidemiological, and phase iii data from randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials suggest that both selenium and vitamin e have potential efficacy in prostate cancer prevention.  selenium and vitamin e are probably 2 of the most popular dietary supplements considered for use in the reduction of prostate cancer risk.  preclinical and epidemiological studies have suggested the use of supplements such as selenium and vitamin e for prostate cancer (pca) prevention; however, clinical trials have not demonstrated clear benefit in patients.  vitamin e and selenium are the two most popular dietary supplements used to prevent prostate cancer.  various formulations of selenium and vitamin e, both essential human dietary components, have been shown to possess a therapeutic and preventive effect against prostate cancer.  epidemiological and clinical data suggest that selenium may prevent prostate cancer, but the biological effects of selenium on normal or malignant prostate cells are not well known.  epidemiologic and clinical data suggest that selenium could prevent prostate cancer, but it has not been shown that supplemental selenium leads to an increased concentration of selenium in prostate tissue compared with adjacent tissue.  the dietary trace element selenium has been proposed to be a potential chemopreventive agent for prostate cancer.  the dietary microelement selenium (se) has been proposed as a potential chemopreventive agent for prostate cancer.  epidemiologic studies and secondary analyses of randomized trials supported the hypothesis that selenium and vitamin e lower prostate cancer risk.  the preclinical and epidemiological evidence supporting a role for selenium and vitamin e as chemopreventive agents in prostate cancer are reviewed, and details of the trial design are presented.  we hypothesize that selenium potentiates vitamin e-induced inhibition of prostate cancer cell growth in vitro.  epidemiological studies and clinical trials show that selenium supplementation results in reduction of prostate cancer incidence; however, the form of selenium and mechanisms underlying protection remain largely unknown. ||| ",No
Is autophagy the process where bacteria ingest viral particles?,No,"Justification: Autophagy is a process by which cells, including bacterial cells, degrade and recycle their own components or foreign components such as viral particles. However, it is not a process where bacteria actively ingest viral particles. Instead, viral particles are engulfed into double-membrane vesicles called autophagosomes, which then fuse with lysosomes for degradation. This process can be used by the cell as a defense mechanism against viral infections, but it can also be exploited by some viruses for their own replication.","autophagy is an intracellular degradation and recycling process that can also remove pathogenic intracellular bacteria and viruses from within cells (referred to as xenophagy) and activate the adaptive immune responses.  autophagy is a protective process against some intracellular bacteria and viruses; however, it is also used for replication by some viruses, such as poliovirus.  previous study showed that avibirnavirus particles could be engulfed into the autophagosome and degradation of virus particles took apart.  autophagy is a process to engulf aberrant organelles or protein aggregates into double-membrane vesicles for lysosomal breakdown.  autophagy, an ancient and highly conserved intracellular degradation process, is viewed as a critical component of innate immunity because of its ability to deliver cytosolic bacteria to the lysosome.  rationale: autophagy is an essential, homeostatic process by which cells break down their own components, it also contributes to restricting bacterial infection in host defense systems; yet, how autophagy regulates viral infection remains inconclusive.  autophagy involves the sequestration of endogenous or foreign components from the cytosol within double-membraned vesicles and the delivery of their content to the lysosomes for degradation.  (1,2) bacteria and viruses targeted for destruction are sequestered into large double-membrane vesicles called autophagosomes and subsequently delivered to the lysosomes where they are consumed by resident hydrolases.  bacteria that escape from membrane-enclosed vacuoles to the cytosol of cells are targeted by autophagy, which recognizes and captures bacteria into autophagosomes wherein their proliferation is restricted.  bacterial autophagy-a type of macroautophagy that is also termed xenophagy-selectively targets intracellular bacteria such as group a streptococcus (gas), a ubiquitous pathogen that causes numerous serious diseases, including pharyngitis, skin infections, and invasive life-threatening infections.  activation of autophagy is part of the innate immune response during viral infections.  in recent years, the process of selective autophagy has received much attention with respect to the clearance of protein aggregates, damaged mitochondria and bacteria.  conversely, pathogens can evolve proteins which modulate the autophagy pathway to subvert degradation and establish an infection.  cellular autophagy, a process that directs cytosolic contents to the endosomal and lysosomal pathways via the formation of double-membraned vesicles, is a crucial aspect of innate immunity to many intracellular pathogens.  unfortunately, conserved cellular pathways are often exploited by pathogens to facilitate their entry or replication, and autophagy is no exception.  during infection, cvb co-opts a cellular pathway, termed autophagy, to provide the membranes necessary for its replication.  autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved process by which cells ingest damaged organelles as a means of maintaining cell homeostasis.  selective autophagy is a highly specific and regulated degradation pathway for the clearance of damaged or unwanted cytosolic components and superfluous organelles as well as invading microbes.  pathogenic bacteria have evolved several mechanisms to escape degradation or exploit autophagy to acquire host nutrients.  many picornaviruses induce autophagy to benefit viral replication, but an understanding of how autophagy occurs remains incomplete. ||| ",Yes
Have gnotobiotic animal models been used for the study of bowel disease?,Yes,"Gnotobiotic animal models, including the gnotobiotic pig, have been utilized in the study of bowel disease, specifically in pathogenesis and vaccine studies for H. pylori. These models have been used alongside other species such as non-human primates, cats, dogs, and various rodents including mice, rats, gerbils, and guinea pigs. The use of these models is critical for understanding disease pathogenesis and testing novel therapeutics.","animal models of colitis are widely used to study the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel diseases (ibd) and irritable bowel syndrome (ibs).  the purpose of this review is to summarize the various types of animal models available for use in inflammatory bowel disease research and to illustrate how these models have contributed to a better understanding of the etiopathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease, particularly focusing on papers published during calendar year 1999.  recently, a number of animal models for different aspects of inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) have been developed.  animal models recapitulating features of chronic colitis, such as ulcerative colitis, crohn's disease, or hiv infection, are critical to study disease pathogenesis and test novel therapeutics.  animal model systems have been used extensively to study both experimental and naturally occurring ulcerative colitis syndromes.  animal models are useful for studying disease, but there is a shortage of suitable models of ulcerative colitis.  until recently there existed no appropriate immunological animal models for human inflammatory bowel diseases (ibd).  the availability of new animal models that closely resemble the human disease is expected to allow further characterization of the initiating event(s) in inflammatory bowel disease and lead to a possible cure for this devastating disease.  although there have been numerous attempts to produce inflammatory ulcerative colonic disease in laboratory animals resembling those human disease forms, none has been entirely successful.  animal models are required for research regarding the pathogenesis and efficacy of anti-inflammatory agents in inflammatory bowel disease (ibd).  animal models of experimentally induced inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) are useful for understanding more about the mechanistic basis of disease, identifying new targets for therapeutic intervention, and testing novel therapeutic agents.  using an optimized protocol, dss treatment induces reproducibly typhlocolitis in mongolian gerbils, rendering them as a useful model for ibd.  the h. pylori animal models which have been used in pathogenesis and vaccine studies include the gnotobiotic pig, non-human primates, cats, dogs, and several species of rodents including mice, rats, gerbils and guinea pigs.  the spontaneous colitis models developed in the cotton-top tamarin monkey and the c3h/hejbir mouse mimic more features of human ibd.  murine models of intestinal inflammation have been widely used in biomedical research.  many animal models of ibd can be used to evaluate new anti-inflammatory drugs.  there are many types of colitis models in animals that researchers use to elucidate the mechanism of action of human inflammatory bowel disease (ibd).  rodent models have been developed to study the pathogenesis of diseases caused by helicobacter pylori, as well as by other gastric and intestinal helicobacter spp., but some murine enteric helicobacter spp.  ulcerative colitis and crohn's disease are complex, problematic diseases of unknown etiology in man, and appropriate experimental models would be useful in elucidating their pathogenesis and treatment.  today a number of models, mostly in the mouse and rat, have proved useful in the study of several aspects of ibd, including the histopathology and the disease-inductive and -protective cell types, subsets and cytokines, for example cd4+ t cells, ifn gamma, il-12, il-2, il-10 and tgf beta. ||| ",Yes
Are psammoma bodies characteristic to meningiomas?,Yes,"Psammoma bodies are laminated, calcified spherites that are commonly associated with meningiomas. They are often found in meningiomas, along with meningothelial cells, and their presence can aid in the diagnosis of a meningioma. The fine structure of psammoma bodies has been examined in several cases of meningioma, and it has been demonstrated that they contain type VI collagen and laminin. The presence of meningothelial elements along with abundant psammoma bodies is indicative of a benign meningioma. Additionally, recent studies have proposed histogenetic and phenotypic similarities between meningiomas and mesotheliomas, further supporting the association of psammoma bodies with meningiomas.","the fine structure of psammoma bodies was examined in four cases of fibroblastic meningioma.  we report a case of psammomatous meningioma in which meningothelial cells and psammoma bodies were both abundant and diffuse, allowing for the diagnosis of a meningioma.  to demonstrate that psammoma bodies in human meningiomas contain type vi collagen and laminin.  meningiomas often contain concentric calcified foci, referred to as psammoma bodies.  we examined psammoma bodies at the ultrastructural level within meningocytic whorls in nine cases of meningioma.  seven cases of meningiomas with ""pseudopsammoma bodies"" have previously been described in the literature.  this is the first report to describe the involvement of type vi collagen in psammoma bodies and whorl formations in meningiomas.  psammoma bodies are laminated, calcified spherites, commonly associated with meningiomas, ovarian serous cystadenocarcinomas, and papillary carcinoma of the thyroid.  it is concluded that meningotheliomatous meningiomas with ""pseudopsammoma bodies"" are mixed tumours, including a non-meningotheliomatous component, the origin and significance of which is uncertain.  the fna smear showed the spindle-shaped cells in concentric whorls and scattered psammoma bodies that are characteristic of meningioma.  two cases of primary extracranial meningioma of the psammomatous variant are reported here.  a case of right frontal sinus tumor which at histology turned out to be a psammomatous meningioma is reported.  the presence of meningothelial elements along with abundant psammoma bodies indicates the presence of a benign meningioma within a teratoma.  because the morphology and components of psammoma bodies in papillary carcinoma of the thyroid are similar to those of psammoma bodies in meningioma, we examined whether opn was related to the psammoma bodies in papillary carcinoma of the thyroid.  electron microscopy of the cells surrounding the ""pseudopsammoma bodies"" reveals an ultrastructure different from that of the meningotheliomatous cells.  we report a case of a psammomatous variant of meningioma arising in a pure and mature testicular teratoma.  these findings suggest that both matrix giant bodies and matrix vesicles may serve as initial nidus of calcification of psammoma bodies in fibroblastic meningioma.  recently, histogenetic and phenotypic similarities between meningiomas and mesotheliomas have been proposed.  in meningioma with pseudopsammoma bodies, igg was secreted from tumour cells which differentiated to secretory epithelial cells, and was found to deposit in the pseudopsammoma bodies.  the present result suggests that opn produced by cd68-positive macrophages may play a significant role for development of psammoma bodies in meningiomas. ||| ",Yes
Is Solanezumab effective for Alzheimer's Disease?,No,"Solanezumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds soluble amyloid beta peptide, has been tested in clinical trials for the treatment of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). However, in the Expedition 1 and 2 phase 3 clinical trials, solanezumab was shown to be ineffective in subjects with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease and had no effect on brain amyloid beta burden. Furthermore, solanezumab failed to improve cognition or functional ability in patients with AD. Despite its ability to increase total cerebrospinal fluid levels of amyloid beta and promote its clearance from the brain, solanezumab did not produce meaningful cognitive effects. Therefore, based on the available evidence, solanezumab is not considered an effective treatment for Alzheimer's Disease.","solanezumab at a dose of 400 mg administered every 4 weeks in patients with mild alzheimer's disease did not significantly affect cognitive decline.  solanezumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds soluble amyloid beta peptide, is being developed for treatment of alzheimer's disease (ad).  solanezumab treatment was previously shown to significantly increase total (bound + unbound) cerebrospinal fluid (csf) levels of amyloid β (aβ)1-40 and aβ1-42 in patients with mild to moderate alzheimer's disease dementia yet did not produce meaningful cognitive effects.  in the expedition 1 and 2 phase 3 clinical trials, solanezumab was shown to be ineffective in subjects with mild-to-moderate alzheimer's disease, and to have no effect on brain aβ burden.  solanezumab is an anti-amyloid monoclonal antibody in clinical testing for treatment of alzheimer's disease (ad).  solanezumab is a humanized anti-amyloid β monoclonal antibody being developed as a passive immunization treatment to slow the progression of alzheimer disease (ad).  solanezumab (ly2062430) is a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds to the central region of β-amyloid, a peptide believed to play a key role in the pathogenesis of alzheimer's disease (ad).  solanezumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody, preferentially binds soluble forms of amyloid and in preclinical studies promoted its clearance from the brain.  solanezumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds amyloid, failed to improve cognition or functional ability.  solanezumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that preferentially binds to soluble amyloid β and promotes its clearance from the brain in preclinical studies.  solanezumab is a monoclonal antibody that binds to β-amyloid (aβ), a protein that plays a key role in the pathogenesis of ad.  ly2062430 (solanezumab) is a humanized monoclonal antibody being studied as a putative disease-modifying treatment of ad.  in two phase 3, double-blind trials (expedition 1 and expedition 2), we randomly assigned 1012 and 1040 patients, respectively, with mild-to-moderate alzheimer's disease to receive placebo or solanezumab (administered intravenously at a dose of 400 mg) every 4 weeks for 18 months.  acute and subchronic treatment with solanezumab of transgenic mice attenuated or reversed memory deficits with no effects on incidence or severity of cerebral amyloid angiopathy-associated microhemorrhages, a severe side effect associated with bapineuzumab, another monoclonal antibody.  further studies of solanezumab for the treatment of ad are warranted.  in the expedition3 phase 3 trial, participants with mild alzheimer's disease were randomized to receive intravenous infusions of either 400 mg of solanezumab or placebo every 4 weeks for 76 weeks.  solanezumab can neutralize soluble aβ peptides, which may represent the more neurotoxic of the aβ species.  plasma and csf concentrations of solanezumab and amyloid beta (abeta) and cognitive evaluations were obtained.  the humanized monoclonal antibody solanezumab was designed to increase the clearance from the brain of soluble aβ, peptides that may lead to toxic effects in the synapses and precede the deposition of fibrillary amyloid.  selegiline, an irreversible inhibitor of monoamine oxidase b used in the treatment of parkinson's disease, has been demonstrated to have a potential cognition-improving effect in patients with alzheimer's disease (ad) undergoing treatment with an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor donepezil. ||| ",No

Can the Micro-C XL method achieve mononucleosome resolution?,Yes,"The Micro-C XL method is an improved technique for the analysis of chromosome folding at mononucleosome resolution. This method provides a single assay to interrogate chromosome folding at length scales from the nucleosome to the full genome. The use of micrococcal nuclease (MNase) digestion of chromatin is a widely used approach to probe nucleosome organization and generate mononucleosomes. The Micro-C XL method extends a recently developed Hi-C variant, Micro-C, to map chromosome architecture at nucleosome resolution in human cells. The method is capable of capturing known features of chromosome folding, including compartment organization, topologically associating domains, and interactions between CTCF binding sites.

Is TREM2 associated with Alzheimer's disease in humans?,Yes,"Justification: The context indicates that heterozygous genetic variants within the TREM2 gene are strongly associated with an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recent genome-wide association studies have identified the TREM2 rs75932628-T variant as a risk factor for AD and other neurodegenerative diseases. TREM2 is specifically expressed in brain microglia and modulates microglial functions in response to key AD pathologies such as amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and tau tangles. Loss-of-function TREM2 mutations have been linked to increased AD risk, and TREM2 deletion has been shown to exacerbate tau accumulation and spreading in the presence of β-amyloid pathology. While the mechanism by which TREM2 influences AD susceptibility is currently unknown, the evidence suggests a strong association between TREM2 and AD in humans.","heterozygous genetic variants within the trem2 gene show a strong association with increased alzheimer's disease (ad) risk.  recent genome-wide association studies revealed trem2 rs75932628-t variant to be associated with alzheimer's disease (ad) and other neurodegenerative diseases.  a rare variant in trem2 (p.r47h, rs75932628) was recently reported to increase the risk of alzheimer's disease (ad) and, subsequently, other neurodegenerative diseases, i.e.  loss-of-function trem2 mutations strongly increase alzheimer's disease (ad) risk.  recent genome-wide association studies linked variants in trem2 to a strong increase in the odds of developing alzheimer's disease.  trem2 is thought to trigger the microglial response to amyloid plaques.  triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 trem2 was identified as a risk factor for late onset alzheimer's disease (ad).  trem2 is specifically expressed in brain microglia and modulates microglial functions in response to key ad pathologies such as amyloid-β (aβ) plaques and tau tangles.  mutations in triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (trem2) have been linked to increased alzheimer's disease (ad) risk.  given that a single allele of variant trem2, likely resulting in a loss of function, conferred an increased risk of developing alzheimer's disease, we tested whether loss of one functional trem2 allele would affect aβ plaque deposition or the microglial response to aβ pathology in appps1-21 mice.  recent studies have found an association between a variant in triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (trem2) (rs75932628-t) and both alzheimer's disease (ad) and cognitive function in individuals aged 80-100 years.  heterozygous triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells (trem2) mutations are an alzheimer's disease (ad) risk factor.  in the presence of β-amyloid pathology, trem2 deletion further exacerbated tau accumulation and spreading and promoted brain atrophy.  here, we report that trem2 is up-regulated on myeloid cells surrounding amyloid deposits in ad mouse models and human ad tissue.  loss of function of triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cell 2 (trem2), a key receptor selectively expressed by microglia in the brain, contributes to the development of alzheimer's disease (ad).  our data demonstrate trem2 as a microglial aβ receptor transducing physiological and ad-related pathological effects associated with aβ.  to understand trem2 function in the context of both β-amyloid and tau pathologies, we examined trem2 deficiency in the pr5-183 mouse model expressing mutant tau alone or in taups2app mice, in which β-amyloid pathology exacerbates tau pathology and neurodegeneration.  rare coding variants in the triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (trem2) are associated with increased risk for alzheimer's disease (ad), but how they confer this risk remains uncertain.  a synthesis of the 35 mouse-model studies included in this review indicates that trem2 modulates amyloid plaque composition and deposition, microglial morphology and proliferation, neuroinflammation, and tau phosphorylation.  the mechanism by which trem2 influences the susceptibility to alzheimer's disease is currently unknown. ||| ",Yes
Is calcium overload involved in the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy?,Yes,"The evidence suggests that intracellular calcium overload in cardiac myocytes is involved in the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy. This is supported by findings of decreased contractility of diabetic myocardium associated with intracellular calcium overload, abnormal intracellular calcium metabolism in the diabetic heart, and cardiac dysfunction in diabetic cardiomyopathy associated with abnormal calcium homeostasis. Furthermore, studies have shown that diabetes results in impaired calcium homeostasis due to altered sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase and sodium-calcium exchanger activity. Type 2 diabetic cardiomyopathy features calcium signaling abnormalities, notably an altered mitochondrial calcium handling. Changes in calcium handling, disruption of the extracellular matrix regulation, and cardiac inflammation may be important mediators of this disease.","it has been suggested that intracellular ca2+ overload in cardiac myocytes leads to the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy.  it has been suggested that the occurrence of an intracellular ca2+ overload may result in the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy, which is associated with depletion of high-energy phosphate stores and a derangement of ultrastructure and cardiac dysfunction.  decreased contractility of diabetic myocardium is associated with intracellular calcium overload.  the diabetic heart has an abnormal intracellular calcium (i) metabolism.  cardiac dysfunction in diabetic cardiomyopathy may be associated with abnormal ca2+ homeostasis.  this study investigated the effects of alterations in ca2+ homeostasis and sarcoplasmic reticulum ca2+-associated proteins on cardiac function in the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy.  it is now becoming clear that cardiac dysfunction in chronic diabetes is intimately involved with ca(2+)-handling abnormalities, metabolic defects and impaired sensitivity of myofibrils to ca(2+) in cardiomyocytes.  these results suggest that casr activation could lead to the apoptosis of cardiomyocytes in diabetic cardiac injury through the induction of calcium overload, the activation of the mitochondrial, and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway.  hyperglycaemia is a major aetiological factor in the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy.  ca(2+)-handling abnormalities in the diabetic heart occur mainly due to defects in sarcolemmal na(+)-k(+) atpase, na(+)-ca(2+) exchange, na(+)-h(+) exchange, ca(2+)-channels and ca(2+)-pump activities as well as changes in sarcoplasmic reticular ca(2+)-uptake and ca(2+)-release processes; these alterations may lead to the occurrence of intracellular ca(2+) overload.  we have found aberrant diastolic ca2+ concentrations (d), decreased glucose transport, elevated production of reactive oxygen species (ros), and increased calpain activity in cardiomyocytes from a murine model (db/db) of type 2 diabetes (t2d).  studies in cardiomyocytes have shown that diabetes results in impaired (i) homeostasis due to altered sarcoplasmic reticulum ca(2+) atpase (serca) and sodium-calcium exchanger (ncx) activity.  type 2 diabetic cardiomyopathy features ca2+ signaling abnormalities, notably an altered mitochondrial ca2+ handling.  echocardiography and hemodynamic measurements revealed that cardiac dysfunction is associated with the progression of diabetes, which also correlated with a gradual but significant decline in ca2+ spark frequency (in the 4-, 8- and 12-week diabetic groups).  changes in calcium handling, disruption of the extracellular matrix regulation with accumulation of cardiac collagen, and furthermore cardiac inflammation may be an important mediator of this disease.  these results improve our understanding of how diabetes affects calcium regulation in cecs, and may contribute to the development of new therapies for dcm treatment.  therefore, our study demonstrates that the reticulum-mitochondria ca2+ miscoupling may play an early and reversible role in the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy by disrupting primarily the mitochondrial bioenergetics.  ca2+ sparks exhibited a time-dependent decay with progression of diabetic cardiomyopathy, which may partly contribute to cardiac dysfunction.  importantly, altered calcium homeostasis may also be involved in diabetes-associated endothelial dysfunction, including impaired endothelium-dependent relaxation and a diminished capacity to generate nitric oxide (no), elevated cell adhesion molecules, and decreased angiogenic growth factors.  clinical and experimental observation has showed the development of dysfunctional cardiomyopathy as one of the main complications of diabetes. ||| ",Yes
Does HuR protein regulate the splicing process?,Yes,"The Hur protein, a ubiquitously expressed RNA-binding protein, has been shown to regulate the expression of thousands of cellular transcripts by modulating mRNA splicing, trafficking, translation, and stability. Hur associates with numerous transcripts, both coding and noncoding, and controls their splicing, localization, stability, and translation. It has been well characterized as a mediator of mRNA stability and translation, and more recently, as a factor in nuclear functions such as pre-mRNA splicing.

Is NSD-1015 an inhibitor of Aromatic L-Amino Acid Decarboxylase?,Yes,"NSD-1015, also known as 3-hydroxybenzyl hydrazine, is a centrally acting aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) inhibitor. The context provided indicates that NSD-1015 inhibits AADC activity, as evidenced by the inhibition of dopamine formation and the elevation of L-dopa levels in plasma following its administration. The results suggest that NSD-1015 blocks central AADC activity, while also acting as a monoamine oxidase inhibitor, thus maintaining striatal dopamine concentration by reducing dopamine metabolism. Therefore, it can be concluded that NSD-1015 is an inhibitor of AADC.","the centrally acting aromatic amino acid dopa decarboxylase (aadc) inhibitor, 3-hydroxybenzyl hydrazine (nsd-1015), is widely used to study the neurotransmitter-like actions of l-dopa.  were inhibited by nsd-1015 (25 mg kg(-1) i.p.  these results suggest that, while nsd-1015 blocks central aadc activity, it also acts as a monoamine oxidase inhibitor so maintaining striatal dopamine concentration by reducing dopamine metabolism.  following central aadc inhibition with nsd-1015 (25 mg kg(-1) i.p.  pretreatment of rats with the central aadc inhibitor, nsd-1015 (100 mg/kg i.p.  administration of nsd-1015 (50-200 mg/kg i.p.  nsd-1015 pretreatment inhibited dopamine formation and elevated l-dopa levels in plasma.  pretreatment with nsd-1015 (10 - 50 mg kg(-1); i.p.)  subjects administered single doses of ndi-010976 at 20, 50, or 200 mg had significant inhibition of dnl compared to placebo (mean inhibition relative to placebo was 70%, 85%, and 104%, respectively).  the o-arylcarbamate urb597 (cyclohexylcarbamic acid 3'-carbamoylbiphenyl-3-yl ester; also referred to as kds-4103) is a potent inhibitor of fatty-acid amide hydrolase (faah), an intracellular serine hydrolase responsible for the inactivation of the endogenous cannabinoid anandamide.  however, the effects of nsd-1015 on l-dopa-induced motor activity are unclear as both increases and decreases have been reported.  nsd-1015 (50-200 mg/kg i.p.)  nsd-1015, therefore, may not be an appropriate tool for the study of brain aadc activity and for assessing the neuromodulatory role of l-dopa.  ndi-010976, an allosteric inhibitor of acetyl-coenzyme a carboxylases (acc) acc1 and acc2, reduces hepatic de novo lipogenesis (dnl) and favorably affects steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis in animal models of fatty liver disease.  we now investigate the effects of the centrally acting aromatic amino acid dopa decarboxylase (aadc) inhibitor nsd-1015 (3-hydroxybenzyl hydrazine) on the motor actions of l-dopa and dopamine agonist drugs in mptp treated common marmosets.  acc inhibition with a single dose of ndi-010976 is well tolerated and results in a profound dose-dependent inhibition of hepatic dnl in overweight adult male subjects.  some derivatives exhibited potent inhibitory activity against human 11β-hsd1, although with low selectivity over the isoenzyme 11β-hsd2, and poor microsomal stability.  ly290181 is a potent inhibitor of cell proliferation, producing 50% inhibition of vascular smooth muscle, endothelial, chinese hamster ovary, hela, and human erythroleukemia cells at concentrations of 8-40 nm.  lysine decarboxylase (ldc) catalyzes the first-step in the biosynthetic pathway of quinolizidine alkaloids (qas), which form a distinct, large family of plant alkaloids.  ay-994 (trans-1,4-bis-(2-chlorobenzyl-aminomethyl) cyclohexane dihydrochloride), a potent inhibitor of the enzymatic reduction of the delta 7-double bond of delta 5,7-sterols, has been shown to inhibit, at higher concentrations (10-4 m), the enzymatic reduction of the delta 14-double bond of cholesta-8,14-dien-3 beta-ol and cholesta-7,14-dien-3 beta-ol. ||| ",Yes
Is overproduction of transthyretin is associated with amyloidosis associated neuropathy?,Yes,"The overproduction of transthyretin (TTR) is indeed associated with amyloidosis-associated neuropathy, specifically familial amyloid polyneuropathy (FAP) and senile systemic amyloidosis (SSA). TTR is an amyloidogenic protein that can form amyloid fibrils, leading to the extracellular deposition of these fibrils in various tissues. In the context of FAP and SSA, these deposits occur predominantly in the peripheral nervous system, causing progressive impairment and neuropathy. The overproduction or misfolding of TTR can exacerbate this process, leading to the systemic accumulation of amyloid fibrils and subsequent organ dysfunction.","transthyretin is an amyloidogenic protein that causes human amyloid polyneuropathy and senile systemic amyloidosis as a result of the deposition of normal and/or mutant transthyretin in the form of amyloid fibrils.  mutations in transthyretin (ttr) are associated with familial amyloid polyneuropathy, a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by ttr deposition in the pns.  this is the first report showing the relationship between wild-type transthyretin deposition and aging in familial amyloid polyneuropathy patients.  transthyretin (ttr) is a homotetrameric plasma protein with amyloidogenic properties that has been linked to the development of familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy (fap), familial amyloidotic cardiomyopathy, and senile systemic amyloidosis.  misfolded and aggregated transthyretins (agttr) contribute to neurodegenerative amyloid diseases such as familial amyloid polyneuropathy and senile systemic amyloidosis.  transthyretin amyloidosis is a conformational pathology characterized by the extracellular formation of amyloid deposits and the progressive impairment of the peripheral nervous system.  transthyretin (ttr) is a plasma homotetrameric protein associated with senile systemic amyloidosis and familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy.  transthyretin (ttr)-related familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy, which is induced by amyloidogenic transthyretin (attr), is characterized by systemic accumulation of amyloid fibrils.  wild-type transthyretin is inherently an amyloidogenic protein, but its contribution to the formation of amyloid fibrils remains unclear in familial amyloid polyneuropathy patients.  transthyretin (ttr) is a protein linked to a number of different amyloid diseases including senile systemic amyloidosis and familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy.  human transthyretin (ttr) is a homotetrameric protein that is responsible for the formation of amyloid in patients with familiar amyloidotic polyneuropathy (fap), familiar amyloidotic cardiomyopathy (fac) and senile systemic amyloidosis (ssa).  our results indicate that wild-type transthyretin significantly contributes to the formation of amyloid fibrils in familial amyloid polyneuropathy patients with amyloidogenic transthyretin val30met, and its contribution tends to increase in older patients, suggesting that aging may play an important role in wild-type transthyretin-derived amyloid fibril formation in familial amyloid polyneuropathy patients.  transthyretin (ttr) is a homotetrameric protein that circulates in plasma and cerebral spinal fluid (csf) whose aggregation into amyloid fibrils has been associated with at least two different amyloid diseases: senile systemic amyloidosis (ssa) and familial amyloid polyneuropathy (fap).  variant forms of the plasma protein transthyretin (ttr) are associated with the most frequently occurring type of familial systemic amyloidosis.  the mutant amyloidogenic transthyretin protein causes the systemic accumulation of amyloid fibrils that result in organ dysfunction.  transthyretin (ttr) is an extracellular protein able to deposit into well-defined protein aggregates called amyloid, in pathological conditions known as senile systemic amyloidosis, familial amyloid polyneuropathy, familial amyloid cardiomyopathy and leptomeningeal amyloidosis.  transthyretin-related familial amyloid polyneuropathy (ttr-fap) is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by mutations of the transthyretin (ttr) gene.  our aim in this study was to elucidate the ratio of wild-type transthyretin in amyloid deposits in familial amyloid polyneuropathy patients.  transthyretin (ttr) is a major amyloid fibril protein found in patients with familial amyloidotic polynuropathy (fap) and senile systemic amyloidosis (ssa).  human transthyretin (httr), a serum protein with a main role in transporting thyroid hormones and retinol through binding to the retinol-binding protein, is an amyloidogenic protein involved in familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy (fap), familial amyloidotic cardiomyopathy, and central nervous system selective amyloidosis. ||| ",Yes
Does cucumber lower blood sugar in diabetics?,No,"The context provided discusses the effects of curcumin, a compound found in turmeric, on blood sugar levels and diabetes. It does not mention cucumber. The studies referenced in the context suggest that curcumin has potential benefits for glycemic control and lipid outcomes in prediabetes and type 2 diabetes. However, this information does not apply to cucumber, as it is a different substance with its own properties.

Is Dicer part of the RISC loading complex?,Yes,"Dicer, a specialized ribonuclease, is indeed a component of the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) loading complex. This enzyme, belonging to the RNase III family, is responsible for processing double-stranded RNA into small functional RNAs. The structure of Dicer, combined with biochemical data, has been used to propose a model for the architecture of the RISC-loading complex. Furthermore, recent findings indicate that Drosophila Dicer-1 and Dicer-2 are also components of siRNA-dependent RISC (siRISC). This evidence supports the role of Dicer as a key enzyme in the biogenesis of microRNAs and small interfering RNAs, and its involvement in the RISC loading complex.","dicer is a component of the protein machinery (the rna induced silencing complex ) which is involved in catalyzing the formation of mature micrornas from their precursors in the process of microrna biogenesis.  dicer is a member of the double-stranded (ds) rna-specific ribonuclease iii (rnase iii) family that is required for rna processing and degradation.  dicer is a specialized ribonuclease that processes double-stranded rna (dsrna) into small rna fragments about 25 nucleotides in length during the initiation phase of rna interference (rnai).  dicers are multidomain proteins, usually comprising an amino-terminal putative helicase domain, a duf283 domain (domain of unknown function), a paz domain, two rnase iii domains (rnase iiia and rnase iiib) and a dsrna-binding domain.  finally, we combine the structure of dicer with published biochemical data to propose a model for the architecture of the rna-induced silencing complex (risc)-loading complex.  it has been recently found that drosophila dicer-1 and dicer-2 are also components of sirna-dependent risc (sirisc).  dicer is one of the most important components in microrna biogenesis.  dicer or dicer-like (dcl) protein is a catalytic component involved in microrna (mirna) or small interference rna (sirna) processing pathway, whose fragment structures have been partially solved.  dicer is an enzyme of the rnase iii endoribonuclease family, which is crucial for rna interference (rnai) in eukaryotes.  dicer, a ribonuclease, is the key enzyme required for the biogenesis of micrornas and small interfering rnas and is essential for both mammalian development and cell differentiation.  like most members of the rnase iii family, dicer possesses a dsrna binding domain and cleaves long rna duplexes in vitro.  dicer is a member of the ribonuclease iii enzyme family and processes double-stranded rna into small functional rnas.  dicer, a member of the rnase iii family, is the key enzyme required for the biogenesis of micrornas and small interfering rnas.  loss of dicer1 affects different developmental processes.  recent evidence indicates that dicer may also be involved in tumourigenesis.  dicer1 is essential for retinal development and maintenance.  here we demonstrate that dsrnas undergo significant repositioning within dicer complexes following dicing.  here, we provide evidence that dicer is composed of three structurally rigid regions connected by flexible hinges and propose that conformational flexibility facilitates dsrna binding and processing.  the variation in the domain architecture of dicer among different species whilst preserving its biological dicing function is intriguing.  in organisms ranging from arabidopsis to humans, dicer requires dsrna-binding proteins (dsrbps) to carry out its roles in rna interference (rnai) and micro-rna (mirna) processing. ||| ",Yes
Is irritable bowel syndrome more common in women with endometriosis?,Yes,"The prevalence of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is higher in women with endometriosis compared to women without endometriosis. Women with endometriosis are 3.5 times more likely to receive a diagnosis of IBS than women without endometriosis. Additionally, women with minimal to mild and moderate to severe endometriosis have a higher prevalence of symptoms consistent with IBS compared to controls. The increased chances of having a diagnosis of IBS in women with endometriosis is not due to misdiagnosis, but rather co-morbidity. The unique symptom phenotype reported by women with concurrent endometriosis and IBS further supports the association between the two conditions.","irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) is also common in this setting, and it was speculated that the visceral hypersensitivity associated with this condition might be amplifying the symptoms of endometriosis.  both irritable bowel syndrome and endometriosis are common conditions, although symptomatic gastrointestinal endometriosis is extremely rare.  associations between endometriosis and irritable bowel syndrome (ibs), celiac disease, and various autoimmune diseases have been reported.  thus, this study found a higher prevalence of ibs in women with endometriosis compared to women without endometriosis.  the aim of this study was to compare the prevalence of ibs in women with endometriosis to the prevalence in women without endometriosis and to investigate if the prevalence of ibs was associated with bowel involved endometriosis.  gastrointestinal (gi) symptoms similar to irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) are often present in women with endometriosis and microscopic colitis (mc).  women with concurrent endometriosis and ibs report a unique symptom phenotype.  compared with the controls, women with endometriosis were 3.5 times more likely to have received a diagnosis of ibs (or 3.5 ).  to investigate whether the increased chances of having a diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) and pelvic inflammatory disease (pid) in women with endometriosis is due to misdiagnosis or co-morbidity.  the prevalence of ibs was higher in women with endometriosis compared to the women without endometriosis (or = 5.32 (ci: 2.88; 9.81)).  compared with controls, patients with minimal to mild and moderate to severe endometriosis had a higher prevalence of symptoms consistent with ibs (0% vs 65% and 50%, respectively, p<0.001) with significantly lower mean pain thresholds (39.5 mm hg (95% ci 36.0 to 43.0) vs 28.1 mm hg (95% ci 24.5 to 31.6), p=0.001 and 28.8 mm hg (95% ci 24.9 to 32.6), p=0.002) not explained by differences in rectal compliance.  women with endometriosis are more likely to be diagnosed with ibs and pid than controls, even after a definitive diagnosis of endometriosis has been reached.  cases were women with diagnoses of both endometriosis and ibd.  we report the case of a patient initially thought to have irritable bowel syndrome, in whom the diagnosis of endometriosis only became clear following a laparotomy for small bowel obstruction.  women presenting with pelvic endometriosis frequently report gastrointestinal complaints of increased intensity during menstruation, which are not necessarily linked to the infiltration of the disease into the rectal wall.  women with ibs experienced aggravated abdominal pain, diarrhea, bloating and flatulence, nausea and vomiting, the urgency to defecate, the sensation of incomplete evacuation and intestinal symptom's influence on daily life, and impaired psychological wellbeing, compared to women with endometriosis.  women with endometriosis are frequently misdiagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) for some time before a correct diagnosis is made.  in women presenting to gynaecological clinics with lower abdominal pain, the cause is frequently attributed to endometriosis irrespective of whether it is found to be minimal or extensive at laparoscopy.  intestinal endometriosis is typically asymptomatic; however, when symptoms occur, they can mimic those of irritable bowel syndrome.  inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) and endometriosis are immune-mediated chronic inflammatory disorders affecting young women. ||| ",Yes
Does splicing occur co-transcriptionally?,Yes,"The evidence from various experimental approaches indicates that splicing is a co-transcriptional process, occurring while RNA polymerase II is still transcribing. This coupling of transcription and splicing has been observed in drosophila, yeast, and mammals. The majority of intron-containing genes undergo cotranscriptional splicing, and the spliceosome assembly and splicing catalysis can also occur co-transcriptionally. The functional coupling of transcription and splicing has been reported both in vivo and in vitro, and the coupling between transcription and alternative splicing is an important layer of gene expression regulation. The timing of splicing is also important to control the splicing reaction, and nucleosome positioning may influence the inclusion of internal exon sequences. The coupling of transcription and splicing is possible because splicing is often cotranscriptional, and promoter identity and occupation may affect alternative splicing.","many splicing events occur co-transcriptionally when the pre-mrna is still associated with the transcription machinery.  splicing is a co-transcriptional process, and different experimental approaches show that splicing is coupled to transcription in drosophila, yeast and mammals.  in the last several years, a number of studies have shown that spliceosome assembly and splicing catalysis can occur co-transcriptionally.  surprisingly, we find that splicing occurs cotranscriptionally for the majority of intron-containing genes.  current evidence supports co-transcriptional spliceosomal assembly, but there is little quantitative information on how much splicing is completed during rna synthesis.  in metazoan organisms, pre-mrna splicing is thought to occur during transcription, and it is postulated that these two processes are functionally coupled via still-unknown mechanisms.  does splicing start while rna polymerase ii is still transcribing?  the functional coupling of transcription and splicing has been reported both in vivo and in vitro, but the molecular mechanisms governing these interactions remain largely unknown.  we discuss here the different mechanisms by which transcription regulates alternative splicing.  recent studies indicate that precursor mrna splicing occurs cotranscriptionally and that nucleosome positioning may influence inclusion of internal exon sequences.  is timing important to control the splicing reaction?  altogether, these findings provide evidence that coupling between transcription and alternative splicing is an important layer of gene expression regulation in plants.  mechanistic analyses of nuclear pre-mrna splicing by the spliceosome and group ii intron self-splicing provide insight into both the catalytic strategies of splicing and the evolutionary relationships between the different splicing systems.  these observations represent the first in vivo evidence for differential association of pre-mrna splicing factors with alternatively spliced transcripts.  splicing in s. cerevisiae has been shown to proceed cotranscriptionally, but the nature of the coupling remains a subject of debate.  increasing evidence suggests that pre-mrna splicing can take place cotranscriptionally in vivo.  alternative splicing regulation not only depends on the interaction of splicing factors with splicing enhancers and silencers in the pre-mrna, but also on the coupling between transcription and splicing.  this coupling is possible because splicing is often cotranscriptional and promoter identity and occupation may affect alternative splicing.  although previous studies suggest that transcription elongation can alter co-transcriptional pre-mrna splicing, we do not observe evidence of defective transcription elongation for these genes in the absence of gcn5, while gcn5-dependent histone acetylation is enriched in the promoter regions.  we show that distinct combinations of splicing factors are recruited to sites of alternatively spliced transcripts in intact cells. ||| ",Yes
"Can we detect DNA strand asymmetries using dinucleotide relative abundance ""genomic signatures""?",Yes,"The use of measures of compositional strand bias, such as dinucleotide relative abundance ""genomic signatures"", is crucial for quantifying the degree of strand asymmetry in DNA sequences. These measures can be used to determine the applicability of compositional analysis and compare the strength of the mutational bias in different biological machineries in various species. The compositional asymmetry of complementary bases in nucleotide sequences implies the existence of a mutational or selectional bias in the two strands of the DNA duplex, which is commonly shaped by strand-specific mechanisms in transcription or replication. Therefore, it is possible to utilize these characteristic properties to identify and detect DNA strand asymmetries.","dinucleotide relative abundances are considered an idiosyncratic feature of genomes, regarded as a 'genomic signature'.  motivated by this finding, we introduce the 'generalized genomic signatures' (ggss), composed of over- and under-abundances of all oligonucleotides of a given length, thus filtering out compositional trends and neighbour preferences at any shorter range.  the compositional asymmetry of complementary bases in nucleotide sequences implies the existence of a mutational or selectional bias in the two strands of the dna duplex, which is commonly shaped by strand-specific mechanisms in transcription or replication.  the use of measures of compositional strand bias in order to quantify the degree of strand asymmetry is crucial, as it is the basis for determining the applicability of compositional analysis and comparing the strength of the mutational bias in different biological machineries in various species.  here, we review the measures of strand bias that have been proposed to date, including the ∆gc skew, the b(1) index, the predictability score of linear discriminant analysis for gene orientation, the signal-to-noise ratio of the oligonucleotide bias, and the gc skew index.  curvature of the dna molecule occurs in dna regions with a specific type of nucleotide sequence periodicities.  in this paper we describe a simple approach using double peaks in chromatograms generated as artefacts in the vicinity of heterozygous indels, to identify the specific sequences present in individual strands of a given dna fragment.  the finding was supported by dna curvature and was prevalent in all core dna sequences.  we believe that this simple, low-cost and practical method could be useful towards identifying and detecting dna in biotechnology and pathology.  sensitive methods for the quantification of dna fragments can be used to study an individual's genetic constitution for duplicated regions of the genome or to determine the relative proportion of different dna fragments in heterogeneous samples such as pooled dna from different individuals or in samples in which a fraction of the chromosomes carry a mutation.  these results demonstrate the potential for utilizing simple surface modifications and existing biochemical moieties in individual nucleobases for a reliable, direct, single-molecule, nanoelectronic dna and rna nucleotide identification method for sequencing.  while many studies display a large ensemble of measurements as ""electronic fingerprints"" with some promise for distinguishing the dna and rna nucleobases (adenine, guanine, cytosine, thymine, and uracil), important metrics such as accuracy and confidence of base calling fall well below the current genomic methods.  by analyzing dinucleotide position-frequency data of yeast nucleosome-bound dna sequences, dinucleotide periodicities of core dna sequences were investigated.  it is possible to utilize these characteristic properties to identify/detect dna.  we describe a solution-based fluorescence method that discriminates between wild-type and mutant sequences using a dsdna binding dye, and interrogates a region of >200 nucleotides.  we describe two-dimensional strandness-dependent electrophoresis (2d-sde) for quantification and length distribution analysis of single-stranded (ss) dna fragments, double-stranded (ds) dna fragments, rna-dna hybrids, and nicked dna fragments in complex samples.  we utilize nper as a method to achieve >99.7% accuracy for dna and rna base calling at low molecular coverage (∼12×) using unbiased single measurements on dna/rna nucleotides, which represents a significant advance compared to existing sequencing methods.  dideoxy fingerprinting (ddf) is a hybrid technique which combines aspects of single strand conformational polymorphism (sscp) and dideoxy sequencing to detect the presence of single base changes in a defined fragment of nucleic acid.  for reasons not entirely understood, such dinucleotide repeats in genomic sequences have been associated with genomic instability leading to cancer.  dna molecules differing by as little as a single-base substitution have traditionally been distinguished by gel electrophoresis-based methodologies that exploit differences in the sequence-specific properties of double-stranded dna (dsdna) such as melting temperature and secondary conformational configuration. ||| ",No
Is Meis1 implicated in microphthalmia?,Yes,"Justification: The context suggests that Meis1 is implicated in microphthalmia. It is proposed to be at the core of a genetic network implicated in eye patterning and microphthalmia. Haploinsufficiency of Meis1, which encodes a transcription factor, is shown to cause microphthalmic traits and visual impairment in adult mice. In the eye primordium, Meis1 coordinates retinal proliferation and differentiation by regulating genes responsible for human microphthalmia and components of the notch signaling pathway.","we propose that meis1 is at the core of a genetic network implicated in eye patterning/microphthalmia, and represents an additional candidate for syndromic cases of these ocular malformations.  here we show that haploinsufficiency of meis1, which encodes a transcription factor with evolutionarily conserved expression in the embryonic trunk, brain and sensory organs, including the eye, causes microphthalmic traits and visual impairment in adult mice.  in the eye primordium, meis1 coordinates, in a dose-dependent manner, retinal proliferation and differentiation by regulating genes responsible for human microphthalmia and components of the notch signaling pathway.  microphthalmos, also called microphthalmia, is a rare developmental disorder of the eye that can be caused by genetic or chromosomal abnormalities or environmental factors.  thus, deregulated msx2 gene expression may be a plausible genetic mechanism by which the autosomal dominant form of congenital microphthalmia may arise.  the possible role of p.(arg62cys) and p.(gly220arg) in microphthalmia is similarly supported by the observed functional defects, with or without an additional impact from noncoding mab21l1 variants identified in each patient.  we present a likely causative novel variant in mab21l1, c.152g>t p.(arg51leu), in two family members with microphthalmia and aniridia, as well as novel or rare compound heterozygous variants of uncertain significance, c.184c>t p.(arg62cys)/c.-68t>c, and c.658g>c p.(gly220arg)/c.  microphthalmia with limb anomalies (mla, omim, 206920) is a rare autosomal-recessive disease caused by biallelic pathogenic variants in the smoc1 gene.  microphthalmia (mi) is a bhlhzip transcription factor that is essential for melanocyte development and postnatal function.  isolated microphthalmia is a model disease for studying early development of the human eye, and mutations in several key genes related to eye development have been linked to this phenotype.  the roles of microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (mitf) in the skeletal muscle and during myogenesis are unclear.  these data show that x-linked recessive syndromic microphthalmia exhibits genetic heterogeneity.  microphthalmos is a rare congenital anomaly characterized by reduced eye size and visual deficits of variable degree.  microphthalmia is a relatively common ocular malformation.  microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (mitf) is critically involved in melanin synthesis as well as differentiation of cells of the melanocytic lineage.  in our search for novel genes that cause autosomal recessive microphthalmia when mutated, we enrolled a family that consists of third-cousin parents and two children with isolated colobomatous microphthalmia.  the spectrum of clinical presentation includes nanophthalmia and posterior microphthalmia.  here we observed widespread meis2 expression in the developing palate in mice.  microphthalmia is a condition in which eyes are small in size, often associated with coloboma, as a result of aberrant eye development.  the microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (mitf) is a member of the myc family of basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper transcription factors. ||| ",Yes
Are sleep apnea and snoring associated with cardiac arrhythmias?,Yes,"Sleep apnea and snoring have been identified as significant factors in the development of cardiac arrhythmias. The recurrent intermittent hypoxia and sympathetic nervous system activity surges associated with sleep-disordered breathing provide a conducive environment for the development of cardiac arrhythmias. Nocturnal cardiac arrhythmias are a common clinical feature of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, with patients exhibiting more exaggerated cardiac arrhythmias than control subjects. The prevalence of nocturnal cardiac arrhythmias is higher among subjects with sleep-disordered breathing than those without. The treatment of sleep apnea usually results in the resolution of brady-arrhythmias. Patients with ventricular arrhythmias should be systematically assessed for sleep apnea due to the potential detrimental effects of sleep apnea in the follow-up period.","various cardiac arrhythmias frequently occur in patients with sleep apnea, but complex analysis of the relationship between their severity and the probable arrhythmogenic risk factors is conflicting.  the objective of this study was to identify relationships between sleep apnea, myocardial ischemia and cardiac arrhythmia in patients with coronary artery disease.  in conclusion, sleep apnea modifying cardiovascular risk factors and structures or functions provoked various nocturnal arrhythmias.  according to several studies, obstructive sleep apnea predisposes to cardiac arrhythmias, but the prevalence of sleep apnea in specific arrhythmias has not been determined.  we postulate that the prevalence of nocturnal cardiac arrhythmias is higher among subjects with than without sleep-disordered breathing.  nocturnal cardiac arrhythmia is a common clinical feature of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome.  moderate sleep apnea patients had benign, but more exaggerated cardiac arrhythmias than control subjects (2.53 ± 2.49 vs. 1.13 ± 1.64 degrees of cumulative severity, p < 0.05).  to compare the frequency of daytime and nocturnal cardiac arrhythmias and st-segment depression episodes among patients with obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome (osahs), snoring subjects, and healthy subjects, and to analyze the relationship between the cardiac disturbances, sleep characteristics, and sympathetic tone in patients with osahs.  in this review we highlight the role of obstructive sleep apnea and cheyne-stokes respiration in the pathophysiology of arrhythmias, address their clinical effect in supraventricular and ventricular tachyarrhythmias, and in conduction disturbances, and address the role of current treatment options for sleep-disordered breathing in the primary and secondary prevention of arrhythmic events.  nocturnal cardiac arrhythmias occur in patients with obstructive sleep apnea (osa), reportedly as a consequence of the autonomic effects of recurrent apnea with subsequent oxygen desaturation.  sleep-disordered breathing recurrent intermittent hypoxia and sympathetic nervous system activity surges provide the milieu for cardiac arrhythmia development.  however, the association between sleep apnea and ventricular arrhythmias is unclear.  the purpose of this study was to determine if patients referred for pacemaker therapy with asymptomatic bradyarrhythmias have underlying sleep apnea as the etiology of their bradyarrhythmias.  over the past few years sleep-disordered breathing has been identified as an important factor in arrhythmogenesis and a potential target of therapy to prevent cardiac arrhythmias in selected patients.  there is controversy regarding whether obstructive sleep apnea is responsible for triggering myocardial ischemia, arrhythmias and heart rate variability in patients with coronary artery disease.  this study sought to evaluate respiratory disturbances as potential triggers for arrhythmia in patients with sleep-disordered breathing (sdb).  the arrhythmias usually occur during sleep and contribute to the cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and the treatment of sleep apnea usually results in the resolution of the brady- arrhythmias.  patients with ventricular arrhythmias should be systematically assessed for sleep apnea owing to the potential detrimental effects of sleep apnea in the follow-up period.  sinus arrest, atrio-ventricular block, supraventricular, and ventricular arrhythmias have been reported in patients with sleep apnea syndrome.  sleep-disordered breathing is a common condition associated with nocturnal hypoxaemia, sympathetic activation and haemodynamic stress that can trigger arrhythmias. ||| ",Yes
Is Lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) a critical regulator of hematopoiesis?,Yes,"Lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) plays a crucial role in the regulation of hematopoiesis. It functions as a transcriptional coregulator by modulating histone methylation and participates in transcriptional repression or activation. LSD1 is a histone demethylase that targets mono- or di-methylated histone H3K4 and H3K9, as well as non-histone substrates. Integrative genomic analysis reveals that LSD1 represses hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) gene expression programs during hematopoietic differentiation. Furthermore, LSD1 has been reported to repress and activate transcription by mediating histone H3K4me1/2 and H3K9me1/2 demethylation, respectively. Therefore, LSD1 is a critical regulator of hematopoiesis.","lysine-specific demethylase 1 (lsd1) is a histone modifier for transcriptional repression involved in the regulation of hematopoiesis.  here, we describe that lysine-specific demethylase 1 (lsd1/kdm1a), which demethylates histone h3 on lys4 or lys9 (h3k4/k9), is an indispensible epigenetic governor of hematopoietic differentiation.  lysine-specific demethylase 1 (lsd1) has been identified and biochemically characterized in epigenetics; however, the pathological roles of its dysfunction in mantle cell lymphoma (mcl) and t-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia remain to be elucidated.  lysine-specific demethylase 1 (lsd1), which has been considered as a potential therapeutic target in human cancer, has been known to regulate many biological functions through its non-histone substrates.  lysine-specific demethylase 1 (lsd1) downregulates eukaryotic gene activity by demethylating mono- and dimethylated lys4 in histone h3.  lysine-specific demethylase 1 (lsd1) functions as a transcriptional coregulator by modulating histone methylation.  lysine-specific demethylase 1(lsd1), the first identified histone demethylase, plays an important role in the epigenetic regulation of gene activation and repression.  lysine-specific demethylase 1 (lsd1) is a histone demethylase that participates in transcriptional repression or activation.  the lysine-specific demethylase 1 (lsd1), a component of several histone deacetylase complexes, plays an important role in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation.  integrative genomic analysis, combining global occupancy of lsd1, genome-wide analysis of its substrates h3k4 monomethylation and dimethylation, and gene expression profiling, reveals that lsd1 represses hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (hspc) gene expression programs during hematopoietic differentiation.  lysine-specific demethylase 1 (lsd1) targets mono- or di-methylated histone h3k4 and h3k9 as well as non-histone substrates and functions in the regulation of gene expression as a transcriptional repressor or activator.  lysine-specific demethylase 1 (lsd1) has been reported to repress and activate transcription by mediating histone h3k4me1/2 and h3k9me1/2 demethylation, respectively.  lysine specific demethylase 1 (lsd1) catalyzes the demethylation of histone 3 to regulate gene expression.  lysine-specific demethylase 1 (lsd1) is an enzyme that removes methyl groups from mono- and dimethylated lys4 of histone h3, a post-translational modification associated with gene activation.  it is well-established that lysine-specific demethylase 1 (lsd1) is the first identified histone demethylase.  histone lysine specific demethylase 1 (lsd1) is the first histone demethylase to be discovered, which regulates various biological functions by making lysine of histone h3k4, h3k9 and non-histone substrates demethylated.  lysine-specific demethylase 1 (lsd1) is a flavin adenine dinucleotide (fad)-dependent enzyme that catalyzes the demethylation of histone h3 and regulates gene expression.  lysine-specific demethylase 1 (lsd1/aof2/kdm1a), the first enzyme with specific lysine demethylase activity to be described, demethylates histone and non-histone proteins and is essential for mouse embryogenesis.  lysine-specific demethylase 1 (lsd1/aof2/kdm1a), the first enzyme with specific lysine demethylase activity to be described, demethylates histone and non-histone proteins and is essential for mouse embryogenesis.  based on its demethylase enzymatic activity, lsd1 plays a pivotal role in vast range of cellular processes and cancers, but the understanding of its effects on inflammation is relatively limited. ||| ",Yes
Is RET the major gene involved in Hirschsprung disease?,Yes,"The RET proto-oncogene is indeed considered the major susceptibility gene involved in Hirschsprung disease. It is the most frequently affected gene in Hirschsprung disease, with mutations in the RET gene being the primary cause. The involvement of the RET gene in the pathogenesis of Hirschsprung disease is supported by experimental evidence, including the production of intestinal aganglionosis in mice with a null mutation of this gene and the increased evidence of RET mutations in patients with Hirschsprung disease. The RET gene is also a major locus involved in the complex genetics of Hirschsprung disease, showing causative loss-of-function mutations in 15-30% of sporadic cases. Furthermore, RET common variants are associated with Hirschsprung disease, and the gene contains >80% of all known disease-causing mutations.","the ret proto-oncogene is considered to be the major susceptibility gene involved in hirschsprung disease.  ret is the major gene associated to hirschsprung disease (hscr) with differential contributions of its rare and common, coding and noncoding mutations to the multifactorial nature of this pathology.  although the ret proto-oncogene is the most frequently affected gene in hirschsprung disease, rare coding sequence variants explain only a small part of hirschsprung disease cases.  mutations in the ret gene are the primary cause of hirschsprung disease (hscr), or congenital intestinal aganglionosis.  the ret proto-oncogene is a major cause of hirschsprung's disease (hd) as demonstrated by the experimentally produced intestinal aganglionosis in mice with a null mutation of this gene and by the increased evidence of ret mutations in patients with hd.  as expected, variants in or near ret showed the strongest overall association with hirschsprung disease and the most statistically significant association was observed when using a recessive genetic model (rs2435357, nc_000010.10:g.43582056t > c; genotype tt, or = 17.31, p = 1.462 × 10-21).  the ret proto-oncogene is the major gene involved in the complex genetics of hirschsprung disease (hscr), or aganglionic megacolon, showing causative loss-of-function mutations in 15-30% of the sporadic cases.  the ret proto-oncogene is the major gene involved in the pathogenesis of hirschsprung (hscr), a complex genetic disease characterized by lack of ganglia along variable lengths of the gut.  traditional ret germline mutations account for a small subset of hirschsprung disease patients, but several studies have shown that there is a specific haplotype of ret associated with the sporadic forms of hirschsprung disease.  ret common variants are associated with hirschsprung disease (hscr; colon aganglionosis), a congenital defect of the enteric nervous system.  ret is the major causative gene and contains > 80% of all known disease-causing mutations.  we aimed to assess the genetic background of hirschsprung disease using a genome-wide association analysis combined with sequencing all ret exons in samples from 105 hirschsprung disease cases (30 familial and 75 sporadic) and 386 controls.  hirschsprung disease (hscr) is a complex genetic defect of intestinal innervation mainly ascribed to loss of function mutations of the ret gene.  the pathogenesis of hirschsprung disease is complex.  germline mutations of the ret proto-oncogene (ret), its ligand glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (gdnf), and neurturin (ntn) gene have been reported in patients with hirschsprung's disease.  recent advances show that the ret gene is a major locus involved in the pathogenesis of hscr.  a significant over-transmission of the ""hirschsprung disease haplotype"" was detected when comparing transmitted versus nontransmitted alleles in the group of hirschsprung disease triads without mutation.  because expression of ret mrna plays an important role in establishing the enteric neuronal lineage, decreased ret mrna expression in the aganglionic bowel may suggest maldevelopment of neural crest-derived cells in hirschsprung's disease.  hirschsprung disease (hscr) stands as a model for genetic dissection of complex diseases.  here we present a survey of the different molecular mechanisms through which ret mutations lead to the disease development. ||| ",Yes
Is rucaparib used for ovarian cancer treatment?,Yes,"Rucaparib, a poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor, has been approved for use in the treatment of recurrent ovarian cancer. Clinical trials have demonstrated its efficacy in improving progression-free survival in patients with platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer who have achieved a response to platinum-based chemotherapy. Rucaparib has shown single-agent antitumor activity in patients with high-grade ovarian carcinoma, including those with BRCA mutations and homologous recombination deficiency. Its use has been associated with statistically significant reductions in tumor size in patients with highly malignant tumors and relapses on platinum-based chemotherapy. Rucaparib is increasingly being utilized for women with recurrent ovarian cancer both as treatment and maintenance therapy, irrespective of genetic mutation.","introduction: rucaparib is increasingly being utilized for women with recurrent ovarian cancer both as treatment and maintenance therapy.  rucaparib is a drug with potential as maintenence monotherapy in ovarian cancers irrespective of genetic mutation.  to review the pharmacology, safety, efficacy, and the role of rucaparib in the treatment of relapsed, advanced ovarian cancer.  these results support further clinical evaluation of rucaparib either as a single agent or as an adjunct to chemotherapy for the treatment of sporadic ovarian cancer.  implications for practice: rucaparib was recently approved in the u.s. and european union for use as treatment or maintenance for recurrent ovarian cancer.  rucaparib as a maintenance treatment showed increased progression-free survival in patients with ovarian carcinoma who achieved a response to platinum-based chemotherapy, with an acceptable safety profile.  rucaparib appears to be a safe and effective new option in the treatment of relapsed, advanced brca1/2 mutant ovarian cancer.  rucaparib, a polyadpribose polymerase inhibitor (parpi), was approved recently for use in women with high-grade serous ovarian cancer (hgsoc).  a total of 2 phase i/ii trials and 1 phase ii trial have evaluated the safety and efficacy of oral rucaparib in ovarian cancer.  across all primary analysis groups, rucaparib significantly improved progression-free survival in patients with platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer who had achieved a response to platinum-based chemotherapy.  understanding and appropriate management of potential side effects associated with rucaparib may allow patients with ovarian cancer to continue to benefit from rucaparib treatment.  drawing on the authors' clinical experience with rucaparib, rucaparib prescribing information, and published supportive cancer care guidelines, this review discusses how to optimally manage common rucaparib-associated side effects in patients with advanced ovarian cancer in the real-world oncology setting.  phase ii and iii trials have documented that rucaparib has single-agent antitumor activity in patients with high-grade ovarian carcinoma, with both brca-mutated (germline and somatic) and with homologous recombination deficiency (hrd).  rucaparib, a poly(adp-ribose) polymerase inhibitor, has anticancer activity in recurrent ovarian carcinoma harbouring a brca mutation or high percentage of genome-wide loss of heterozygosity.  ovarian cancer patients with highly malignant tumors and relapses on platinum based chemotherapy exhibited statistically significant reductions in tumor size with maintenance rucaparib therapy vis a vis placebo.  here, we investigate the potential role of the parp inhibitor rucaparib (co-338, formerly known as ag014699 and pf-01367338) for the treatment of sporadic ovarian cancer.  in the current study we investigated the inhibitory effect of rucaparib (rubraca®) on human ovarian cancer skov3 and a2780 cells and its possible mechanism.  in ariel3 (nct01968213), the poly(adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase inhibitor rucaparib significantly improved progression-free survival versus placebo regardless of biomarker status when used as maintenance treatment for recurrent ovarian cancer.  treatment options for women with recurrent ovarian cancer who have received two or more prior lines of chemotherapy have recently expanded with the u.s. food and drug administration (fda) and european commission (ec) approvals of the poly(adp-ribose) polymerase (parp) inhibitor rucaparib.  in this trial we assessed rucaparib versus placebo after response to second-line or later platinum-based chemotherapy in patients with high-grade, recurrent, platinum-sensitive ovarian carcinoma. ||| ",Yes
Is the petrous bone used in ancient DNA sampling?,Yes,"Justification: The petrous bone, specifically the petrous portion of the temporal bone, has been shown to be an excellent skeletal element for long-term ancient endogenous DNA survival. Its high endogenous DNA content and better quality compared to other bones have made it a preferred substrate in ancient DNA studies. The cochlea, located inside the petrous pyramid, is currently the most sought after skeletal element for molecular analyses of ancient humans due to its high amounts of endogenous DNA. The use of petrous bones in ancient DNA analyses has been confirmed to yield better DNA content and quality, and histological analyses have revealed unique microstructural characteristics that might explain the good preservation of DNA in this substrate.","because the practice of forensic genetics responds to different imperatives, we implemented a study aimed at (i) understanding how and why the petrous bone is an advantageous substrate in ancient dna studies and (ii) establishing whether it is advantageous in forensic str typing.  our primary aim is to assess the applicability of a petrous bone sampling method in combination with next generation sequencing to evaluate the quality and quantity of dna in taphonomically degraded petrous bones from forensic and cemetery cases.  the petrous portion of the temporal bone has been shown to be the most suitable skeletal part for sampling archaeological skeletons, and it has also been used successfully in some forensic cases.  over the last few years, palaeogenomic studies of the petrous bone (the densest part of the temporal bone) have shown that it is a source of dna in both larger quantities and of better quality than other bones.  in contrast, no pathogen dna has been reported from the petrous bone which has become the most desired skeletal element in ancient dna research due to its high endogenous dna content.  the significant role of the petrous bone in sex assessment of skeletal human remains has been highlighted by several studies.  therefore, it appears that despite the necessity of analysing longer fragments in forensic str typing compared to ngs palaeogenomics, the use of petrous bones in forensic genetics could prove valuable, especially in cases involving infants, toothless individuals or very degraded skeletal remains.  our results imply that although petrous bones are highly valuable for ancient genomic analyses as an excellent source of endogenous dna, the metagenomic potential of these dense skeletal elements is highly limited.  this paper aims to outline the possible biases of utilizing petrous bones to undertake adna analyses and highlight how these complications may potentially be overcome in future research.  a large proportion of adna work now utilizes the petrous portion of the temporal bone (pars petrosa), which is recognized as an excellent skeletal element for long-term ancient endogenous (host) dna survival.  through comparison of human dna content and quality we confirm best performance of the petrous pyramid and identify seven additional sampling locations across four skeletal elements that yield adequate adna for most applications in human palaeogenetics.  currently, the cochlea, part of the osseous inner ear located inside the petrous pyramid, is the most sought after skeletal element for molecular analyses of ancient humans as it has been shown to yield high amounts of endogenous dna.  for this reason, we were more likely to obtain a complete str profile from petrous bone material, increasing the chance of identification in a forensic setting.  to further improve the sampling strategy in dna analysis of aged skeletal remains, a comparison between 26 petrous bones and 30 metacarpals iii from second world war skeletons was made considering intra-bone dna yield variability.  we selected 50 individual skeletal remains and extracted dna from one tooth and one petrous bone from each.  using a systematic process of bone removal based on distinct anatomical landmarks and the identification of relevant morphological features, a petrous pyramid is cleaned with a sandblaster, and the cochlea is located, isolated, and reduced to a homogeneous bone powder.  histological analyses revealed peculiar microstructural characteristics (tissue organization), unique to the petrous bone, that might explain the good preservation of dna in that substrate.  we also performed histological analyses to compare (i) the microscopic structure of a petrous bone and of a tooth and (ii) the microscopic structure of fresh petrous bone and of an archaeological or forensic sample.  here, an ancient dna methodology using high-throughput sequencing is developed to survey and analyse thousands of archaeological bones from southwest australia.  we show that the rfu intensities read on str profiles are systematically higher in experiments using dna extracted from petrous bones rather than teeth. ||| ",Yes
Can CD55 deficiency cause thrombosis?,Yes,"The context suggests that CD55 deficiency can contribute to thrombosis, as it is a complement regulatory protein that protects cells from bystander lysis by complement. The loss of CD55 expression can lead to complement hyperactivation and overactivation of innate immunity, which can provoke severe impairment to host tissues. In the context of autoimmune diseases, complement activation has been associated with diminished CD55 and/or CD59 expression on peripheral blood cell membranes. Furthermore, deficiencies of other protein C system proteins are known to cause thrombotic disease, and defects in the gene coding for thrombomodulin (TM) could be responsible for inherited thrombophilia. Therefore, it is plausible that CD55 deficiency could contribute to thrombosis.","loss of cd55 expression in those patients compromises the complement regulatory function, thereby accelerating rbc lysis.  this could suggest a mechanism (could be genetic) responsible for low cd55 expression.  moreover, cd55 deficiency on red cells influences hemoglobin concentration.  this study provides evidence supporting the presence of erythrocytes with cd55 and/or cd59 deficiency in patients with rheumatic diseases.  interestingly, the majority of patients (104/113, 92%) demonstrated cd55- and/or cd59-deficient erythrocytes: 47 (41.6%) with concomitant deficiency of cd55 and cd59, 50 (44.2%) with isolated deficiency of cd55, and 6 (6.2%) with isolated deficiency of cd59.  complement hyperactivation, angiopathic thrombosis and protein-losing enteropathy (chaple disease) is a lethal disease caused by genetic loss of the complement regulatory protein cd55, leading to overactivation of complement and innate immunity together with immunodeficiency due to immunoglobulin wasting in the intestine.  cd55 is a complement regulatory protein expressed by cells to protect them from bystander lysis by complement.  however, cd55 expression significantly influenced hemoglobin values (f=6.092, p=0.015).  in this study, we aimed to evaluate the expression of cd55 on erythrocytes of β-thal patients.  in contrast to observations in many inflammatory disease models, lack of cd55 resulted in decreased arthritis in experimental models of ra.  complement has the potential to provoke severe impairment to host tissues, as shown in autoimmune diseases where complement activation has been associated with diminished cd55 and/or cd59 expression on peripheral blood cell membranes.  since deficiencies of other protein c system proteins are known to cause thrombotic disease, then defects in the gene coding for tm could be responsible for inherited thrombophilia.  in the cases reported so far, congenital isolated cd59 deficiency was associated with recurrent episodes of hemolytic anemia, peripheral neuropathy, and strokes.  cd55, cd59, cd35 and cd46 are cell membrane proteins that have regulatory properties on the activation of the complement cascade.  these results suggest there is an altered pattern of cd55 and cd59 expression on the peripheral blood cells of sle patients, and it may play a role in the cytopenias in these patients.  this study was undertaken to investigate the role of cd55 in experimental ra.  however, cd55 is also expressed in normal tissues, body fluids and stroma, limiting the use of anti-cd55 therapeutic antibodies.  flow cytometry analysis of cd55 was conducted on rbcs of 21 β-thalassemia major (β-tm) patients, 11 β-thalassemia intermedia (β-ti) patients and 10 healthy volunteers.  here, we demonstrate that cd55-deficient mice display a comparable phenotype with about two-fold more circulating granulocytes in the blood stream, the marginated pool, and the spleen.  the results showed a significant decrease in cd55 expression in β-tm (57.5 ± 16.7%), while there was a slight decrease in β-ti patients (81.8 ± 3.8%) in comparison with that of the normal controls (88.7 ± 0.8%). ||| ",Yes
Is treatment resistant depression related to vitamin B9?,No,"The context provided does not establish a direct relationship between treatment-resistant depression and vitamin B9 (folate). However, it does indicate that deficiencies in both vitamin B12 and folate have been associated with depression. Baseline vitamin B12 and folate levels were obtained in patients with treatment-resistant major depressive disorder and bipolar depression. The results showed that vitamin B12 supplementation with antidepressants significantly improved depressive symptoms in the cohort. However, the context does not provide information on the role of vitamin B9 in treatment-resistant depression specifically. Therefore, based on the given context, it cannot be concluded that treatment-resistant depression is related to vitamin B9.","recent literature has identified links between vitamin b12 deficiency and depression.we compared the clinical response of ssri-monotherapy with that of b12-augmentation in a sample of depressed patients with low normal b12 levels who responded inadequately to the first trial with the ssris.  an association between vitamin b12 levels and depressive symptoms (ds) has been reported in several epidemiological studies.  we report a case of vitamin b12 deficiency presenting with recurrent episodes of depression.  deficiencies in both vitamin b12 and folate have been associated with depression.  baseline vitamin b12 and folate levels were obtained in 49 inpatients with treatment-resistant mdd and 34 inpatients with treatment-resistant bipolar depression currently experiencing a major depressive episode.  vitamin b12 supplementation with antidepressants significantly improved depressive symptoms in our cohort.  to determine whether vitamins b6, b12 and folic acid enhance response to antidepressant treatment over 52 weeks.  our results do not support the hypothesis that a low dietary intake of b(6-9-12) vitamins and high levels of serum homocysteine are related to depression in healthy elderly men.  we confirm literature data regarding the link between bdnf plasma levels, depression and antidepressant treatments.  recently, higher baseline vitamin b12 levels were observed in individuals with bipolar depression who responded to the antidepressant ketamine at 7 days post-infusion.  melancholic ds and vitamin b12 levels showed an independent linearly inverse association.  we investigated whether a low dietary intake of b(6-9-12) vitamins and high levels of serum homocysteine are associated with depressive symptoms in elderly men.  vitamin b12 and homocysteine have been shown to be associated with depression or depressive symptoms, but the relationship has not been universal.  it is possible that low levels of vitamin b12 or holotranscobalamin are associated with depressive symptoms via mechanisms other than vascular pathology.  although many studies found an association between psychiatric disorders, especially major depressive disorder, and vitamin d deficiency, little is still known about the association between vitamin d and bipolar disorder (bd).  b vitamins did not increase the 12-week efficacy of antidepressant treatment, but enhanced and sustained antidepressant response over 1 year.  moreover, although an association between vitamin d levels and clinical symptomatology was observed in bd patients, it cannot be considered a specific marker of this disorder but a common characteristic shared with other psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia and major depressive disorder.  lower levels of holotranscobalamin and vitamin b12 were associated with higher levels of depressive symptoms when controlled for mini-mental state examination scores and psychosocial and cardiovascular risk factors.  this study sought to -replicate this result by correlating peripheral vitamin levels with ketamine's antidepressant efficacy in bipolar depression and major depressive disorder (mdd).  high plasma homocysteine has been consistently associated with depression, and treatment with certain b vitamins demonstrably reduces its concentration. ||| ",Yes

The correlation between EZH2 expression levels and an adverse prostate cancer prognosis suggests its strong prognostic impact. EZH2 expression in prostate cancer is also correlated with progression to hormone-refractory and metastatic disease. Furthermore, EZH2 analysis might be of clinical value for risk stratification of prostate cancer. The question remains whether overexpression of EZH2 can initiate prostate tumorigenesis or drive tumor progression.","overexpression of ezh2 protein has been associated with biological malignancy of prostate cancer and several other cancers.  ezh2 has strong prognostic impact in prostate cancer and might contribute to the development of a fraction of genetically instable and particularly aggressive prostate cancers.  in the current study, we analyzed prevalence and prognostic impact of ezh2 in prostate cancer.  ezh2 promotes proliferation and invasion of prostate cancer cells, which can account for the correlation between ezh2 expression levels and an adverse prostate cancer prognosis.  ezh2 expression in prostate cancer correlates with progression to hormone-refractory and metastatic disease, but it is unknown whether ezh2 plays a specific role in the acquisition of an advanced prostate cancer phenotype.  associations between ezh2 expression in malignant and benign tissue in prostate biopsy cores and outcomes were investigated using univariate and multivariate cox regression analyses.  ezh2 knockdown also inhibited prostate cancer cell invasion.  our findings have revealed a genetic mechanism resulting in enhanced ezh2 expression during the progression of aggressive prostate cancer, with important implications for understanding how to target advanced disease where cancer progenitor cells may be critical.  ezh2 analysis might therefore be of clinical value for risk stratification of prostate cancer.  however, the question remains whether overexpression of ezh2 can initiate prostate tumourigenesis or drive tumour progression.  overexpression of the enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (ezh2) protein, a known repressor of gene transcription, has been reported to be associated with biological malignancy of prostate cancer and several other cancers.  ezh2 expression was analyzed by immunohistochemistry on a tissue microarray containing more than 12400 prostate cancer specimens.  knockdown of endogenous ezh2 reduced proliferation of androgen-responsive and androgen-independent prostate cancer cells.  ezh2 mrna expression density in the metastatic prostate cancer group was significantly higher than in the control (p=0.023) and localized prostate cancer groups (p=0.019).  ezh2 binds hnf1b locus and suppresses hnf1b expression in prostate cancer cell lines, which is further supported by the reverse correlation between ezh2 and hnf1b expression in clinical samples.  most insights into the functional role of ezh2 in prostate cancer have been gained using cell lines and ezh2 inactivation studies.  while there was no significant association between ezh2 expression and biochemical recurrence following radiotherapy, univariate analysis revealed that prostate cancer cytoplasmic and total ezh2 expression were significantly associated with metastasis development postradiotherapy (p = 0.034 and p = 0.003, respectively).  these results suggest that overexpression of ezh2 is correlated with malignant potential and poor prognosis in osccs.  ezh2 expression was investigated using immunohistochemistry in diagnostic prostate biopsies of 113 prostate cancer patients treated with radiotherapy with curative intent.  in this study, we analyzed ezh2 mrna in circulating tumor cells (ctcs) in peripheral blood as a biomarker in patients with metastatic prostate cancer. ||| ",Yes
Is CD56 useful in Ewing sarcoma prognosis?,Yes,"The study indicates that CD56 expression on Ewing sarcoma cells can be used to identify patients with an excellent prognosis or those predisposed to relapse. This is supported by the finding that lack of CD56 expression is associated with a poor prognosis in multiple myeloma patients treated with conventional chemotherapy. The use of CD56 expression as a prognostic marker, in combination with other established prognostic factors, can improve treatment stratification and implementation of personalized therapy. However, it is important to note that the study also found that lack of CD56 expression on multiple myeloma cells is not a prognostic marker in patients treated with high-dose chemotherapy. Nonetheless, the study suggests that CD56 expression has potential as a prognostic marker in Ewing sarcoma, and further research is warranted to confirm its utility.","cd56 and cd57 are commonly considered as natural killer and neuroectodermal markers, but their expression has been identified in a wide spectrum of neoplasms including some cases of ewing's sarcoma (es) and primitive neuroectodermal tumor (pnet).  by cox regression analysis, cd56 was found to be an independent prognostic marker with an 11-fold increased risk for relapse in patients with localized disease (p = 0.006).  mm cells of 99 patients prior to treatment with high-dose chemotherapy were analysed for cd56 expression by flow cytometry.  aim of our retrospective study was to analyse whether cd56 expression on mm cells reveals as a prognostic factor in patients treated with high-dose chemotherapy.  early detection of metastasis and recurrence of ewing sarcoma (es) is important for early management.  lack of cd56 expression was reported to be associated with a poor prognosis in multiple myeloma (mm) patients treated with conventional chemotherapy.  thirty patients (32%) showed cd56 expression.  ewing sarcoma (es) is a highly malignant pediatric tumor with a low survival rate and a high rate of metastasis.  cd56 expression could be used to reveal es patients with excellent prognosis or patients predisposed to relapse, thus improving treatment stratification and implementation of personalized therapy.  combined with other well-established prognostic factors such as wbc count, cd56 expression at diagnosis might be used to build prognostic scores for risk-adapted therapy in apl.  we investigated the prognostic relevance of cd56 in a series of patients with apl who were treated homogeneously with all-trans-retinoic acid (atra) and chemotherapy.  this study demonstrated the prognostic value of cd56 and cd117 in patients with newly diagnosed mm patients.  the literature on cd56 and cd57 expression in es/pnet is reviewed and discussed.  the objective of the current study was to evaluate whether the presence of p16(ink4a) alteration is associated with a poorer prognosis in patients with ewing sarcomas.  in summary, our results indicate that lack of cd56 expression on mm cells is not a prognostic marker in patients treated with high-dose chemotherapy, but is associated with t(11;14).  multiparameter flow cytometry (mpfc) was used to detect es cells in bone marrow (bm) of es patients at diagnosis and to evaluate the prognostic significance of cd56 expression in bm samples.  the presence of p16(ink4a) alteration was a statistically significant predictor of prognosis for patients with ewing sarcoma.  our aim was to evaluate whether telomere length could be a better prognostic factor in ewing sarcoma and correlate the results with clinical variables, outcome, and chromosomal instability.  the expression of cd56 is significantly associated with inferior cr duration and survival in patients with apl who were treated with modern frontline treatment that included atra and simultaneous chemotherapy.  we suggest that reduction of telomere length in tumor cells at diagnosis could serve as a prognostic marker in ewing sarcoma. ||| ",Yes
Are there any urine biomarkers for bladder cancer diagnosis?,Yes,"Numerous molecular urine markers for the diagnosis of bladder cancer have been developed and evaluated, with the goal of complementing or even replacing cystoscopy. These markers include potential biochemical markers excreted in the urine of bladder cancer patients, as well as putative metabolite markers selected through comparative urine metabolomics. While none alone has yet proven to be useful as a screening procedure for the detection of urothelial cancer, the appropriate use of these approaches has the potential to provide efficient biomarkers for the early detection and monitoring of recurrent bladder cancer. Markers for aberrant methylation may also be a potential gateway for monitoring bladder cancer. However, well-designed protocols and prospective, controlled trials are needed to determine the value of integrating biomarkers into clinical decision making for bladder cancer detection and screening in the future.","in this review, we aimed to summarize the current knowledge on commercially available and promising investigational urine markers for the detection and surveillance of bladder cancer.  urinary biomarkers are promising as simple alternatives to cystoscopy for the diagnosis of recurrent bladder cancer.  potential biochemical markers excreted in the urine of bladder cancer patients have been considered, with the conclusion that none alone has yet proven to be useful as a screening procedure for the detection of urothelial cancer.  numerous molecular urine markers for the diagnosis of bladder cancer have been developed and evaluated mostly in case-control settings through the past decades.  many molecular assays for bladder cancer diagnosis and surveillance have been developed over the past several decades.  current methods in the noninvasive detection and surveillance of bladder cancer via urine analysis include voided urine cytology (vuc) and some diagnostic urinary protein biomarkers; however, due to the poor sensitivity of vuc and high false-positive rates of currently available protein assays, detection of bladder cancer via urinalysis remains a challenge.  many tumor markers for bladder cancer have been evaluated for use in detecting and monitoring bladder cancers tissue specimens, bladder washes, and urine specimens.  in the present study, comparative urine metabolomics selected putative metabolite markers for the detection of early-stage bladder cancer.  there are very few biomarkers used to diagnose bladder cancer and no clinically approved biomarkers for prediction or prognostication of this disease.  several urine markers have been and are currently being investigated for the diagnosis and prognostication of bladder malignancies.  our goal is to find non-invasive marker candidates that may help us gain insight into the metabolism of early-stage bladder cancer and be examined in routine health checks.  the ability to detect and monitor bladder cancer in noninvasively obtained urine samples is a major goal.  urine markers have been extensively studied to help improve the diagnosis of bladder cancer with the goal of complementing or even replacing cystoscopy.  pubmed/medline search was conducted to identify original articles, review articles, and editorials regarding urine-based biomarkers for screening, early detection, and surveillance of urothelial carcinoma of the bladder.  the appropriate use of these approaches has the potential to provide efficient biomarkers for the early detection and monitoring of recurrent bladder cancer.  the aim of this retrospective longitudinal analysis was to investigate if a molecular marker might be able to replace cystoscopy as a primary examination in diagnosis and follow-up of patients with pta grade 1-2 bladder cancer.  markers for aberrant methylation may be a potential gateway for monitoring bladder cancer.  bladder cancer detection and surveillance includes cystoscopy and cytology.  this longitudinal study suggests a potential of molecular urine tests in replacing cystoscopy in the follow-up of patients with pta g1-2 bladder cancer.  well-designed protocols and prospective, controlled trials are needed to provide the basis to determine whether integration of biomarkers into clinical decision making will be of value for bladder cancer detection and screening in the future. ||| ",Yes
Has proteomics been used in the study of the dry eye syndrome?,Yes,"Proteomics has indeed been employed in the study of dry eye syndrome, as evidenced by the use of two-dimensional nano-liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics to examine and compare the tear film proteome of type 2 diabetic patients with or without dry eye syndrome and normal subjects. This study aimed to investigate the tear proteome of dry eye syndrome patients using MS-based proteomic strategies. The findings could potentially lead to the identification of novel pathways for therapeutic targeting and new diagnostic markers. Discriminant analysis demonstrated highly significant changes in the protein profiles in patients with dry eye (p < 0.001). Furthermore, the discovery proteomics strategy was employed to identify a large number of significantly differentially expressed tear proteins in dry eye patients. Therefore, it can be concluded that proteomics has been utilized in the study of dry eye syndrome.","we sought to examine and compare the tear film proteome of type 2 diabetic patients with or without dry eye syndrome and normal subjects using two-dimensional nano-liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (ms)-based proteomics.  therefore, this study endeavoured to investigate in-depth the tear proteome of des patients employing the mass spectrometry (ms)-based proteomic strategies.  thus, it may become a very useful tool in the search for potential biomarkers for diagnosis and new therapeutics in ocular diseases such as dry eye.  dry eye syndrome in diabetic patients is associated with aberrant expression of tear proteins, and the findings could lead to identification of novel pathways for therapeutic targeting and new diagnostic markers.  discriminant analysis demonstrated highly significant changes in the protein profiles in patients with dry eye (p < 0.001).  protein and peptides in tears play an important role in ocular surface diseases.  in previous studies, changes have been demonstrated in the electrophoretic protein profiles of patients with dry eye.  twenty-one patients with dry eye (10 nsde and 11 psde) and 20 healthy volunteers were studied.  the identification of biomarkers revealed an increase of inflammatory markers in patients with dry eye and a decrease of some proteins that may have protective functions.  the purpose of this work was to determine the usefulness of surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (seldi-tof-ms) proteinchip array (ciphergen biosystems, inc., fremont, ca) technology for the automated analysis of proteins and peptides in tear fluid.  history of dry eye symptoms was taken and the symptoms were graded.  dry eye syndrome (des) is a common eye disease caused by tear deficiency or excessive tear evaporation.  tmt-based proteomics and wgcna are used to identify the differentially expressed proteins in tear proteome of type 2 diabetes with de.  discovery proteomics strategy was employed to identify large number of significantly differentially expressed tear proteins in drylip vs. ctrl, dryaq vs. ctrl and dryaqlip vs. ctrl with 22, 58 and 67 proteins, respectively.  dry eye syndrome (des) is a complex, multifactorial, immune-associated disorder of the tear and ocular surface.  there is no gold standard/standard test for diagnosing dry eye.  to understand the pathophysiology of dry eye disease (ded), it is necessary to characterize proteins in the ocular surface fluids, including tear fluid (tf) and lacrimal fluid (lf).  so, prt can be considered equally good in detecting dry eye.  dry eye syndrome is a collection of common disorders of multifactorial etiology.  dry eye is one of the most important features of this syndrome, and a recent study reported reduced deoxyribonuclease i (dnase i) activity in the tear of patients with dry eye. ||| ",Yes
Is PER3 required for CHK2 activation in human cells?,No,"The context provided does not mention PER3 in relation to CHK2 activation. Instead, it discusses the mechanisms of catalytic activation of pctk3 by cyclin a2 and pka, and the role of chk in signaling mediated by trka receptors. The degradation of chk2 is stated to be independent of its activation and kinase activity, as well as the phosphorylation in s456. Therefore, based on the given context, it cannot be concluded that PER3 is required for CHK2 activation in human cells.","in vitro and in vivo kinase assays showed that pctk3 was phosphorylated by pka at ser(12), ser(66), and ser(109) and that pctk3 activity significantly increased via phosphorylation at ser(12) by pka even in the absence of cyclin a2.  the results of the present study identify a novel regulatory mechanism of erk3 that operates in a cell-cycle-dependent manner.  here we describe the mechanisms of catalytic activation of pctk3 by cyclin a2 and camp-dependent protein kinase (pka).  taken together, our results provide the first evidence for the mechanisms of catalytic activation of pctk3 by cyclin a2 and pka and a physiological function of pctk3.  phosphoinositide 3-kinase (pi3k) participates in extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (erk1-2) activation according to signal strength, through unknown mechanisms.  our results suggest that nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of erk3 is required for its negative regulatory effect on cell cycle progression.  in the presence of cyclin a2, pctk3 activity was comparable to cdk2 activity.  using pc12 cells as a model system of neuronal cells, we show that chk participates in signaling mediated by trka receptors.  chk2 degradation is independent of both its activation and its kinase activity, but also of the phosphorylation in s456.  erk3 (extracellular-signal-regulated kinase 3) is an atypical mapk (mitogen-activated protein kinase) that is suggested to play a role in cell-cycle progression and cellular differentiation.  the aim of our study was to explore whether cr2 can independently mediate the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (mapks, including erk, jnk, and p38mapk), and to highlight the molecular mechanism of cd4+ cell deletion in aids.  chk was found to be associated with tyrosine-phosphorylated trka receptors in pc12 cells upon stimulation with ngf.  we find that chpks can target key regulators of transcription and replication.  thus, chk is a novel signaling molecule that participates in trka signaling, associates directly with trka receptors upon ngf stimulation, and is involved in neurite outgrowth of pc12 cells in response to ngf.  our data identify the first physiological protein substrate for erk3 and suggest a functional link between these kinases in which mk5 is a downstream target of erk3, while mk5 acts as a chaperone for erk3.  pkk may be phosphorylated by two specific mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinases, mekk2 and mekk3, and this interaction may in part be mediated through a critical activation loop residue, thr184.  an in vitro kinase assay using retinoblastoma protein as the substrate showed that pctk3 was specifically activated by cyclin a2 but not by cyclin e1, although its activity was lower than that of cdk2.  amino acid sequence analysis revealed that pctk3 contained four putative pka phosphorylation sites.  the present work aimed at investigating erk3 distribution during cell cycle and apoptosis in human tumor hela cells.  activation and blocking tests of mapks (erk, jnk, and p38mapk) were carried out in hos-cr2, hos-cd4, and hos-cd4cr2 cells. ||| ",Yes
Is imatinib an antidepressant drug?,No,"Imatinib is not an antidepressant drug. It is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor used to treat certain types of cancer, such as chronic myeloid leukemia and gastrointestinal stromal tumors. The context provided mentions imatinib in relation to its stimulation of irs-1(tyr612), akt(ser473), and akt(thr308) phosphorylation, but it does not classify it as an antidepressant. The context focuses on imipramine, a tricyclic antidepressant, and other antidepressant drugs such as milnacipran and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Therefore, it can be concluded that imatinib is not an antidepressant drug.","imipramine, an fda-approved tricyclic antidepressant, has been commonly used to relieve depressive symptoms in the clinic.  imipramine (imi) is a tricyclic synthetic antidepressant that is used to treat chronic psychiatric disorders, including depression and neuropathic pain.  imipramine is a tricyclic medication that has been used for the treatment of depression and other mood disorders.  milnacipran, a dual serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (snri), is one of the antidepressant drugs that clinicians use for routine depression care.  major depression is accompanied by an activation of the inflammatory response system (irs) and antidepressants may have immunoregulatory activities.  imatinib, but not sunitinib, also stimulated irs-1(tyr612), akt(ser473) and akt(thr308) phosphorylation.  selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are frequently used antidepressants.  overall, our study explored the negative correlation between the use of antidepressants and prostate cancer progression, showing that imi attenuated cell viability, migration, and invasion of pc-3 cells by suppressing the expression of akt and nf-κb-related signaling proteins and secretion of tumor necrosis factor-α (tnf-α), interleukin-1β (il-1β), and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (mcp-1).  although pharmacological and psychological interventions are both effective for major depression, antidepressant drugs are frequently used as first-line treatment in primary and secondary care settings.  although imipramine is thought to prevent the reuptake of synaptic serotonin and norepinephrine, its antidepressant-like mechanisms remain elusive.  major depressive disorder is a debilitating illness, which is most commonly treated with antidepressant drugs.  tricyclic antidepressants and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are the cornerstones of drug therapy.  the efficacy of antidepressants in irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) is controversial.  the relationship of plasma imipramine and desipramine to clinical improvement in this group of secondary depressions did not parallel previously reported relationships of these antidepressant molecules to clinical outcome in primary depressions.  anti-depressants have been reported to own anti-tumor potential types of cancers; however, the role of imipramine in non-small cell lung cancer (nsclc) has not been elucidated.  major depressive disorder (mdd) is a leading cause of disability worldwide, with a poorly known pathophysiology and sub-optimal treatment, based on serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-ht) reuptake inhibitors.  little additional anticholinergic impact of the imipramine was observable beyond that already attributable to the benztropine, and no significant relationships were found between a clinical measure of peripheral anticholinergic activity and either global clinical outcome or antidepressive efficacy.  interleukin (il)-2, a t-cell cytokine used to treat malignant melanoma, can induce profound depression.  the purpose of the present study is to compare the efficacy of imipramine in the treatment of psychotic versus nonpsychotic depression.  adjunctive imipramine has been found to be useful in the treatment of a substantial number of patients with syndromally defined post-psychotic depressions. ||| ",No
Does Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) have anti-inflammatory activity?,Yes,"Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) has been shown to exert potent anti-inflammatory effects, as evidenced by its ability to protect against atherosclerosis and other inflammatory diseases.

Additionally, ApoE has been implicated in modulating the central nervous system inflammatory response and has been shown to have neuroprotective effects. The anti-atherogenic properties of ApoE-associated lipoproteins have been partially attributed to its anti-inflammatory properties. Furthermore, ApoE has been shown to suppress inflammation and atherosclerosis by regulating cellular microRNA levels in leukocytes. These findings suggest that ApoE has a novel anti-atherogenic activity that is independent of its role in lipid metabolism.","apolipoprotein e (apoe) exerts potent antiinflammatory effects.  apolipoprotein e (apoe) exerts anti-inflammatory properties that protect against atherosclerosis and other inflammatory diseases.  apolipoprotein e (apoe) exerts prominent anti-inflammatory effects and undergoes recycling by target cells.  apolipoprotein e (apoe) has been detected to possess anti-inflammatory properties that can contribute to protection against experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (eae).  apolipoprotein e (apoe) has been implicated in modulating the central nervous system (cns) inflammatory response.  apolipoprotein e (apoe), well known to play a role in lipid transport and cholesterol metabolism, also exerts anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects in the central nervous system.  apolipoprotein e (apoe) has been shown to play a pivotal role in the development of cardiovascular disease, attributable to its function in lipid trafficking and immune modulating properties; however, its role in modulating inflammation in the setting of acute lung injury (ali) is unknown.  the apolipoprotein e (apo e) plays an important role in the lipoprotein metabolism and has been linked to inflammatory disease such as atherosclerosis and alzheimer disease.  the anti-atherogenic properties of human apoprotein e-associated lipoproteins have been partially attributed to its anti-inflammatory properties.  apolipoprotein e (apoe), an antiatherogenic apolipoprotein, plays a significant role in the metabolism of lipoproteins.  apolipoprotein e (apoe) exerts antiatherogenic effects but precise mechanisms remain unclear.  we show that apoe modulates the systemic type i inflammatory response in vivo.  previous data suggest that apoe also has antiinflammatory properties that may contribute to protection against atherosclerosis independent of its role in lipid metabolism.  apolipoprotein e (apoe) is synthesized in the liver and in macrophages, and it has antiatherogenic properties that are mediated, at least in part, through the regulation of plasma cholesterol homeostasis.  apolipoprotein e (apoe) mediates cellular cholesterol efflux and plays a crucial role in the inhibition of atherogenesis.  apolipoprotein (apo) e stands out among plasma apolipoproteins through its unprecedented ability to protect against atherosclerosis.  apolipoprotein e (apoe) is a 299 amino acid protein with multiple biological functions.  to test the hypothesis that apoe suppresses inflammation and atherosclerosis by regulating cellular microrna levels in these leukocytes.  this antiinflammatory effect represents a novel antiatherogenic activity of apoe.  we studied if endogenously expressed apoprotein e (apoe) elicits isoform-dependent effects on pro-inflammatory cytokine expression and secretion. ||| ",Yes
Can vitamin B1 deficiency cause encephalopathy?,Yes,"Vitamin B1, also known as thiamine, is an essential nutrient required for the proper functioning of the nervous system. A deficiency in thiamine can lead to a severe neurological disorder known as Wernicke's encephalopathy. This disorder is characterized by changes in consciousness, ocular abnormalities, and ataxia. The context provided also mentions that alteration of vitamin B12 metabolism can result in irreversible neurologic damage, and that vitamin B12 deficiency has a wide variety of neurological symptoms and signs. While the context does not explicitly state that vitamin B1 deficiency can cause encephalopathy, the fact that Wernicke's encephalopathy is a known complication of thiamine deficiency supports the claim that vitamin B1 deficiency can indeed cause encephalopathy.","vitamin b12 deficiency also leads to brain shrinkage and neurodegenerative disorders.  vitamin b12 deficiency leads to abnormal myelination or demyelination, resulting in sub-acute combined degeneration, peripheral neuropathy, and psychiatric problems, including delusions, hallucinations, cognitive changes, depression, and dementia.  neurologic complications associated with vitamin b12 deficiency include spinal cord degeneration, peripheral neuropathy and alteration of mental status.  vitamin b12 deficiency causes a number of neurological features including cognitive and psychiatric disturbances, gait instability, neuropathy, and autonomic dysfunction.  wernicke's encephalopathy (we) is a severe neurological disorder caused by a dietary deficiency of vitamin b1 and characterized by consciousness changes, ocular abnormalities, and ataxia.  in this study, it was determined that there was microstructural damage in the brain in the presence of vitamin b12 deficiency even in the asymptomatic period, and the patients revealed cognitive decline.  the purpose of this study was to show the cognitive effects in vitamin b12 deficiency cases that have not reached clinical symptom level using neuropsychological tests, and to show possible cerebral neuronal damage using diffusion tensor imaging (dti) method.  alteration of vitamin b12 metabolism can be genetic or acquired, and can result in anemia, failure to thrive, developmental regression and even irreversible neurologic damage.  wernicke encephalopathy--a debilitating acute or subacute neurological disorder-is caused by a deficiency in thiamine (vitamin b(1)).  can vitamin b12 and folate deficiency cause central retinal vein occlusion?  vitamin b12 deficiency is a common condition which can present with non-specific clinical features, and in severe cases with neurological or haematological abnormalities.  in developing countries, nutritional vitamin b12 deficiency in infants because of maternal deficiency often causes hematological and neurological disorders.  vitamin b12 deficiency leads to various symptoms such as neuropathy, growth retardation, and infertility.  low vitamin b₁₂ concentrations have been associated with higher risks of cognitive impairment, but whether these associations are causal is uncertain.  the biological basis for the observed neurological symptoms of infantile vitamin b12 deficiency remains uncertain.  optic neuropathy is a rare but recognised complication of vitamin b12 deficiency, which may proceed to visual failure if not diagnosed early enough.  vitamin b(12) deficiency (b(12)d) has a wide variety of neurological symptoms and signs.  vitamin b12 (cobalamin) deficiency is a common cause of macrocytic anemia and has been implicated in a spectrum of neuropsychiatric disorders.  however, epilepsy is a rare manifestation of vitamin b12 deficiency.  the possibility of vitamin b12 deficiency must be considered in all patients with these nervous system disorders, even in those who do not have anemia. ||| ",Yes
Do selenoproteins and selenium play a role in prostate cancer prevention?,Yes,"Epidemiological and clinical data suggest that selenium may prevent prostate cancer. Selenium compounds have known chemopreventive effects on prostate cancer. The dietary trace element selenium has been proposed to be a potential chemopreventive agent for prostate cancer. Epidemiologic studies and secondary analyses of randomized trials supported the hypothesis that selenium and vitamin E lower prostate cancer risk. The role of selenium in prostate cancer risk remains controversial, but many epidemiologic studies suggest an inverse association with more aggressive disease. The results support a role of selenium and polymorphisms in selenoenzymes in prostate cancer etiology, which warrants confirmation in future studies.","daily supplementation with the essential trace mineral selenium significantly reduced prostate cancer risk in men in the nutritional prevention of cancer trial.  we evaluated the association between serum selenium status and prostate cancer risk in a population with relative low selenium concentrations considering effect modification by genetic variants in selenoprotein genes.  relationships among the genotype of selenoproteins implicated in increased cancer risk, selenium status, and race with prostate cancer were investigated.  increased dietary intake of selenium (se) has been suggested to lower prostate cancer mortality, but supplementation trials have produced conflicting results.  greater prediagnostic serum selenium concentrations were not associated with prostate cancer risk in this large cohort, although greater concentrations were associated with reduced prostate cancer risks in men who reported a high intake of vitamin e, in multivitamin users, and in smokers.  selenium status is inversely associated with the incidence of prostate cancer.  selenium compounds have known chemopreventive effects on prostate cancer.  the dietary trace element selenium has been proposed to be a potential chemopreventive agent for prostate cancer.  we examined associations between plasma selenium, genotypes, and risk of high-grade prostate cancer (gleason grade ≥8 or 7 with primary score ≥4; n = 111) using logistic regression, and risk of prostate cancer recurrence (61 events; 3.8 y median follow-up) using cox proportional hazards regression.  overall, serum selenium was not associated with prostate cancer risk (p for trend = 0.70); however, higher serum selenium was associated with lower risks in men reporting a high (more than the median: 28.0 iu/d) vitamin e intake  and in multivitamin users (or for highest compared with the lowest quartile of selenium: 0.61; 95% ci: 0.36, 1.04; p for trend = 0.06; p for interaction = 0.05).  epidemiological and clinical data suggest that selenium may prevent prostate cancer, but the biological effects of selenium on normal or malignant prostate cells are not well known.  the role of selenium in prostate cancer (pca) risk remains controversial, but many epidemiologic studies suggest an inverse association with more aggressive disease.  epidemiologic studies and secondary analyses of randomized trials supported the hypothesis that selenium and vitamin e lower prostate cancer risk.  the aims were to investigate the association between serum selenium and prostate cancer risk and to examine interactions with other antioxidants and tobacco use.  serum selenium level (s-se) has been associated with prostate cancer (prca) risk.  the aim of this work was to assess whether risk of prostate cancer is affected by genetic variants in genes coding for selenoproteins, either alone or in combination with se status.  furthermore, among smokers, high serum selenium concentrations were related to reduced prostate cancer risk (or for the highest compared with the lowest quartile of selenium: 0.65; 95% ci: 0.44, 0.97; p for trend = 0.09; p for interaction = 0.007).  our results support a role of selenium and polymorphisms in selenoenzymes in prostate cancer etiology, which warrants confirmation in future studies.  thus, we examined plasma selenium and selenium-related genes in relation to risk of high-grade prostate cancer and prostate cancer recurrence among men initially diagnosed with non-metastatic disease.  epidemiological studies and clinical trials show that selenium supplementation results in reduction of prostate cancer incidence; however, the form of selenium and mechanisms underlying protection remain largely unknown. ||| ",No

Therefore, it cannot be definitively stated that NXY-059 can be used for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke patients.","nxy-059 is ineffective for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke within 6 hours after the onset of symptoms.  nxy-059 was well tolerated in patients with an acute stroke at and above concentrations shown to be neuroprotective in an animal model when initiated 4 hours after onset of permanent focal ischemia.  nxy-059 within 6 hours of acute ischemic stroke significantly reduced disability.  the administration of nxy-059 within six hours after the onset of acute ischemic stroke significantly improved the primary outcome (reduced disability at 90 days), but it did not significantly improve other outcome measures, including neurologic functioning as measured by the nihss score.  in patients with acute stroke, nxy-059 is well tolerated at concentrations known to be associated with neuroprotection in animal models of transient cerebral ischemia; however, higher target concentrations appear necessary on the basis of animal models of permanent ischemia.  additional research is needed to confirm whether nxy-059 is beneficial in ischemic stroke.  nxy-059 was well tolerated in patients with an acute stroke.  any effect of nxy-059 on hemostasis may be important when treating stroke patients.  we enrolled 3306 patients with acute ischemic stroke in a randomized, double-blind trial to receive a 72-hour infusion of intravenous nxy-059 or placebo within 6 hours after the onset of stroke symptoms.  nxy-059 is a free radical-trapping neuroprotectant developed for use in acute ischemic stroke.  we conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial involving 1722 patients with acute ischemic stroke who were randomly assigned to receive a 72-hour infusion of placebo or intravenous nxy-059 within 6 hours after the onset of the stroke.  the chosen dosing strategy of nxy-059 provides an easily adapted treatment regimen for acute stroke, resulting in early achievement of target plasma concentrations.  acute ischemic stroke patients receiving nxy-059 may also be exposed to diuretics for treatment of heart failure or hypertension.  we randomized 1722 patients with acute ischemic stroke to a 72-hour infusion of placebo or intravenous nxy-059 within 6 hours of stroke onset.  nxy-059 is a nitrone-based, free-radical trapping agent being developed for the treatment of acute ischaemic stroke.  this was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, dose-escalation, multicenter study that evaluated safety, tolerability, and plasma concentrations of 2 nxy-059 dosing regimens within 24 hours of acute stroke.  nxy-059 (disufenton sodium, cerovive, a nitrone with neuroprotective and free radical trapping properties (in experimental stroke) is under development for the treatment of acute stroke.  nxy-059 has neuroprotective efficacy when given 5 hours after onset of transient focal ischemia in the rat.  nxy-059 is a free radical-trapping neuroprotectant demonstrated to reduce disability from ischemic stroke.  the saint i trial demonstrated that the neuroprotective agent nxy-059 improves the distribution of acute stroke patient outcomes on the modified rankin scale (mrs) of global disability. ||| ",No
Have mutations in the ZEB2 gene been found in any human syndrome?,Yes,"Over 180 distinct mutations in the ZEB2 gene have been reported, including nonsense and missense point mutations, deletions, and large chromosomal rearrangements. These mutations are associated with haploinsufficiency of the ZEB2 gene in chromosome 2q22.3. A partial duplication of the ZEB2 gene has been reported to result in Mowat-Wilson syndrome. This duplication was identified as a novel de novo 69-kb duplication containing exons 1 and 2 of the ZEB2 gene. These findings suggest that mutations in the ZEB2 gene have been found in human syndromes.","over 180 distinct mutations in zeb2 have been reported, including nonsense and missense point mutations, deletions, and large chromosomal rearrangements.  it is caused by haploinsufficiency of the zeb2 gene in chromosome 2q22.3.  more recently, de novo mutations of zbtb18 have been identified in patients with syndromic and non-syndromic intellectual disability.  this is the first report of a partial duplication of the zeb2 gene resulting in mowat-wilson syndrome.  chromosomal microarray identified a novel de novo 69-kb duplication containing exons 1 and 2 of the zeb2 gene.  here we collect and summarize all available mutations in the human zic2 gene detected in hpe patients (21 published and 62 novel).  moreover, we hypothesize that nonsense mutations of zbtb18 are associated with a more severe phenotype than missense mutations.  genetic variation of the multi-zinc finger btb domain transcription factor zbtb18 can cause a spectrum of human neurodevelopmental disorders, but the underlying mechanisms are not well understood.  our results demonstrate that general population variants, while rare, can influence zbtb18 function, with potential consequences for neurodevelopment, homeostasis, and disease.  recently, we reported that pathogenic, de novo zbtb18 missense mutations alter its dna-binding specificity and gene regulatory functions, leading to human neurodevelopmental disease.  a total of 157 individuals from 119 unrelated kindreds are described, including 141 patients with intragenic sequence determined mutations in zic2.  by direct sequencing of dna samples of an unselected group of unrelated patients with hpe in our nih laboratory, zic2 mutations were found in 8.4% (49/582) of probands.  we report on a patient with a de novo zbtb18 nonsense mutation and a de novo 15q13.3 microdeletion, both in a heterozygous state, identified by next generation sequencing and array-cgh.  to characterise genetic and clinical findings in patients with zic2 mutations.  here, we investigated such variants documented in the genome aggregation database (gnomad) to discover that zbtb gene family members are intolerant to loss-of-function and missense mutations, but not synonymous mutations.  a homozygous frameshift mutation (c.231_232del) in zswim7 was found in two out of the 60 unrelated noa patients.  recent studies have shown that zbed3 is associated with insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus.  all zbtb24 mutations reported in icf patients are predicted to disrupt at least one zf motif.  zbtb18 has been proposed as candidate gene for microcephaly and abnormalities of the corpus callosum based on overlapping microdeletions of 1q43q44.  clinical details were examined and all other known cases of mutations in zic2 were included through a literature search. ||| ",Yes
Is Downs syndrome associated with decreased risk of leukemia?,No,"Down syndrome is associated with an increased risk of developing acute leukemia, specifically acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Patients with Down syndrome and standard risk ALL-DS have been reported to have inferior event-free and overall survival compared to patients without Down syndrome (ALL-NDS). The genetic disorder is not linked to a decreased risk of leukemia, but rather an increased risk. However, it is important to note that individuals with Down syndrome have a decreased risk for solid tumors, including brain tumors and lung cancers, which may be related to the gene-dosage effect of the extra chromosome 21.","down's syndrome is relatively common, and patients who are affected have an increased risk of developing acute leukemia, but not solid tumors.  children with down's syndrome (ds) have an increased risk of developing acute lymphoblastic leukemia (all) and have a low frequency of established genetic aberrations.  patients with down syndrome (ds) and standard risk (sr) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (all-ds) are reported to have inferior event free (efs) and overall survival (os) compared to patients without ds (all-nds).  the low risk of lung cancer in individuals with down syndrome may be related to the gene-dosage effect of the extra chromosome 21.  there is epidemiologic evidence that individuals with down syndrome are at decreased risk for solid tumors including brain tumors.  the genetic disorder down syndrome is associated with a decreased susceptibility for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.  hematological and immune abnormalities occur frequently in down syndrome patients.  solid tumors have a markedly decreased incidence in individuals with down syndrome (ds), including lung cancers.  in down syndrome, the incidence of solid tumors including lung cancer is considerably lower than that of the general population.  this supports the hypothesis that some genes whose expression is increased on the extra copy of chromosome 21 function as tumor suppressor genes and that they contribute to the reduced tumor incidence in individuals with down syndrome.  the incidence of solid tumors is low in individuals with down syndrome (trisomy 21), suggesting the presence of one or more tumor suppressor genes on chromosome 21.  we evaluated, in a preclinical setting, the impact of a down syndrome-like hematological/immune phenotype on atherosclerosis susceptibility.  studies performed in larger patient populations have shown that solid tumors, including lymphomas, are significantly less frequent in down patients than in children and adults who are not trisomy 21-affected.testicular lymphomas are rare and extremely aggressive.  in conclusion, we have shown that providing mice with a down syndrome-like hematological profile does not change the susceptibility to atherosclerosis.  in shwachman-diamond syndrome (sds), deletion of the long arm of chromosome 20, del(20)(q), often acquired in bone marrow (bm), may imply a lower risk of developing myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukaemia (mds/aml), due to the loss of the eif6 gene.  in individuals with ds, the risk of lung cancer appears markedly lower.  the findings are consistent with a role for an additional copy of btg3 in the reduced incidence of breast cancer in individuals with down syndrome.  down syndrome comprises multiple malformations and is due to trisomy of chromosome 21.  deletion of the chromosome 21 allele may be associated with tumorigenesis of meningioma in down syndrome.  increased cancer mortality risks associated with low plasma cholesterol were not explained by the confounding effect of antioxidant vitamins, but were attributed in part to the effect of preexisting cancer. ||| ",No
Is there a link between nuclear position and DNA repair pathway choice?,Yes,"The results indicate a link between nuclear position and DNA repair pathway choice. The study reveals that the nuclear position influences the choice of DNA repair pathway, with the spatial organization of DNA within the nucleus playing a regulatory role in double-strand break (DSB) repair. The emerging theme is that relocation to the nuclear pore complex (NPC) regulates recombination, influencing repair pathway choice, and providing a rescue mechanism for lesions or DNA structures resistant to repair. The results also suggest that damaged DNA exhibits increased random mobility within nuclear space, promoting DNA repair by facilitating homology search or releasing damage from repair-repressive locations. The nuclear pore appears crucial for DNA repair of persistent double-strand breaks, eroded telomeres, and sites of fork collapse at expanded CAG repeats. The study also highlights the role of nuclear architecture and chromatin state in DNA-dependent transactions, including the ability of cells to sense DNA lesions and restore damaged DNA.","our results are consistent with a model in which nuclear position dictates the choice of dna repair pathway, thus revealing a new level of regulation in dsb repair controlled by spatial organization of dna within the nucleus.  nuclear organization has emerged as a key parameter in the formation of chromosomal translocations, yet little is known as to whether dna repair can efficiently occur throughout the nucleus and whether it is affected by the location of the lesion.  to test this hypothesis, we have examined the nuclear distribution of sites of dna repair induced by oxidation or uv-c. we do not detect more damage (repair) at the nuclear periphery than in the nuclear interior.  the emerging theme is that relocation to the npc regulates recombination to influence repair pathway choice and provide a rescue mechanism for lesions or dna structures that are resistant to repair.  in this study we addressed the questions as to whether repair is confined to the nuclear matrix compartment, analogous to replication and transcription and how repair events are distributed in dna loops associated with the nuclear matrix.  despite this ordered spatial genome organization, damaged dna exhibits increased random mobility within nuclear space.  pulse labelling of ultraviolet (254 nm) irradiated confluent human fibroblasts revealed that repair was preferentially located in nuclear matrix associated dna in cells exposed to 5 j/m2.  this increased random movement is thought to promote dna repair by facilitating homology search, allowing targeting to repair-conducive nuclear domains, or releasing damage from repair-repressive locations.  of these two sites, the nuclear pore appears to be crucial for dna repair of persistent double-strand breaks, eroded telomeres and sites of fork collapse at expanded cag repeats.  nuclear architecture and the chromatin state affect most-if not all- dna-dependent transactions, including the ability of cells to sense dna lesions and restore damaged dna back to its native form.  the results of pulse-chase experiments exclude the possibility of transient binding of repair sites to the matrix and favour the model of preferential repair of dna sequences permanently associated with the nuclear matrix.  in this study the role of nuclear architecture in nucleotide excision repair (ner) was investigated by gentle dismantling of the cell and probing the capability of chromatin to carry out repair in vitro.  recent studies focusing on the relationship between telomeres, dna repair processes, and nuclear organization have revealed that the disruption of motor proteins or microtubules, which typically mediate the directed motion of cargo, disrupts the random mobility of damaged dna.  nuclear organization has an important role in determining genome function; however, it is not clear how spatiotemporal organization of the genome relates to functionality.  over the last decade, studies have revealed that several types of persistent dna lesions relocate to either the nuclear pore complex (npc) or nuclear envelope (ne).  early screens in yeast for mutations exhibiting sensitivity to dna damage identified nuclear pore components, but their role in dna repair was not well understood.  we suggest that features of the chromatin structure, or base composition, of sequences in the nuclear centre make them more susceptible to damage.  it has been shown that the positioning of a majority of nucleosomes is primarily controlled by factors other than the intrinsic preference of the dna sequence.  which pathway is used depends on the balance between the tumor suppressors 53bp1 and brca1 and on the availability of an undamaged template dna for homology-directed repair.  rad6, an e2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, is a key node for determining different dna damage repair pathways, controlling both the error-prone and the error-free dna damage repair pathways through differential regulation of the ubiquitination of the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (pcna) protein. ||| ",Yes
Does magnesium sulfate improve outcomes of subarachnoid hemorrhage patients?,No,"The evidence regarding the use of magnesium sulfate in aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage patients is conflicting. While some studies suggest that magnesium sulfate infusion may improve clinical outcomes through a reduction in delayed ischemic neurological deficit and cerebral ischemic events, other studies do not support the prophylactic use of magnesium sulfate. A meta-analysis of current data suggests that magnesium sulfate infusion improves the outcome after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage, but a recent trial found that intravenous magnesium sulphate does not improve clinical outcome after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. Therefore, routine administration of magnesium cannot be recommended at this time.","pilot clinical trials using magnesium sulfate in patients with acute aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage have reported trends toward improvement in clinical outcomes.  experimental work suggests a neuroprotective role for magnesium sulfate in aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage.  we studied 22 aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage patients with or without magnesium sulfate infusion for 10-14 days.  a meta-analysis of current data suggests that magnesium sulfate infusion improves the outcome after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage through a reduction in delayed ischemic neurological deficit.  randomized, parallel group, controlled trials of magnesium sulfate in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage were included.  to examine whether the maintenance of elevated magnesium serum concentrations by intravenous administration of magnesium sulfate can reduce the occurrence of cerebral ischemic events after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage.  a systematic review was conducted to determine the evidence for the prophylactic use of magnesium sulfate in aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage.  here we present data to assess the clinical effectiveness of magnesium sulfate in the prevention of cerebral vasospasm in patients who have suffered from aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage.  these data support the hypothesis that magnesium influences hemorrhage severity in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage, potentially through a hemostatic mechanism.  preliminary evidence has suggested that magnesium sulfate infusion reduces delayed ischemic neurological deficit and improves clinical outcome after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage.  current evidence does not support the prophylactic use of magnesium sulfate in aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage.  we aim to investigate the cerebral hemodynamic effects of magnesium sulfate infusion in aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage patients.  magnesium sulfate (mgso4) may be useful in preventing neurological injury after subarachnoid haemorrhage (sah).  these data indicate that high-dose intravenous magnesium can reduce cerebral ischemic events after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage by attenuating vasospasm and increasing the ischemic tolerance during critical hypoperfusion.  we tested the hypothesis that admission serum magnesium levels are associated with extent of hemorrhage in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage.  despite the publication of several randomized controlled studies, there is still much debate on whether magnesium sulfate improves outcome in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage.  a total of 12 patients who had experienced aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage were randomized to magnesium sulfate infusion (n = 6) or placebo infusion (n = 6) for 14 days.  we did a trial to test whether magnesium therapy improves outcome after aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage.  intravenous magnesium sulphate does not improve clinical outcome after aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage, therefore routine administration of magnesium cannot be recommended.  a meta-analysis was conducted to assess the effectiveness and safety of intravenous magnesium therapy in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage (sah). ||| ",No
Is Kanzaki disease associated with deficiency in alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase?,Yes,"Kanzaki disease is indeed associated with a deficiency in alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase. This enzyme, also known as alpha-naga, is responsible for hydrolyzing galactosaminyl moieties. The deficiency of this enzyme leads to the accumulation of glycopeptides and oligosaccharides in the lysosomes, resulting in Kanzaki disease. This disease is a lysosomal storage disorder, characterized by a wide spectrum of clinical and pathological presentations, including early onset neuroaxonal dystrophy and late onset angiokeratoma corporis diffusum. The deficiency of alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase in Kanzaki disease has been confirmed through various assays and analyses, including tlc analyses, which have shown impaired glycolipid modification in cell extracts from patients.","kanzaki disease (omim#104170) is attributable to a deficiency in alpha-n-acetylgalactosaminidase (alpha-naga; e.c.3.2.1.49), which hydrolyzes galnacalpha1-o-ser/thr.  alpha-n-acetylgalactosaminidase (alpha-naga) deficiency (schindler/kanzaki disease) is a clinically and pathologically heterogeneous genetic disease with a wide spectrum including an early onset neuroaxonal dystrophy (schindler disease) and late onset angiokeratoma corporis diffusum (kanzaki disease).  these data suggest that a prototype of alpha-naga deficiency in kanzaki disease and factors other than the defect of alpha-naga may contribute to severe neurological disorders, and kanzaki disease is thought to be caused by a single enzyme deficiency.  assays of each of these substrates with fibroblast homogenates of the patients demonstrated the profound deficiency of alpha-n-acetylgalactosaminidase activity compared with controls.  alpha-n-acetylgalactosaminidase deficiency in intact cells was confirmed by tlc analyses, which showed impaired glycolipid modification in cell extracts obtained following addition of forssman gsl and c6-nbd-lyso-forssman gl to the culture media of fibroblasts from the patients.  alpha-n-acetylgalactosaminidase (2-acetamido-2-deoxy-alpha-d-galactoside acetamidodeoxy-galactohydrolase, naga; ec 3.2.1.49) deficiency is a recently recognized autosomal recessive lysosomal disease.  alpha-n-acetylgalactosaminidase (alpha-naga) deficiency is a rare hereditary lysosomal storage disease, and only three alpha-naga-deficient patients with angiokeratoma corporis diffusum (kanzaki) have been described.  human alpha-n-acetylgalactosaminidase (alpha-galnac, e.c.  alpha-n-acetylgalactosaminidase (alpha-naga) deficiency with angiokeratoma corporis diffusum (akcd) is one of the lysosomal storage diseases.  this neurologic disease results from a defect in the lysosomal α-n-acetylgalactosaminidase (α-nagal) enzyme.  deficient activity of lysosomal alpha-n-acetylgalactosaminidase represents a recently recognized lysosomal disorder whose neurologic manifestation in infancy is infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy.  the inherited human disorders sialidosis and galactosialidosis are the result of deficiencies of glycoprotein-specific alpha-neuraminidase (acylneuraminyl hydrolase, ec 3.2.1.18; sialidase) activity.  the deficient activity of this enzyme results in schindler disease, an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by the increased urinary excretion of glycopeptides and oligosaccharides containing alpha-n-acetylgalactosaminyl moieties.  kanzaki disease has the same enzyme defect as schindler disease, but the manifestations are quite different.  immunocytochemical analysis revealed that the main lysosomal accumulated material in cultured fibroblasts from patients with kanzaki disease is tn-antigen.  angiokeratoma corporis diffusum with glycopeptiduria is a recently recognized inborn error of glycoprotein catabolism resulting from the deficient activity of human alpha-n-acetylgalactosaminidase (e.c.  schindler disease is a lysosomal storage disorder caused due to deficiency or defective activity of alpha-n-acetylgalactosaminidase (α-naga).  inherited deficiency of sialidase results in sialidosis or galactosialidosis, both severe metabolic disorders associated with lysosomal storage of oligosaccharides and glycopeptides.  schindler disease is a recently recognized infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy resulting from the deficient activity of the lysosomal hydrolase, alpha-n-acetylgalctosaminidase (alpha-galnac).  schindler/kanzaki disease is an inherited metabolic disease with no current treatment options. ||| ",Yes
Is there any software for automated analysis of immuno-histochemistry images?,Yes,"The context indicates that there are several commercially available software packages that allow image analysis, including those specifically designed for immunohistochemistry.

The context also mentions the development of a flexible color image analyzer (microcomputer-assisted picture processing system type ii, mapps-ii) for the analysis of immunostained colorectal neoplasms. The increasing demand for immunohistochemistry for clinical diagnostics and the ongoing shortage of staff in histology laboratories have brought about a need for automation in immunohistochemistry. Therefore, it is suitable for the fast and efficient analysis of high numbers of fully digitalized histologic sections, potentially allowing ""high-throughput"" quantitative ""histomic"" analysis.","automation in histopathology is an attractive concept and recent advances in the application of computerized expert systems and machine vision have made automated image analysis of histological images possible.  computerized image analysis for whole-slide images has been shown to improve efficiency, accuracy, and consistency in histopathology evaluations.  using software for high-throughput cell image analysis offers researchers the possibility of performing comprehensive and precise analysis of a high number of images in an automated manner, making this routine task easier.  to minimize critical aspects of manual quantitative data acquisition, we generated semi-automated image-processing steps for the quantification of individual stained cells with immunohistochemical staining of different subcellular location.  systems capable of complete automation not only require the ability to segment tissue features and grade histological abnormalities, but, must also be capable of locating diagnostically useful areas from within complex histological scenes.  recent technological advances like highly efficient automated whole slide digitizer (scanner) systems, innovative ia platforms, and the emergence of pathologist-friendly image annotation and analysis systems mean that quantification of features on histological digital images will become increasingly prominent in pathologists' daily professional lives.  increasingly automated techniques for arraying, immunostaining, and imaging tissue sections led us to design software for convenient management, display, and scoring.  the identification of diagnostically useful fields advances the potential of automated systems in histopathology: these regions could than be scrutinized at high power using knowledge-guided image segmentation for disease grading.  the aim of this study was to test and validate the underlying image analysis algorithm with respect to user friendliness, accuracy, and transferability to different histologic scenarios.  in order to evaluate the correlation between immunohistochemical and morphometric data on the same histological sections, we have developed a flexible color image analyzer (microcomputer-assisted picture processing system type ii, mapps-ii), and established an effective method to analyze the immunostained colorectal neoplasms based on the color recognition theory of human visual system.  there are several commercially available software packages that allow image analysis; however, these can be complex, require relatively high level of computer skills, and can be expensive.  one solution would be software that works on a user's laptop or workstation that can access all image settings and provide quick and easy-to-use analysis of data.  the increasing demand for immunohistochemistry for clinical diagnostics, in combination with an ongoing shortage of staff in the histology laboratory, has brought about a need for automation in immunohistochemistry.  therefore, it is suitable for the fast and efficient analysis of high numbers of fully digitalized histologic sections, potentially allowing ""high-throughput"" quantitative ""histomic"" analysis.  digital pathology enables computational analysis algorithms to be applied at scale to histological images.  to review how technology has been applied to automating the process of immunohistochemical staining.  digital immunohistochemistry (ihc) is one of the most promising applications brought by new generation image analysis (ia).  embedded in reliable automated systems, ia could help pathologists in their daily work and thus contribute to more accurate determination of prognostic histological factors on whole slide images.  quantitative analysis of histologic slides is of importance for pathology and also to address surgical questions.  we reviewed strategies for acquiring, collating, and storing histological images with the goal of streamlining subsequent data analyses. ||| ",Yes
Is there any link between the aurora B kinase and the polycomb protein ring1B?,No,"The context provided does not establish a direct link between the aurora B kinase (aurkb) and the polycomb protein ring1B. The text primarily discusses the roles and interactions of ring1B within the polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1), its function in histone H2A ubiquitination, and its association with other proteins such as rybp and bmi1. The text also mentions the role of aurkb in the regulation of mitosis and its potential as a therapeutic target in cancers, particularly retinoblastoma. However, no explicit connection is made between aurkb and ring1B, and their functions are described separately. Therefore, based on the given context, it cannot be concluded that there is a direct link between aurkb and ring1B.","the ring1b is a core subunit protein of the prc1 (polycomb repressive complex 1), which plays key roles in the regulation of the homeobox gene expression, x-chromosome inactivation, stem cell self-renewal, and tumorigenesis.  ring1 and yy1 binding protein (rybp), a new member of the polycomb group protein family, has been reported to play an important role in various biological processes.  polycomb group proteins ring1b and bmi1 (b-cell-specific moloney murine leukaemia virus integration site 1) are critical components of the chromatin modulating prc1 complex.  aurora kinase b (aurkb) plays a pivotal role in the regulation of mitosis and is gaining prominence as a therapeutic target in cancers; however, the role of aurkb in retinoblastoma (rb) has not been studied.  histone h2a ubiquitination by the prc1 complex strongly depends on the ring1b protein.  to study the function of kyot, yeast two-hybrid was performed and proteins interacting with kyot2 including ring1 and hpc2 (human polycomb 2) that belong to pcg(polycomb group) were analyzed.  these data provide a foundation for understanding the critical enzymatic activity at the core of the prc1 polycomb complex, which is implicated in stem cell maintenance and cancer.  the rybp protein has been promoted as a polycomb group (pcg)-associated protein, but its molecular function has remained elusive.  the rybp interacting pcg protein ring1b, a known ubiquitin e3 ligase, promotes rybp ubiquitination.  we solved the crystal structure of the ring-ring heterodimeric complex of ring1b and bmi1.  here we show that the e3-ligase activity of ring1b on histone h2a is enhanced by bmi1 in vitro.  all four e2s promote autoubiquitination of ring1b without affecting e3-ligase activity.  moreover, one target of rybp's ubiquitin binding domain appears to be ubiquitinated histone h2a; this histone is a substrate for ring1b's e3 ligase activity in association with gene silencing processes.  the n-terminal ring-domains are sufficient for this activity and ring1a can replace ring1b.  the c-terminal region of ring1b interacts with rybp, a transcriptional repressor in transiently transfected cells, and also with m33, another transcriptional repressor involved in mesoderm patterning.  interactions of kyot2 with ring1 and hpc2 suggested that pcg family might be involved in notch signaling pathway.  in the structure the arrangement of the ring-domains is similar to another h2a e3 ligase, the brca1/bard1 complex, but complex formation depends on an n-terminal arm of ring1b that embraces the bmi1 ring-domain.  previous studies have proposed that cbl is also a positive regulator of crkl-c3g signalling, which leads to rap1 activation.  aurkb is overexpressed in rb, and targeting it could serve as a novel therapeutic strategy to restrict tumor cell growth.  here, we show that cbl deficiency results in enhanced activation of rap1. ||| ",Yes
Is metabolic syndrome related with cardiovascular disease?,Yes,"Justification: The metabolic syndrome, characterized by a cluster of risk factors including disturbed glucose and insulin metabolism, obesity, abdominal fat distribution, dyslipidemia, and hypertension, is positively correlated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease.

It is also associated with an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease, as well as increased mortality from cardiovascular disease.","the metabolic syndrome, a clustering of disturbed glucose and insulin metabolism, obesity and abdominal fat distribution, dyslipidemia, and hypertension is associated with cardiovascular diseases.  the metabolic syndrome is associated with increased cardiovascular risk.  the metabolic syndrome (mets) is believed to be associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (cvd).  the metabolic syndrome, a concurrence of disturbed glucose and insulin metabolism, overweight and abdominal fat distribution, mild dyslipidemia, and hypertension, is associated with subsequent development of type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease (cvd).  the metabolic syndrome is a cluster of cardiovascular risk factors, including abdominal obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia and insulin resistance, associated with increased risk of cardiovascular diseases and all cause mortality.  metabolic syndrome, indicated by insulin resistance/hyperinsulinemia, obesity, central obesity, atherogenic dyslipidemia, and hypertension, contributes to atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.  metabolic syndrome refers to a constellation of risk factors for cardiovascular disease.  the subjects with metabolic syndrome are an increased risk for the development of diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease as well as an increased mortality for cardiovascular disease in all causes.  metabolic syndrome is associated with abdominal obesity, blood lipid disorders, inflammation, insulin resistance or full-blown diabetes, and increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease.  the presence of the metabolic syndrome has been positively correlated with the cardiovascular risk (or 1.29; 95% ci, 1.05-1.54, p=0.047).  the association of metabolic syndrome with coronary artery disease (cad) has been studied extensively.  the metabolic syndrome is associated with a high incidence of cardiovascular disease even when the abnormalities present in the syndrome are mild.  metabolic syndrome (mets) is proposed as a predictor for cardiovascular disease (cvd).  cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality are increased in men with the metabolic syndrome, even in the absence of baseline cvd and diabetes.  metabolic syndrome (coexisting visceral obesity, dyslipidemia, hyperglycemia, and hypertension) is a prominent risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, however, its effect on cardiac gene expression pattern is unclear.  metabolic syndrome is a cluster of risk factors leading to cardiometabolic diseases.  metabolic syndrome (metsyn) is an important risk factor for type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases (cvd).  a rapidly growing body of evidence demonstrates important associations between the metabolic syndrome, characterized by a cluster of risk factors or phenotypes that include dyslipidemia, central obesity, hypertension, and hyperinsulinemia, and both cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes.  the term metabolic syndrome or cardiometabolic syndrome describes the clustering of several cardiovascular and renal risk factors, including type 2 diabetes mellitus, central obesity, hypertension, and dyslipidemia.  the risk of developing cardiovascular disease has recently been associated with a set of metabolic and physiological risk factors that include abdominal obesity, atherogenic dyslipidemia, hypertension, and elevated plasma glucose. ||| ",Yes
Does low T3 negatively affect prognosis of patients after cardiac surgery?,Yes,"The evidence suggests that low T3 levels are associated with poor clinical outcomes in patients after cardiac surgery. Patients with low cardiac output syndrome after surgery had significantly lower T3 concentrations than patients without this complication. Low T3 levels were also found to be a strong predictor of death in cardiac patients and were associated with higher 30-day and 6-month mortality rates. The postoperative period after cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass is associated with a low T3 syndrome, which is a predictor of poor outcome in patients with cardiac dysfunction. Therefore, it can be concluded that low T3 levels negatively affect the prognosis of patients after cardiac surgery.","those patients with low cardiac output syndrome after surgery had significantly lower t3 concentrations than patients without this complication.  clinical and experimental data have suggested a potential negative impact of low-t3 state on the prognosis of cardiac diseases.  a correlation between low t3 and poor clinical outcomes in the intensive care unit is more established.  to evaluate the prevalence and predictive value of low t3 levels on 30-day and 6-month mortality in non-critically ill patients.  low-t3 syndrome is a strong predictor of death in cardiac patients and might be directly implicated in the poor prognosis of cardiac patients.  low t3 levels are a prevalent condition among non-critically ill patients, and this condition is associated with poor clinical outcomes in this population.  the postoperative period after cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (cpb) is associated with a low t3 syndrome, i.e.  low-t(3) syndrome is a predictor of poor outcome in patients with cardiac dysfunction.  the effect of the baseline free t3 (ft3) concentration and of preoperative low t3 syndrome (ft3 <2.23 pmol/l) on the risk of low cardiac output (co) and death was analyzed in a logistic regression model.  low t3 levels were associated with higher 30-day hospital mortality (15.1% vs 4.1%, p < 0.001) and higher 6-month overall mortality (31.7% vs 13.2%, p < 0.001).  low t3 is related to increased early and late mortality in nste-acs patients.  we studied low t3 level's relation to long-term mortality in non-st-elevation acute coronary syndrome (nste-acs) patients.  in conclusion, low t3 predicts worse hospital outcomes in patients with acute hf and can be useful in the risk stratification of these patients.  the aim of this study is to investigate the prognostic value of total t3 levels for major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (macces) in patients with ami undergone percutaneous coronary intervention (pci).  low triiodothyronine (t3) state is associated with poor prognosis in critical acute and prolonged illness.  although a low triiodothyronine (t3) state is closely associated with heart failure (hf), it is uncertain whether total t3 levels on admission is correlated with the clinical outcomes of acute myocardial infarction (ami).  low total t3 correlated with an increased length of stay in the hospital (median 11 vs 7 days, p <0.001) and increased need for invasive mechanical ventilation (9.8% vs 1.3%, p = 0.045).  in multivariate analysis, low t3 was found to be related to mortality at 1 year (or: 2.6, 95% ci: 1.1-6.5, p = 0.02).  in addition, we examined low t3 level's relation to early and long-term mortality.  our preliminary data suggest that the low t3 state is a predictor of outcome in pulmonary patients with respiratory failure. ||| ",Yes

Are alterations in ultraconserved elements associated with colorectal adenocarcinoma?,Yes,"The context does not provide explicit information on the association between alterations in ultraconserved elements and colorectal adenocarcinoma. The context primarily focuses on the role of genetic and epigenetic alterations, such as DNA methylation, miRNA alterations, and somatic copy number alterations, in the development and progression of colorectal cancer. However, it does not discuss ultraconserved elements, which are DNA sequences that are highly conserved across species and have been implicated in various cancers. Therefore, based on the provided context, it is unclear whether alterations in ultraconserved elements are associated with colorectal adenocarcinoma.","identification of the colorectal adenoma-carcinoma sequence with its corresponding genetic and epigenetic alterations has significantly increased our knowledge of the etiopathogenesis of colorectal cancer (crc).  the accumulation of genetic alterations of cancer-related genes is also essential for colorectal carcinogenesis.  our aims were to assess the role of epigenetic processes in tumour formation and to identify characteristic dna methylation and mirna alterations in the colorectal adenoma-carcinoma sequence.  identification of molecular alterations occurring in the adenomatous and carcinomatous components within the same tumor would greatly enhance understanding of the neoplastic progression of colorectal cancer.  our data support the presence of colorectal cancer-associated mirna alterations in screen-detected adenomas that may be useful for risk stratification for surveillance interval planning.  colorectal cancer (crc) arises from the normal colon epithelium through the accumulation of genetic mutations and epigenetic alterations that are associated with progression along the histological adenoma-adenocarcinoma sequence.  as most colorectal cancers (crc) develop from villous adenomas, studying alterations in gene expression profiles across the colorectal adenoma-dysplasia-carcinoma sequence may yield potential biomarkers of disease progression.  it is unclear whether somatic copy number alterations (scnas) contribute to the development of colorectal cancer (crc).  in 164 colorectal tumours (34 hyperplastic polyps, 38 tubular adenomas with low grade dysplasia (ta-l), 51 tubular adenomas with high grade dysplasia (ta-h), and 41 invasive carcinomas), epithelial and stromal genetic instability with national cancer institute standard microsatellite markers and chromosome 17 (chr17) markers, were analysed by a combination of laser capture microdissection and genescan approaches.  for two distinct subsets of the microsatellite unstable colorectal cancers, those with acquired methylation and braf mutation, and those without methylation suggestive of an underlying germ line mutation, the molecular changes in the majority of their synchronous benign tumors were different from the colorectal cancer.  the defined lncrna sets may have a regulatory role in the colorectal adenoma-carcinoma transition.  colorectal cancer (crc) is a major cause of cancer morbidity and mortality, and elucidation of its underlying genetics has advanced diagnostic screening, early detection, and treatment.  measurement of dna hypomethylation levels of colorectal adenomas by line-1 could have future implications in approaches to defining crc risk in screening programs.  colorectal cancer and adenoma adjacent to cancer exhibit distinct microrna (mirna) alterations in an apparent mucosa-to-adenocarcinoma sequence.  our results suggest that increased expression of defense genes is an early event in the progression of colorectal adenomas to carcinomas.  here, we aimed to identify the molecular profiles of early colorectal carcinogenesis based on scnas and determine the associations of other molecular abnormalities for the detection of neoplasia in both intramucosal neoplasia (imn) and invasive crc with invasion into the muscular layer without metastasis (early invasive crc).  line-1 hypomethylation of precancerous adenomas correlates with the presence of synchronous crc.  in addition, the incidence of genetic alterations in the colorectal adenomas that we examined appears to be independent of the tumour's dna index.  this upward shift in the frequency of proliferating cells in the crypt was significantly higher in the patients with colorectal adenoma and cancer than in the controls, and may be used to identify subjects at high risk for colorectal cancer.  thus microenvironmental changes due to genetic alteration in chr17 markers in stromal cells may play an important role in colon adenoma and adenocarcinoma development. ||| ",Yes
Is pregabalin effective for treatment of patients with restless leg syndrome?,Yes,"Pregabalin has been shown to be effective in the treatment of several clinical conditions associated with sleep disturbance, including neuropathic pain, fibromyalgia, and partial onset seizures. The data demonstrate that pregabalin has a positive benefit on sleep disturbance associated with these conditions. Although the context does not specifically mention restless leg syndrome, pregabalin's efficacy in treating other conditions associated with sleep disturbance suggests that it may also be effective in treating restless leg syndrome. Additionally, pregabalin is an anticonvulsant drug indicated for neuropathic disorders, and restless leg syndrome is considered a neuropathic disorder. Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that pregabalin may be effective in treating restless leg syndrome. However, further research is needed to confirm this.","this review summarizes the published data on the effects of pregabalin on sleep disturbance associated with neuropathic pain, fibromyalgia, restless legs syndrome, partial onset seizures and general anxiety disorder.  treatment with pregabalin results in rapid time to significant improvement in both pain and pain-related sleep interference in patients with neuropathic pain due to sci.  the data demonstrate that pregabalin has a positive benefit on sleep disturbance associated with several different clinical conditions.  the purpose of this study was to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of pregabalin in patients with leg symptoms due to lumbar spinal stenosis.  pregabalin is often used for the treatment of chronic pain syndromes.  in 2 large-scale, placebo-controlled trials, pregabalin improved both pain and pain-related sleep interference in patients with neuropathic pain due to spinal cord injury (sci).  pregabalin was also associated with significant improvements from baseline in pain-related sleep interference, and the medical outcomes study sleep scale sleep problems index and sleep disturbance subscale (all p < 0.001).  pregabalin is indicated for the treatment of fibromyalgia and pregabalin-treated subjects have shown improved pain, sleep and functional measures in placebo-controlled and open-label studies.  pregabalin is an anticonvulsant drug indicated for neuropathic disorders and fibromyalgia.  the anticonvulsant pregabalin is increasingly prescribed for pain, seizures, and psychiatric disorders.  pregabalin is effective in the treatment of peripheral and central neuropathic pain.  what is the role of pregabalin (lyrica) in the treatment of fibromyalgia?  pregabalin is a drug for neuropathic pain.  pregabalin is an anti-convulsant that successfully treats many neuropathic pain syndromes, although the mechanism of its anti-hyperalgesic action remains elusive.  pregabalin is a synthetic amino acid compound effective in clinical trials for the treatment of post-herpetic neuralgia, diabetic peripheral neuropathy, generalized anxiety disorder and adjunctive therapy for partial seizures of epilepsy.  flexible-dose pregabalin 150-600 mg/day was effective in relieving neuropathic pain, improving disturbed sleep, improving overall patient status, and was generally well tolerated in patients with post-traumatic peripheral neuropathic pain.  pregabalin is a well-accepted treatment option for patients with neuropathic pain.  the purpose of this study was to analyze the therapeutic efficacy of pregabalin for reducing the incidence of spinal surgery for leg symptoms in patients with lumbar spinal stenosis during the first year of treatment.  pregabalin is approved for the treatment of a variety of clinical conditions and its analgesic, anxiolytic and anticonvulsant properties are well documented.  however, the therapeutic efficacy of pregabalin for reducing the incidence of spinal surgery to treat leg symptoms in patients with lumbar spinal stenosis remains unknown. ||| ",Yes
Is Beta-Thalassemia is associated with a mutation or deletion of the gene that codes for alpha globin?,No,"Beta-Thalassemia is not associated with a mutation or deletion of the gene that codes for alpha globin. Instead, it is caused by mutations or deletions in the beta-globin gene, leading to reduced or absent synthesis of the beta chains of hemoglobin. This results in a relative excess of alpha-hemoglobin, causing anemia. The mutations in the beta-globin gene can be point mutations or, more rarely, deletions, and can result in reduced (β+) or absent (β0) synthesis of the beta chains. The context provided does not support the claim that Beta-Thalassemia is associated with mutations or deletions in the alpha-globin gene.","alpha-thalassemia (α-thal) is a disorder caused by the deletion of single or double α-globin genes, and/or point mutations in the α-globin genes.  unlike beta-thalassemia, in which non-deletional mutations predominate, most of recognized alpha-thalassemia mutations include deletion of one or both alpha-globin genes.  alpha thalassemia is a genetic disorder of hemoglobin production that typically is inherited in an autosomal co-dominant fashion.  alpha-thalassemia and beta-thalassemia, respectively.  thalassemias are a group of inherited autosomal recessive hematologic disorders that occur because of defects in the alpha (α)- and beta (β)-globin genes of adult hemoglobin (hb).  introduction: alpha- and beta-thalassemia are caused by reduced or absent synthesis of hemoglobin (hb) subunits α and/or β. hba2, hba1, and hbb mutations are the main cause of thalassemias.  thalassemia is a heritable human anemia caused by a variety of mutations that affect expression of the alpha- or the beta-chain of hemoglobin.  alpha and beta-thalassemia are the main two types observed in case of mutations affecting alpha and beta-globin genes respectively.  alpha-thalassaemia is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by defective production of the alpha chain of haemoglobin.  the beta-thalassemia is associated with abnormality in beta-globin gene, leading to imbalanced synthesis of alpha-/beta-globin chains.  alpha-thalassemia is the most common inherited disorder of hemoglobin (hb) synthesis in the world.  beta-thalassemia is an anemia caused by a relative excess of alpha-hemoglobin (alphahb) due to absent or reduced beta-hemoglobin (betahb) synthesis.  β-thalassemia (β-thal) is a common single gene autosomal recessive disorder resulting in severe anemia due to reduced or absent β-globin polypeptide synthesis.  the three patients homozygous for the alpha-globin gene locus (anti 3.7 kb arrangement) had beta(0)-thalassaemia mutations and a diagnosis of thalassaemia intermedia, preserving haemoglobin levels around 7-8 g/dl.  beta thalassemia is due to impaired production of beta globin chains, leading to a relative excess of alpha globin chains.  α-thalassemia, which is caused by defective synthesis of the hemoglobin α-globin chains, is the most commonly inherited recessive hemoglobin abnormality.  thalassemia is an inherited hematological disorder which can generally be classified according to the affected globin imbalance (alpha- or beta-globin) into two main types, i.e.  of the 17 beta-thalassaemia heterozygotes (six children and 11 adults), 16 had severe beta-thalassaemia mutations interacting with an additional alpha-globin gene (13 with alpha alpha alpha anti-3.7 and four with alpha alpha alpha anti-4.2).  it is caused mainly by point mutations or, more rarely, deletions on the β-globin gene, leading to reduced (β+) or absent (β0) synthesis of the β chains of hemoglobin (hb).  here we described a large deletional mutation of the β-globin gene cluster previously unreported in the chinese population, the 3.5 kb deletion (nc_000011.10: g.5224302-5227791del3490bp) removing the β-globin gene promoter and the whole β-globin gene leading to a β0-thal phenotype. ||| ",No
Is valproic acid effective for glioblastoma treatment?,Yes,"The evidence suggests that valproic acid (VPA) has been investigated for its anticancer properties in different tumors, including malignant gliomas and glioblastoma. VPA is an antiepileptic drug with histone deacetylase inhibitor activity, which has been shown to enhance overall survival and progression-free survival in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma. In some retrospective studies, VPA has been suggested to lead to a superior outcome in glioblastoma patients. VPA has also been found to have antitumor effects on gliomas, although its role has not been fully determined. Additionally, VPA has been shown to radiosensitize glioblastoma cells and sensitize them to radiation in preclinical models. Therefore, VPA may represent a novel therapeutic option for glioblastoma treatment.","valproic acid (vpa) has been recently investigated for its anticancer properties in different tumors, including malignant gliomas.  retrospective evidence suggests that valproic acid (vpa), an antiepileptic drug, is associated with improved outcomes in glioblastoma.  valproic acid (vpa) is an antiepileptic agent with histone deacetylase inhibitor activity shown to enhance overall survival and progression free survival in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma (gbm).  valproic acid (vpa) is a histone deacetylase inhibitor that apart from its anticonvulsive effects in some retrospective studies has been suggested to lead to a superior outcome of glioblastoma patients.  valproic acid (vpa), a widely used antiepileptic drug, has been found to have antitumor effects on gliomas, but its role still has not been determined.  valproic acid (va) is an antiepileptic drug (aed) and histone deacetylase (hdac) inhibitor taken by patients with glioblastoma (gb) to manage seizures, and it can modulate the biologic effects of radiation therapy (rt).  valproic acid (vpa) is an antiepileptic agent with hdaci (histone deacetylase inhibitor) activity shown to radiosensitize glioblastoma (gbm) cells.  valproic acid (vpa), an established antiepileptic drug, was assessed for antitumor activity, including its effects on glioblastoma, but its role has not been determined.  valproic acid (vpa), an anticonvulsant and mood-stabilizing drug is used to treat epileptic seizure of glioblastoma patients.  valproic acid (vpa) is an antiepileptic agent with histone deacetylase inhibitor (hdaci) activity shown to sensitize glioblastoma (gbm) cells to radiation in preclinical models.  to examine the efficacy of valproic acid (vpa) given either with or without levetiracetam (lev) on seizure control and on survival in patients with glioblastoma multiforme (gbm) treated with chemoradiation.  valproic acid (vpa), one of the most common histone deacetylase inhibitors (hdacis), has been detected to directly or synergistically exert inhibitory effects on glioma in vitro and in vivo.  the antiepileptic drug valproic acid (vpa) inhibits histone deacetylase in glioblastoma cells in vitro, which influences several oncogenic pathways and decreases glioma cell proliferation.  therefore, valproic acid may represent a novel therapeutic option in medulloblastoma treatment.  to evaluate the antitumor efficacy and mechanisms of action of valproic acid in medulloblastoma and supratentorial primitive neuroectodermal tumor (spnet), which are among the most common malignant brain tumors in children with poor prognosis, two medulloblastoma (daoy and d283-med) and one spnet (pfsk) cell lines were treated with valproic acid and evaluated with a panel of in vitro and in vivo assays.  valproic acid is frequently prescribed and used to treat epilepsy, bipolar disorder and other conditions.  similar concentrations of valproic acid added to neuro-2a, sk-n-sh and c6 cell lines as well as human ntera-2 astrocytes did not evoke cell death.  valproic acid (vpa) is an established drug in the long-term therapy of epilepsy.  the anti-epileptic drug valproic acid is also under trial as an anti-cancer agent due to its histone deacetylase (hdac) inhibitory properties.  valproic acid is widely used for the treatment of epilepsy and mood disorders, but its mode of action is unclear. ||| ",Yes
Is there increased recombination rate in human regulatory domains?,Yes,"Justification: The context suggests that there is an increased emphasis on homologous recombination in recent years, and this process is known to be involved in DNA repair and genomic rearrangements. The presence of recombination hotspots at imprinted regions, which are likely due to the presence of imprinted genes, further supports the notion of increased recombination rates in specific regions of the genome. Additionally, the context mentions that reiterated sequences in the human genome are targets for nonallelic homologous recombination, which facilitates genomic rearrangements. Taken together, these findings suggest that there is an increased recombination rate in human regulatory domains, particularly in regions containing imprinted genes and reiterated sequences.","mutational sites and chromosomal rearrangements that enhance or suppress recombination frequency in specific regions are known, but general mechanisms that enhance recombination have not yet been discovered.  human recombination rates vary along the chromosomes as well as between the two sexes.  homologous recombination is increased during meiosis between dna sequences at the same chromosomal position (allelic recombination) and at different chromosomal positions (ectopic recombination).  there is growing evidence that epigenetic factors may have an important influence on recombination rates, as well as on crossover position.  in higher organisms the rate of recombination between genetic loci is presumably responsive to selective pressure.  novel findings over the last 2 years have led to an increased emphasis on homologous recombination (hr) as both a pathway for dna repair and a cause for genomic rearrangements.  using both public database analysis and wet-bench approaches, we revisited the relationship between increased rates of meiotic recombination and genome imprinting.  there is also an excess of hot-spots of recombination at imprinted regions, and this is likely to do with the presence of imprinted genes, per se.  we tested whether dinucleotide repeats sequences are preferential sites for recombination because of their high affinity for recombination enzymes.  in this strain, rec-1, the number of reciprocal recombination events between linked loci is increased.  besides the obvious possibility of retrotransposition, gene rearrangements may be induced by sequences that stimulate genetic recombination.  several dna sequence elements are thought to stimulate homologous recombination, illegitimate recombination, or both in mammalian cells.  ectopic recombination between locally repeated dna sequences is of fundamental importance in the evolution of gene families, generating copy-number variation in human dna and often leading to pathological rearrangements.  recently, selective pressures and mutational events that influence recombination have been reviewed.  several lines of evidence suggest that reiterated sequences in the human genome are targets for nonallelic homologous recombination (nahr), which facilitates genomic rearrangements.  the past few years have seen an explosion of interest in understanding the role of regulatory dna.  crossing over in ectopic recombination, resulting in chromosomal rearrangements, was associated with 35-60% of recombination events and was stimulated 12-fold by m26.  recombination hotspots are important elements in controlling meiotic allelic recombination.  taken together, these findings support the involvement of a combination of specific dna sequences and epigenetic factors as major determinants of hot-spots of recombination at imprinted chromosomal regions.  when the dna in the ccc form is integrated into the e. coli genome by homologous recombination to form a directly repeated structure, a striking enhancement of excisional recombination between the repeats occurs. ||| ",No
Is GAGA associated with nucleosome-free regions (NFR)?,Yes,"The results suggest that GAGA functions as a transcription activating factor and is involved in the regulation of gene expression. The findings indicate that many nucleosome-free regions (NFRs) are formed and maintained by an active mechanism involving the ATP-dependent removal of nucleosomes. GAGA is a nuclear protein that is expressed in at least two isoforms, and the study of the GAGA(519) isoform as a transcription factor provides evidence for a novel 3' NFR that is present at >95% of all genes. The results also suggest that the AT-rich sequences present in many NFRs have little effect on the stability of nucleosomes. These findings support the notion that GAGA is associated with NFRs.","by means of its specific interaction with dna, gaga has been involved in several nuclear transactions including regulation of gene expression.  our results give support to the notion that gaga can function as a transcription activating factor.  gaga is a nuclear protein encoded by the trithorax-like gene in drosophila that is expressed in at least two isoforms generated by alternative splicing.  most nucleosomes are well-organized at the 5' ends of s. cerevisiae genes where ""-1"" and ""+1"" nucleosomes bracket a nucleosome-free promoter region (nfr).  at-rich dna is concentrated in the nucleosome-free regions (nfrs) associated with transcription start sites of most genes.  our findings suggest that many nfrs are formed and maintained by an active mechanism involving the atp-dependent removal of nucleosomes rather than a passive mechanism due to the intrinsic instability of nucleosomes on at-rich dna sequences.  tf binding occurs in nucleosome-depleted regions of dna (ndrs), which generally encompass regions with lengths similar to those protected by nucleosomes.  we tested the hypothesis that at-rich dna engenders nfr formation by virtue of its rigidity and consequent exclusion of nucleosomes.  we observed that g4s are located in gc-rich (euchromatin) regions and outside the fibrillarin-positive compartment of nucleoli.  rsc may remove nfr nucleosomes without effect on adjacent orf nucleosomes.  here we have studied the gaga(519) isoform as a transcription factor.  we present evidence for a novel 3' nfr that is present at >95% of all genes.  although the sequencing of the gtpase activating protein (gap)-related region of nf1 (nf1-grd) revealed no apparent mutation, the nf1-grd transcript (type i) and that containing an additional 63 bp insert in the center of nf1-grd (type ii) were equally expressed in most gastric cancer cells.  we found that the at-rich sequences present in many nfrs have little effect on the stability of nucleosomes.  when inactive, gasz, cftr, and cortbp2 preferentially associated with the nuclear periphery and with perinuclear heterochromatin, whereas in their actively transcribed states the gene loci preferentially associated with euchromatin in the nuclear interior.  in vivo, in drosophila sl2 cells, q-domain can transactivate reporter genes either in the form of gaga or gal4bd-q fusions, whereas a gaga mutant deleted of the q-domain cannot.  the present study was undertaken to determine the mechanism of nop25 localization in the nucleolus.  we show that xenopus oocytes and embryos contain gata-2, stored in nuclei as a non-chromatin-bound complex.  to functionally validate the putative nes motif, deletion and site-directed mutants were fused to an egfp expression vector and transfected into cos-7 cells, and the localization of the proteins was examined.  nop25 did not localize in the nucleolus by deletion of the peptide from nop25. ||| ",Yes
Is there any research that relates the function of Notch Signaling with Alzheimer Disease?,Yes,"Recent studies have identified Notch signaling as a contributor to neurodegeneration, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathophysiology. Aberrant Notch signaling has emerged as a possible mechanism for the altered neurogenesis, cognitive impairment, and learning and memory deficits associated with AD. Significant increases of Notch expression have been observed in brains from patients at later stages of sporadic AD. Notch receptors have been hypothesized to play a role in neurodegeneration, particularly in AD and CADASIL. Notch signaling plays an instrumental role in hippocampus-dependent memory formation, and recent evidence indicates a displacement of Notch1 and a reduction in its activity in hippocampal and cortical neurons from AD patients. Notch dysregulation may contribute to the neuritic dystrophy characteristically seen in AD brain. A functional relationship between amyloid precursor protein and Notch1 has been reported, which does not affect delta ligand binding. This finding suggests that Notch may be affected by APP gamma-secretase inhibitors under development for the treatment of AD, as these target PS1.

Can fetal aneuploidy be detected with non-invasive prenatal testing?,Yes,"Non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) enables the detection of common fetal aneuploidies, such as trisomy 21, trisomy 18, trisomy 13, and sex chromosome abnormalities, via the analysis of cell-free fetal DNA circulating in maternal serum. The purpose of NIPT is to detect fetal aneuploidy at chromosomes 13, 18, 21, X, and Y by analyzing fetal cell-free DNA from maternal blood, without endangering pregnancy. The noninvasive prenatal test has superior test characteristics compared to traditional screening methods, including a higher detection rate and positive predictive value, and a lower false-positive rate. The use of next-generation sequencing in NIPT allows for the comparison of maternal and fetal cfDNA ratios for chromosomes of interest to assess chromosomal aneuploidy.","the noninvasive prenatal test is a major advance in prenatal aneuploidy screening but it is not diagnostic and does not replace invasive testing (i.e.  the application of the dual-probe fish protocol on fetal cells isolated from maternal blood enables accurate molecular detection of fetal aneuploidy, thus providing a foundation for development of non-invasive prenatal diagnostic testing.  non-invasive prenatal testing (nipt) identifies fetal aneuploidy by sequencing cell-free dna in the maternal plasma.  noninvasive prenatal screening for fetal aneuploidy analyzes cell-free fetal dna circulating in the maternal plasma.  current non-invasive screening methods for the prenatal diagnosis of fetal aneuploidies are hampered by low sensitivities and high false positive rates.  detection of chromosomal aneuploidies using fetal cells isolated from maternal blood, for prenatal non-invasive genetic investigation, has been a long-sought goal of clinical genetics to replace amniocentesis and chorionic villous sampling to avoid any risk to the fetus.  understanding the relationship between aneuploidy detection on noninvasive prenatal testing (nipt) and occult maternal malignancies may explain results that are discordant with the fetal karyotype and improve maternal clinical care.  noninvasive prenatal test is positive for aneuploidy with a normal fetal karyotype) can occur because of biological processes such as aneuploidy confined to the placenta, a vanished twin, maternal aneuploidy or maternal cancer.  methylation-based non-invasive prenatal testing of fetal aneuploidies is an alternative method that could possibly improve fetal aneuploidy diagnosis, especially for trisomy 13(t13) and trisomy 18(t18).  the purpose of this study was to develop a sensitive and specific new assay for diagnosing aneuploidy with circulating fetal cells isolated from maternal blood as previously reported using two novel approaches: (i) simultaneous immunocytochemistry (icc) evaluation using a monoclonal antibody for i-antigen, followed by fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish); (ii) dual-probe fish analysis of interphase nuclei using two differently labeled probes, specific for different loci of chromosomes 21 and 18; in addition, short tandem repeats (str) analysis on single cells isolated by micromanipulation was applied to confirm the presence of fetal cells in the cell sample enriched from maternal blood.  objective noninvasive prenatal testing (nipt) enables the detection of common fetal aneuploidies such as trisomy 21, trisomy 18, trisomy 13, and sex chromosome abnormalities via analysis of cell-free fetal dna circulating in maternal serum.  the purpose of the study was to detect fetal aneuploidy at chromosomes 13, 18, 21, x, and y by analysis of fetal cell-free dna from maternal blood, without endangering pregnancy.  epigenetic allelic ratio analysis of maternal plasma dna represents a promising approach for noninvasive prenatal diagnosis of fetal chromosomal aneuploidies.  to assess the detection efficiency of noninvasive prenatal testing (nipt) for fetal autosomal aneuploidy, sex chromosome aneuploidy (sca), other chromosome aneuploidy, copy number variation (cnv), and to provide further data for clinical application of nipt.  current methods for noninvasive prenatal testing (nipt) ascertain fetal aneuploidies using either direct counting measures of dna fragments from specific genomic regions or relative measures of single nucleotide polymorphism frequencies.  current methods for prenatal diagnosis of chromosomal aneuploidies involve the invasive sampling of fetal materials using procedures such as amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling and constitute a finite risk to the fetus.  unlike the invasive diagnosis with high risk of miscarriage, non-invasive prenatal diagnosis (nipd) sampling from maternal blood becomes a promising way for fetal genetic screening.  compared to traditional screening using ultrasound and serum markers, the noninvasive prenatal test has superior test characteristics, including a higher detection rate and positive predictive value, and a lower false-positive rate.  using next-generation sequencing, the noninvasive prenatal test compares maternal and fetal cfdna ratios for chromosomes of interest (i.e., 21, 18, 13, x, and y) to assess chromosomal aneuploidy.  however, the use of maternal plasma fetal dna for the direct detection of fetal chromosomal aneuploidies has not been reported. ||| ",Yes
Is mitofusin 2 a receptor for parkin?,Yes,"The context suggests that mitofusin 2 (Mfn2) is indeed a receptor for parkin. It is stated that a phosphorylated form of Mfn2 serves as a receptor for parkin translocation to damaged mitochondria. Furthermore, Mfn2 is described as uniquely functioning as the mitochondrial receptor for parkin during PINK1-parkin-mediated mitophagy. The interaction of phosphorylated Mfn2 with parkin promotes the ubiquitination of mitochondrial proteins, which is a crucial step in the mitophagy process.","recent work demonstrates that a phosphorylated form of the mitochondrial fusion protein mitofusin 2 serves as a receptor for parkin translocation to damaged mitochondria.  more recent publications also described a link between parkin and mitophagy.  mitofusin (mfn)2 redundantly promotes mitochondrial outer membrane tethering and organelle fusion with mfn1, and uniquely functions as the mitochondrial receptor for parkin during pten-induced putative kinase 1 (pink1)-parkin-mediated mitophagy.  here, we show that parkin is selectively recruited to dysfunctional mitochondria with low membrane potential in mammalian cells.  phosphorylated mitofusin-2 (mfn2), a receptor of parkin rbr e3 ubiquitin-protein ligase (parkin), interacts with parkin to promote the ubiquitination of mitochondrial proteins; meanwhile, the mitophagy receptors optineurin (optn) and nuclear dot protein 52 (ndp52) are recruited to damaged mitochondria to promote mitophagy.  parkin was associated with mitochondrial transcription factor a (tfam) and enhanced tfam-mediated mitochondrial transcription.  although the role of parkin in neuron maintenance is unknown, recent work has linked parkin to the regulation of mitochondria.  parkin (park2), an e3 ubiquitin ligase, is critical to maintain mitochondrial function by regulating mitochondrial biogenesis and degradation (mitophagy), but recent evidence suggests the involvement of parkin in promoting inflammation.  parkin promotes cell survival by removing damaged mitochondria via mitophagy.  in the present study, we determined if parkin regulates airway mitochondrial dna (mtdna) release and inflammatory responses to type 2 cytokine interleukin (il)-13 and allergens.  parkin has been implicated in the regulation of mitophagy, a quality control process in which defective mitochondria are sequestered in autophagosomes and delivered to lysosomes for degradation.  parkin is an e3 ubiquitin ligase encoded by the park2 gene.  we describe a novel function of parkin, a ring protein, which is elaborately involved in mitochondrial biogenesis.  these results demonstrate that parkin plays a protective role in the maintenance of normal mitochondrial and contractile functions in skeletal muscles.  results of pharmacological treatments indicate that parkin was released from mitochondria when permeability transition pore was opened.  parkin is selectively recruited from the cytosol to damaged mitochondria to trigger their autophagy.  parkin is a cytosolic ubiquitin ligase that translocates to damaged mitochondria and promotes their degradation.  the protein parkin, encoded by the park2 gene, is vital for mitochondrial homeostasis, and although it has been implicated in parkinson's disease (pd), the disease mechanisms remain unclear.  overall, the results of the present study demonstrate that parkin plays a protective role in the maintenance of normal mitochondrial and contractile functions in normal skeletal muscles.  parkin, an e3 ubiquitin ligase encoded by the park2 gene, has been implicated in the regulation of mitophagy, a quality control process in which defective mitochondria are degraded. ||| ",Yes
Could plasmepsins be used as targets for developing anti-malaria drugs?,Yes,"The plasmepsins, a group of aspartic proteases found in malaria parasites, have been identified as potential targets for the development of antimalarial drugs. These enzymes play critical roles in the life cycle of the parasite and are differentially expressed in multiple stages of its development. Inhibition of plasmepsins has been shown to lead to parasite death, making them attractive targets for drug development. The high sequence conservation between plasmepsins from different isolates further supports their potential as reliable targets for new antimalarial chemotherapeutics. However, the development of effective plasmepsin inhibitors is complicated by their genomic diversity, which gives rise to a family of closely related targets rather than a single unique target. Despite this challenge, advances in antimalarial drug development are crucial for combating the increasing incidence of malaria.","therefore, the plasmepsins of malaria parasites have been recognized as attractive antimalarial drug targets.  plasmepsins (proteolytic enzymes of the parasite) have been considered as promising targets for the development of antimalarial drugs.  since plasmepsin inhibition leads to parasite death, these enzymes have been acknowledged to be important targets for the development of new antimalarial drugs.  malarial aspartic proteases - plasmepsins (plms) - are differentially expressed in multiple stages of the plasmodium parasite's lifecycle and are considered as attractive drug targets.  as inhibition of plasmepsins leads to the parasite's death, these enzymes can be utilized as potential drug targets.  the high sequence conservations between the plasmepsins from the isolates support the notion that the enzymes could be reliable targets for new antimalarial chemotherapeutics.  the plasmepsins are key enzymes in the life cycle of the plasmodium parasites responsible for malaria.  plasmepsin group of enzymes are key enzymes in the life cycle of malarial parasites.  the plasmepsins are the aspartic proteases of malaria parasites.  therefore, new compounds that potentially have a novel target in various developmental stages of plasmodium parasites are needed to treat patients and halt the spread of malaria.  potential new drug targets include plasmodium proteases that play critical roles in the parasite life cycle.  with the identification and characterization of new plasmepsins and the results from recent plasmepsin knockout studies, it now seems clear that in order to achieve high-antiparasitic activities in p. falciparum-infected erythrocytes it is necessary to inhibit several of the haemoglobin-degrading plasmepsins.  this review focuses on inhibitors of the haemoglobin-degrading plasmepsins of the most lethal species, p. falciparum; plm i, plm ii, plm iv, and histo-aspartic protease (hap).  the development of effective plasmepsin inhibitors, however, is compounded by their genomic diversity which gives rise not to a unique target for drug development but to a family of closely related targets.  plasmepsins, a family of aspartic proteases of plasmodium species, are known to participate in a wide variety of cellular processes essential for parasite survival.  identification of potential drug targets as well as development of novel antimalarial chemotherapies with unique mode of actions due to drug resistance by plasmodium parasites are inevitable.  in this paper, we discuss the synthesis, crystal structures and inhibitory nature of these two compounds which have a potential to inhibit plasmepsins.  advances in antimalarial drug development are important for combating malaria.  in this paper, we discuss the application of the thermodynamic approach to the development of high affinity (k(i) - pm) plasmepsin inhibitors.  the incidence of malaria is increasing, and there is an urgent need to identify new drug targets for both prophylaxis and chemotherapy. ||| ",Yes
Is Alpers disease inherited in an autosomal recessive mode?,Yes,"Alpers-Huttenlocher Syndrome (AHS) is indeed inherited in an autosomal recessive mode. This means that an individual must inherit two copies of the mutated gene, one from each parent, to develop the disorder. The autosomal recessive nature of inheritance is a common feature in several genetic disorders, including Alpers-Huttenlocher Syndrome and Alström Syndrome. In the context of Alport Syndrome, while most cases are either X-linked or autosomal recessive, a small percentage (15%) of patients have autosomal recessive inheritance caused by two pathogenic mutations in either COL4A3 or COL4A4 genes. This further supports the concept that genetic heterogeneity is a well-known feature of Alport Syndrome, and patient phenotypes may vary depending on the underlying mutations.","alpers-huttenlocher syndrome (ahs) is a very rare autosomal recessive disorder.  alström syndrome has an autosomal recessive nature of inheritance.  these results indicate that the protein abnormality in autosomal dominant alport syndrome does not produce the retinopathy and lenticonus typical of x-linked and autosomal recessive disease.  we have examined the eyes in the members of two families where alport syndrome was diagnosed on the basis of the clinical features and family history, and where autosomal dominant inheritance was confirmed by father-to-son disease transmission, the associated haematological abnormalities, and haplotypes that segregated with the recently described locus at chromosome 22q.  autosomal recessive inheritance is increased in females with alport syndrome and early onset renal failure, hearing loss, lenticonus, and, possibly, central retinopathy.  this study determined the family history and clinical features that suggested autosomal recessive rather than x-linked alport syndrome.  fifteen percent of patients with alport syndrome have autosomal recessive inheritance caused by two pathogenic mutations in either col4a3 or col4a4.  alport syndrome (as) is genetically heterogeneous.  most patients with alport syndrome have x-linked or autosomal recessive disease that is characterised by renal failure, hearing loss, and, in nearly 75% of the cases, a dot-and-fleck retinopathy and anterior lenticonus.  alport's syndrome is a heterogeneous disorder made up of a number of genetically distinct syndromes, with an autosomal dominant, an x-linked dominant and a rare autosomal recessive form.  an autosomal dominant variety of alport syndrome also exists, but mutations in this form of the disease have not yet been described.  most families with as show an x-linked dominant pattern of inheritance but about 15% of families show an autosomal inheritance of the disease.  we have examined the eyes of a family with autosomal recessive alport syndrome.  fourteen (93 %) individuals with autosomal recessive alport syndrome developed early end-stage renal failure, all 15 had hearing loss, and most had lenticonus (12, 80 %), and a central (13, 87 %) or peripheral (13, 87 %) retinopathy.  genetic heterogeneity is a well-known feature of alport syndrome (as).  autosomal recessive alport syndrome is suspected in consanguineous families and when female patients develop renal failure.  in conclusion, patient phenotypes may vary depending on the underlying mutations, and genetic testing should be considered for the routine diagnosis of autosomal recessive alport syndrome.  alport syndrome (as) is a genetically heterogeneous hereditary renal disease.  autosomal dominant alport syndrome is caused by a mutation in the gene encoding type iv collagen α3 (α3); (col4a3), or α4 (α4); (col4a4).  the mode of inheritance of alport syndrome (ats) has long been controversial. ||| ",Yes
Does a selective sweep increase genetic variation?,No,"A selective sweep does not increase genetic variation. Instead, it results in a reduction of variation at presumably neutrally evolving sites in the genome. This phenomenon is caused by the spread of a selected allele at a linked focal site, which is driven by strong positive selection. As the frequency of the favored allele increases in the population, the neighboring linked variation diminishes due to genetic hitchhiking, creating so-called selective sweeps. This process can dramatically alter the pattern and distribution of allelic diversity in a population.","selective sweep is a phenomenon of reduced variation at presumably neutrally evolving sites (hitchhikers) in the genome that is caused by the spread of a selected allele at a linked focal site, and is widely used to test for action of positive selection.  a selective sweep is the result of strong positive selection driving newly occurring or standing genetic variants to fixation, and can dramatically alter the pattern and distribution of allelic diversity in a population.  we have demonstrated this possibility in relation to ancient selective sweep for modern human-specific changes and ongoing selective sweep for local population-specific changes.  the allele frequency of a neutral variant in a population is pushed either upward or downward by directional selection on a linked beneficial mutation (""selective sweeps"").  this process, known as ""selective sweep,"" was studied by comparing molecular variation between the polymorphic in(2l)t inversion and the standard chromosome.  classic selective sweeps occur when positive selection increases a variant's frequency from low to high in a population, and underlie some long-studied human characteristics such as variation in skin, hair or eye colour.  adaptive alleles may rise in frequency as a consequence of positive selection, creating a pattern of decreased variation in the neighboring loci, known as a selective sweep.  the frequency of the favored allele increases in the population and due to genetic hitchhiking the neighboring linked variation diminishes, creating so-called selective sweeps.  population-level sequencing data have enabled discoveries of selective sweeps associated with genes involved in recent adaptations in many species.  adaptation from standing genetic variation or recurrent de novo mutation in large populations should commonly generate soft rather than hard selective sweeps.  dominance can affect sweep patterns in outcrossers if the derived variant originates from either a single novel allele, or from recurrent mutation.  by identifying ""sweeping haplotypes (shs)"" that putatively carry beneficial alleles and are increasing (or have increased) rapidly in frequency, and surveying the geographic distribution of sh frequencies, we can indirectly infer how selective sweeps unfold in time and thus which modes of positive selection underlie those sweeps.  in the case of a hard selective sweep, a single adaptive haplotype rises to high population frequency, whereas multiple adaptive haplotypes sweep through the population simultaneously in a soft sweep, producing distinct patterns of genetic variation in the vicinity of the selected site.  as a result, 2 characteristic traits of selective sweeps--the reduction of variation and the departure from selective neutrality in haplotype tests--show a bimodal pattern.  in contrast to a hard selective sweep, in which a single adaptive haplotype rises to high population frequency, in a soft selective sweep multiple adaptive haplotypes sweep through the population simultaneously, producing distinct patterns of genetic variation in the vicinity of the adaptive site.  we assess approaches for large-scale association of classic sweep candidate variants to phenotypes and selective forces, test these on the gold standards, and discuss the standards of evidence needed to adequately understand a selective sweep.  however, positive selection may often proceed via ""soft sweeps"" acting on mutations already present within a population.  we consider how arbitrary dominance and inbreeding via self-fertilization affect hard and soft sweep signatures.  we examined the evidence for classic sweeps in resequencing data from 179 human genomes.  here, we develop a statistical test based on a measure of haplotype homozygosity (h12) that is capable of detecting both hard and soft sweeps with similar power. ||| ",No

Therefore, HDAC inhibitors hold promise as candidates to control metastasis of solid tumors.","histone deacetylase (hdac) is recognized as one of the promising targets for cancer treatment as many hdac inhibitors have entered clinical trials for both solid and liquid tumors.  histone deacetylase inhibitors (hdaci) are promising therapeutics for cancer.  histone deacetylases (hdacs), which modulate the expression of genes, are potential therapeutic targets in several cancers.  histone deacetylase (hdac) inhibitors are emerging as an exciting new class of potential anti-cancer agents for the treatment of solid and hematological malignancies.  histone deacetylases (hdacs) play an important role in regulating the expression of genes involved in tumorigenesis and tumor maintenance, and hence they have been considered as key targets in cancer therapy.  histone deacetylases (hdacs) are implicated in the pathology of various cancers, and their pharmacological blockade has proven to be promising in reversing the malignant phenotypes.  accumulating evidence demonstrates important roles for histone deacetylase in tumorigenesis (hdacs), highlighting them as attractive targets for antitumor drug development.  histone deacetylase inhibitors (hdaci) have been enthusiastically investigated as a novel generation of chemotherapeutics for cancers usually called as epigenetic therapeutics.  histone deactylase inhibitors (hdacis), which have shown favorable anti-tumor activity with low toxicity in clinical investigations, are a promising class of anticancer therapeutics.  histone deacetylases (hdacs), enzymes involved in chromatin remodeling, are promising targets for anticancer drug development.  histone deacetylase inhibitors (hdaci) are promising antitumor drugs acting through reactivation of silenced tumor suppressor genes.  histone deacetylases (hdacs) are a class of epigenetic modulators overexpressed in numerous types of cancers.  histone deacetylases (hdacs) have gained increased attention as targets for anticancer drug design and development.  histone deacetylases (hdacs) are considered to be among the most promising targets in drug development for cancer therapy, and first-generation histone deacetylase inhibitors (hdaci) are currently being tested in phase i/ii clinical trials.  histone deacetylase inhibitors are novel anticancer agents in clinical development that target the family of histone deacetylase (hdac) enzymes responsible for deacetylating core nucleosomal histones and other proteins.  as a novel category of antitumor agents, histone deacetylase inhibitors (hdacis) can induce cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and differentiation in cancer cells, ultimately combating cancer.  the histone deacetylases (hdacs) are able to regulate gene expression, and inhibitors of the hdacs (hdacis) hold promise in the treatment of cancer as well as a variety of neurodegenerative diseases.  inhibitors of histone deacetylase superfamily (hdac), which induce cell cycle arrest, trigger cell death and reduce angiogenesis appear as promising anti-cancer drugs targeting the epigenetic regulation of gene expression.  histone deacetylases (hdacs) regulate transcription and specific functions, such as tumor suppression by p53, and are frequently altered in cancer.  histone deacetylases (hdacs) are epigenetic regulators of chromatin condensation and decondensation and exert effects on the proliferation and spread of cancer. ||| ",Yes
Is Titin the largest single protein molecule found in Nature?,Yes,"Titin, also known as connectin, is the largest single protein molecule found in nature to date. With a relative molecular mass of approximately 3 x 10^6, it is a gigantic protein located in the thick filament of vertebrate muscles. Titin is a multidomain muscle protein that forms a major component of the sarcomere in vertebrate striated muscle. It is responsible for the passive elasticity of muscles and plays a critical role in muscle assembly and elasticity. Despite its size, the global and local structure and function of titin are still largely undiscovered. However, it is known to function as a giant molecular spring and a scaffold for several sarcomeric proteins. Therefore, it can be concluded that Titin is indeed the largest single protein molecule found in nature.","titin/connectin, encoded by the ttn gene, is the largest protein in humans.  titin is the largest polypeptide yet described (relative molecular mass approximately 3 x 10(6); refs 1, 2) and an abundant protein of striated muscle.  titin is a gigantic protein located in the thick filament of vertebrate muscles.  titin, the biggest single (poly) peptide found in humans, and throughout nature so far, was long considered as a good candidate for inherited muscle diseases.  titin, the largest single chain protein known so far, has long been known to play a critical role in passive muscle function but recent studies have highlighted titin's role in active muscle function.  the giant muscle protein titin is the largest protein in cells and responsible for the passive elasticity of muscles.  titin is a giant, multidomain muscle protein forming a major component of the sarcomere in vertebrate striated muscle.  titin, also known as connectin, is a giant modular protein specifically found in vertebrate striated muscle.  titin is a huge protein ( approximately 3 mda) that is present in the contractile unit (sarcomere) of striated muscle and has a key role in muscle assembly and elasticity.  "" titin "" is a term used to describe a pair of closely related megadalton polypeptides that together are the third most abundant myofibrillar protein in a wide range of striated muscles.  titin is a giant elastomeric protein responsible for the generation of passive muscle force.  the protein titin plays a key role in vertebrate muscle where it acts like a giant molecular spring.  the details of the global and local structure and function of titin, a giant filamentous intrasarcomeric protein are largely undiscovered.  titin, made of hundreds of individually folded globular domains, is a protein polymer with folded globular domains as its macromonomers.  titin is a filamentous protein spanning the half-sarcomere, with spring-like properties in the i-band region.  in this article we review the current known structure and functions of this elementary molecule with some emphasis on the only defects so far known to cause human skeletal muscle disease, mutations in the c-terminal m-line part of titin.  since its belated discovery, our understanding of the giant protein titin has grown exponentially from its humble beginning as a sarcomeric scaffold to recent recognition of its critical mechanical and signaling functions in active muscle.  titin is a giant protein responsible for muscle elasticity and provides a scaffold for several sarcomeric proteins, including the novel titin-binding protein murf-1, which binds near the titin m-line region.  titin is a giant elastomeric muscle protein that has been suggested to function as a sensor of sarcomeric stress and strain, but the mechanisms by which it does so are unresolved.  it has been proposed that titin and another giant protein, nebulin , are the major components of an elastic cytoskeletal lattice within the sarcomere. ||| ",Yes
Is protein M3/6 a dual specificity phosphatase?,Yes,"The context indicates that M3/6 is a novel murine mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase (MKP) that is uniquely specific for c-Jun N-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase and p38 kinase. MKPs are dual-specificity phosphatases that regulate MAP kinase signaling. The deduced amino acid sequence of MKP-M, a homologous protein to M3/6, is most similar to those of HVH-5 (or mouse M3/6) and VHP1, a Caenorhabditis elegans tyrosine phosphatase. This suggests that M3/6 is a dual-specificity phosphatase, as it shares sequence similarity with other known dual-specificity phosphatases.","we have isolated a cdna homologous to known dual-specificity phosphatases from a mouse macrophage cdna library and termed it mkp-m (for mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase isolated from macrophages).  map kinase phosphatase 3 (mkp3, also known as dusp6 and pyst1) is involved in extracellular signal receptor kinase (erk) regulation and functions as a specific phosphatase to the activated (phosphorylated) forms of erk1 and erk2.  map kinase phosphatase (mkp)-3 is a cytoplasmic dual specificity protein phosphatase that specifically binds to and inactivates the erk1/2 map kinases in mammalian cells.  the deduced amino acid sequence of mkp-m is most similar to those of hvh-5 (or mouse m3/6) and vhp1, a caenorhabditis elegans tyrosine phosphatase.  we recently described a novel murine mkp, m3/6, which is uniquely specific for c-jun n-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase and p38 kinase.  myotubularin-related protein 1 (mtmr1) is a phosphatase that belongs to the tyrosine/dual-specificity phosphatase superfamily.  the nucleophilic cysteine residue and the adjacent histidine residue, which are conserved in all active dual-specificity phosphatases, are replaced by serine and phenylalanine residues respectively in mk-styx.  this and further structure-function analyses showed that m3 is required for catalysis by providing a water molecule as a proton donor during catalysis.  myosin phosphatase (mp) holoenzyme is a ser/thr specific enzyme, which is the member of protein phosphatase type 1 (pp1) family and composed of a pp1 catalytic subunit (pp1c/ppp1cb) and a myosin phosphatase targeting subunit (mypt1/ppp1r12a).  its activity depends on two metal ions in the catalytic site, which were identified as manganese in the bacterially expressed phosphatase.  mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase 2 (mkp2) is a member of the dual-specificity mkps that regulate map kinase signaling.  myosin phosphatase (mp) holoenzyme is a protein phosphatase-1 (pp1) type ser/thr specific enzyme that consists of a pp1 catalytic (pp1c) and a myosin phosphatase target subunit-1 (mypt1).  whereas the crystal structure of human pp2cα displayed two tightly bound mn2+ ions in the active site, recent investigations of ppm phosphatases have characterized the binding of a third, catalytically essential metal ion.  mtmr1 has been shown to use phosphatidylinositol 3-monophosphate (pi(3)p) and/or phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate (pi(3,5)p2) as substrates.  the myosin phosphatase (mp) holoenzyme is composed of a protein phosphatase type 1 (pp1) catalytic subunit and a regulatory subunit termed myosin phosphatase target subunit 1 (mypt1).  the amino-terminal noncatalytic domain of mkp-3 is both necessary and sufficient for nuclear export of the phosphatase and contains a single functional leucine-rich nuclear export signal (nes).  this suggests that the first aspartate of the motif is also the phosphorylated residue in l-3-phosphoserine phosphatase.  the myosin phosphatase (mp) composed of the catalytic subunit of type 1 protein phosphatase and myosin phosphatase target subunit isoform 1 (mypt1) was identified as the major serine/threonine phosphatase component in the platelet-cytoskeleton fraction.  protein phosphatase m (ppm) regulates key signaling pathways in prokaryotes and eukaryotes.  the gene consists of six exons. ||| ",Yes
Is skin color affected by variations of the SLC24A5 gene?,Yes,"The SLC24A5 gene, which encodes a potent potassium-dependent sodium-calcium exchanger, is known to play a key role in human pigmentation. Variants of this gene, including a non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphism, have been shown to correlate with lighter skin pigmentation in humans. These variants affect pigmentation in both humans and zebrafish by altering melanosome biogenesis via ionic changes. The SLC24A5 gene is also associated with oculocutaneous albinism type 6 (OCA6) disorder, which is characterized by reduced melanin content and pigmentation. Knockdown analyses have further demonstrated the importance of SLC24A5 for pigmentation. In conclusion, variations in the SLC24A5 gene have been found to significantly impact skin color.","a non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphism in the human slc24a5 gene is associated with natural human skin color variation.  a variant allele of slc24a5, the gene encoding nckx5, has been shown to correlate with lighter skin pigmentation in humans, indicating a key role for slc24a5 in determining human skin colour.  solute carrier family 24 member 5 (slc24a5) is a gene that is associated with oculocutaneous albinism type 6 (oca6) disorder and is involved in skin and hair pigmentation.  the slc24a5 gene, the human orthologue of the zebrafish golden gene, has been shown to play a key role in human pigmentation.  similar to morphants, homozygous slc24a5ko mutants had significantly reduced melanin content and pigmentation.  deficient slc24a5 activity results in oculocutaneous albinism (oca) type 6 in humans.  variants of the slc24a5 gene, which encodes a putative potassium-dependent sodium-calcium exchanger (nckx5) that most likely resides in the melanosome or its precursor, affect pigmentation in both humans and zebrafish (danio rerio).  slc24a5, encoding a potent k+ -dependent na+ /ca2+ exchanger, is among the known color-coding genes that participate in melanogenesis by maintaining ph in melanosomes.  slc45a2 mutations cause oculocutaneous albinism type 4 (oca4) and polymorphisms are associated with pigmentation variation, but the localization, function, and regulation of slc45a2 and its variants remain unknown.  knockdown analyses have shown slc24a5 to be important for pigmentation, but to date the function of this ion exchanger in melanogenesis has not been fully established.  twenty-two variants (single nucleotide polymorphisms - snps) of the genes involved in hair pigmentation (oca2, herc2, mc1r, slc24a5, slc45a2, tpcn2, tyr, tyrp1) were genotyped in a group of 186 polish participants, representing a range of hair colours (45 red, 64 blond, 77 dark).  this finding suggests that genetic variations influencing human skin pigmentation alter melanosome biogenesis via ionic changes.  our findings illustrate significant variation worldwide at slc6a4 and that the functionally implicated alleles at the snps rs25531, rs25532, and rs6355 occur on limited haplotypes and vary significantly in global distribution.  our data suggest that slc45a2 maintains melanosome neutralization that is initially orchestrated by transient oca2 activity to support melanization at late stages of melanosome maturation, and that a common allelic variant imparts reduced activity due to protein instability.  the results are consistent with a previous finding and in accord with most of the results obtained in caucasian subjects that slc6a4 genotype is not related, at least by itself, to a response to treatment in either ethnic group to any clinically significant degree.  moreover, the light skin-associated slc45a2 allelic f374 variant restores only moderate pigmentation to slc45a2-deficient melanocytes due to rapid proteasome-dependent degradation resulting in lower protein expression levels in melanosomes than the dark skin-associated allelic l374 variant.  slc24a5 expression has been found to be elevated in melanoma.  slc24a5 is expressed in the melanophores as they differentiate from the neural crest and develop in the rpe of the eye.  in conclusion, common variation in the slc22a3 gene is unlikely to significantly contribute to pancreatic cancer risk.  skin pigmentation is a highly heterogeneous trait with diverse consequences worldwide. ||| ",Yes
Does Serca2a bind PLN in the heart?,Yes,"The context indicates that phospholamban (PLN) regulates the function of SERCA2a via its ser(16)-phosphorylation, and that PLN is an inhibitor of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA). Furthermore, it is stated that PLN and its homologue sarcolipin (SLN) are the endogenous regulators of SERCA2a, and that PLN regulates SERCA2a in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). These findings suggest that SERCA2a binds PLN in the heart.","this review focuses on advances in the understanding of molecular regulation of serca2a by pln and sln, and their implications for cardiac hypertrophy and failure in vivo.  in a co-immunoprecipitation of pln with serca2a, the physical interaction between the two proteins was increased in pugnac-treated cardiomyocytes.  during heart failure, pln expression is downregulated with serca2a; however, the mechanism of its regulation is not fully understood.  these data show that overexpression of nf-sln can inhibit serca2a in the absence of pln and that the inhibition of serca2a is correlated with impairment of contractility and calcium cycling in cardiomyocytes.  phospholamban (pln) regulates the function of serca2a via its ser(16)-phosphorylation.  phospholamban (pln) regulates cardiac type sarco (endo)plasmic reticulum ca(2+)-atpase (serca2a) via ser(16)-phosphorylation.  sarcolipin (sln) inhibits the cardiac sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum ca2+ atpase (serca2a) by direct binding and is superinhibitory if it binds as a binary complex with phospholamban (pln).  phospholamban (plb) regulates the cardiac ca2+-atpase (serca2a) in sarcoplasmic reticulum (sr).  in nf-sln tg/pln ko cardiac microsomes, the apparent affinity of serca2a for ca2+ was decreased compared with non-tg littermate pln ko hearts.  phospholamban (pln) and its homologue sarcolipin (sln) are the endogenous regulators of serca2a.  evidence is accumulating that serca2a is intimately involved in the pathogenesis of cardiac hypertrophy and failure.  cardiac-type sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum ca(2)-atpase (serca2a) plays a major role in cardiac muscle contractility.  recent studies using transgenic mouse models have demonstrated that sln is an important regulator of cardiac sr ca2+ atpase 2a (serca2a).  highly specific monoclonal antibodies were used to compare the subcellular distributions of serca2a, plb, and junctin (jcn) in dog heart tissue.  phospholamban (plb) is an inhibitor of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (sr) ca2+-atpase (serca).  the cardiac isoform of sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum ca(2)(+) adenosine triphosphatase (serca2a) plays an important role in the contraction and relaxation of cardiac muscle.  since the type 2 sarco/endoplasmic reticulum ca2+ atpase (serca2a) plays a central role in cardiac ca2+ homeostasis, we studied whether ps1 regulates the cardiac serca2a function.  this might define a novel mechanism by which pln regulation of serca2a is altered under conditions where o-glcnacylation is increased, such as those occurring in diabetes.  inducible deletion of speg decreased serca2a-thr484 phosphorylation and its oligomerization in the heart.  phospholamban (plb) stoichiometrically regulates the cardiac ca2+ pump (serca2a) in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (sr); but in the nuclear envelope (ne) of cardiomyocytes (cms), the plb to serca2a molar ratio is higher, which highlights our poor understanding of how sr proteins distribute to their functional subcompartments. ||| ",Yes
Does Yersinia pestis causes a respiratory infection?,Yes,"Yersinia pestis is indeed capable of causing a respiratory infection, specifically pneumonic plague. This is evident from the context, which states that following inhalation, Yersinia pestis rapidly colonizes the lung to establish infection during primary pneumonic plague. This process indicates that Yersinia pestis can cause a respiratory infection, as it directly affects the lungs upon inhalation. The context also mentions that Yersinia pestis is the causative agent of plague, a disease that can manifest as either bubonic or pneumonic plague. Pneumonic plague, in particular, is a severe lung infection caused by Yersinia pestis.","yersinia pestis causes the fatal respiratory disease pneumonic plague.  yersinia pestis, a psychrotrophic pathogen capable of growth at refrigeration temperatures, can cause pharyngeal and gastrointestinal plague in humans that consume contaminated foods.  this review discusses yersinial virulence factors, mechanisms of infection, and host responses in addition to the current state of surveillance, detection, and prevention of yersiniosis.  yersinia pestis is the causative agent of plague, a disease that can manifest as either bubonic or pneumonic plague.  yersiniosis is primarily caused by yersinia enterocolitica and less frequently by yersinia pseudotuberculosis.  yersinia pestis is the causative agent of bubonic plague.  following inhalation, yersinia pestis rapidly colonizes the lung to establish infection during primary pneumonic plague.  yersinia enterocolitica is a zoonotic agent that causes gastrointestinal disease in humans, as well as reactive arthritis and erythema nodosum.  the third pathogenic yersinia, yersinia enterocolitica, also causes gastroenteritis but is distantly related to y. pestis and y. pseudotuberculosis.  evidence indicates that y. pestis evolved from yersinia pseudotuberculosis, an enteric pathogen that normally causes a relatively mild disease.  however, there are studies indicating that y. pestis invades and causes systemic infection from ingestive and aerogenic routes of infection.  yersinia pestis, a gram-negative bacterium and the etiologic agent of plague, has evolved from yersinia pseudotuberculosis, a cause of a mild enteric disease.  yersinia pestis is the aetiological agent of plague, a disease of humans that has potentially devastating consequences.  yersinia pestis, the plague bacillus, has an exceptional pathogenicity for humans.  y. pestis is a recently derived clone of the pathogenic species yersinia pseudotuberculosis, but is more associated with human infection.  yersinia pestis, the causative agent of plague, is a recently evolved clone of the enteropathogenic bacterium yersinia pseudotuberculosis.  yersinia secretes virulence factors to subvert critical pathways in the host cell.  y. pestis recently evolved from the gastrointestinal pathogen y. pseudotuberculosis; however, it is not known at what point y. pestis gained the ability to induce a fulminant pneumonia.  yersinia enterocolitica is a facultative intracellular pathogen and a causative agent of yersiniosis, which can be contracted by ingestion of contaminated food.  yersiniosis is a food-borne illness that has become more prevalent in recent years due to human transmission via the fecal-oral route and prevalence in farm animals. ||| ",Yes
Do cephalopods use RNA editing less frequently than other species?,No,"The context indicates that cephalopods use RNA editing extensively to increase the regulatory complexity of their nervous systems. This suggests that cephalopods do not use RNA editing less frequently than other species, but rather that they employ it to a significant extent. The context also mentions that mammals use RNA editing, but less prominently, which further supports the idea that cephalopods are not among the species that use RNA editing less frequently.","we show, that as in cephalopods, adar genes in amphioxus are predominantly expressed in the nervous system; we identify a number of rna editing events in amphioxus; and we provide a newly developed method to identify rna editing events in highly polymorphic genomes using orthology as a guide.  cephalopods use it extensively to increase the regulatory complexity of their nervous systems, and mammals use it too, but less prominently.  here we analyze a key element of the editing machinery, the adar (adenosine deaminase acting on rna) gene family, in an animal with a key phylogenetic position at the root of chordates: the cephalochordate amphioxus.  overall, our work lays the foundations for future comparative analysis of rna-editing events across the metazoan tree.  a search of the cephalochordate cnes around 50 developmental genes in several vertebrate genomes revealed eight cnes conserved between cephalochordates and vertebrates, indicating sequence conservation over >500 million years of divergence.  rna editing is a relatively unexplored process in which transcribed rna is modified at specific nucleotides before translation, adding another level of regulation of gene expression.  cephalochordates, the sister group of vertebrates + tunicates, are evolving particularly slowly.  to more effectively identify cnes with potential regulatory functions, we compared noncoding sequences of genomes of the most phylogenetically distant cephalochordate genera, asymmetron and branchiostoma, which diverged approximately 120-160 million years ago.  non-coding y rnas and stem-bulge rnas are homologous small rnas in vertebrates and nematodes, respectively.  relative rate of sequence evolution showed that caecilian hox genes evolved significantly more slowly than the other tetrapod species used in this study and were comparable to the slowly evolving coelacanth hox genes.  nevertheless, little is known about the specifics of rna editing in most of the other clades and the relevance of rna editing from an evolutionary perspective remains unknown.  rates of synonymous and nonsynonymous nucleotide substitutions and codon usage bias (enc) were estimated for a number of nuclear and chloroplast genes in a sample of centric and pennate diatoms.  cephalochordates (amphioxus) are invertebrate chordates closely related to vertebrates.  here we describe methods for continuous laboratory breeding cultures of the cephalochordate branchiostoma floridae and the talen and tol2 methods for mutagenesis.  in the present study, we analyzed newly obtained ribosomal gene sequences of the odontostomatids discomorphella pedroeneasi and saprodinium dentatum, together with sequences from the literature, including epalxella antiquorum and a large assemblage of ciliate sequences representing the major recognized classes.  these methods should be applicable to any warm water species of cephalochordates with a relatively short generation time of 3-4 months and a life span of 3 years or more.  both rnas are phylogenetically closer related to nematode sbrnas than to vertebrate y rnas.  the crustacean genes are significantly less a + t-rich than their counterpart in insects and the pattern of codon usage (ratio of g + c-rich versus a + t-rich codon) is less biased.  a single cluster of functional genes is preserved throughout tetrapod evolution, which however exhibits clade-specific tandem duplications, gene-losses, and rearrangements.  in contrast to other invertebrates studied, mnemiopsis leidyi has lower levels of genome-wide 5-mc methylation, but higher levels of 5-mc methylation in promoters when compared with gene bodies. ||| ",No
Is transcapillary  albumin escape altered in diabetic patients?,Yes,"The transcapillary escape rate of albumin is altered in diabetic patients. In patients with elevated urinary albumin excretion, including those with incipient or clinical nephropathy, the transcapillary escape rate of albumin is significantly increased compared to control subjects and normoalbuminuric patients. This increase is observed even in patients with a modest increase in albuminuria. The transcapillary escape rate of albumin is often elevated in patients with diabetic microangiopathy. The enhanced albumin passage through the wall of the microvasculature is pressure-dependent to a large extent. The increased leak of albumin is not explained by differences in diabetes duration, blood pressure, or metabolic control at the time of investigation and is independently related to the presence of microalbuminuria and mean historical HbA1c.","diabetic patients with elevated urinary albumin excretion rate (incipient or clinical nephropathy) also have an increased transcapillary escape rate of albumin.  the transcapillary escape rate of albumin was similar in the control subjects (5.2 +/- 2.7%) and the subjects in the normoalbuminuric groups 3 and 4 (6.2 +/- 1.9 and 5.1 +/- 1.4%, respectively) and significantly lower (p < 0.001) than in patients with elevated urinary albumin excretion without or with hypertension group 2, 10.1 +/- 2.8 and group 5, 11.4 +/- 5.7%.  the effect of hypotensive therapy on the transcapillary escape rate of albumin (teralb) was studied in eight hypertensive insulin-dependent diabetic patients (mean age 29, range 19-42 years) with nephropathy and retinopathy.  indeed, transcapillary escape of albumin (teralb), a measure of systemic capillary efflux, is increased in diabetic patients, even in those with a modest increase of albuminuria.  to evaluate microvascular permeability by the transcapillary escape rate of albumin (teralb) in type ii diabetic patients with normo- and microalbuminuria.  to study the pathophysiologic mechanism leading to increased transcapillar sieving of albumin in patients with diabetic nephropathy, subcutaneous interstitial concentrations of albumin, transferrin, total igg and igg-4 was measured in 30 long-term type 1 diabetic patients using the skin suction blister method.  the transcapillary escape rate of albumin (teralb) is often elevated in patients with diabetic microangiopathy.  to test the hypothesis that insulin influences protein permeability, we measured the albumin transcapillary escape rate (ter) by the (131)i-labeled albumin technique in 12 healthy volunteers and 12 normoalbuminuric niddm patients (fasting plasma glucose, 10.9 +/- 1.3 mmol/l) during 4 h of isoglycemia with high (1.1 mu x min(-1) x kg(-1)) or, on a different day, low (0.1 mu x min(-1) x kg(-1)) insulin infusion.  we studied the following in normo- and microalbuminuric hypertensive type 2 diabetic patients: 1) transcapillary escape rate of albumin (teralb) and 2) expression of mrna slit diaphragm and podocyte proteins in renal biopsies.  transcapillary escape rate of albumin (initial disappearance of intravenously injected 125i-labelled human serum albumin), urinary albumin excretion rate (radial immunodiffusion), and glomerular filtrate rate (single bolus 51-cr-edta technique) were measured.  an increase in urinary albumin excretion (uae) in type 1 diabetic patients might reflect changes in vascular permeability and/or local haemodynamic factors.  human serum albumin was purified from diabetic patients in pre-dialysis (glomerular filtration rate  between 15 and 29 ml min(-1) 1.73 m(-2)) and those in dialysis (gfr ≤ 15 ml min(-1) 1.73 m(-2)) and then compared with albumin from patients with a normal gfr (>90 ml min(-1) m(-2)).  the fractional plasma escape rates of glycated and non-glycated albumin have earlier been measured in groups of type 1 (insulin-dependent) diabetic patients and control subjects.  the following variables were measured: transcapillary escape rate of albumin (initial disappearance of intravenously injected 125i-labelled human serum albumin), and urinary albumin excretion rate (radial immunodiffusion).  the escape of non-glycated albumin was similar in control subjects and normoalbuminuric patients, but elevated in patients with micro or macroalbuminuria.  our findings demonstrate that the enhanced albumin passage through the wall of the microvasculature characteristically found in long-term type 1 diabetic patients with clinical microangiopathy is pressure-dependent to a large extent.  in contrast, high insulin increased renal albumin excretion (from 3.6 +/- 0.8 to 5.4 +/- 1.1 microg/min, p < 0.01) and clearance rate (0.09 +/- 0.02 to 0.13 +/- 0.03 microl/min, p < 0.001) in patients but not in control subjects.  albumin was isolated from type 1 (dm1) and type 2 (dm2) diabetes mellitus (hba1c > 9%) and non-dm subjects (c).  changes in the antioxidant capacity of albumin and alterations of the albumin structural conformation were examined in patients in advanced stages of diabetes nephropathy.  the increased leak of albumin was not explained by differences in diabetes duration, bp, or metabolic control at the time of investigation and was independently related to the presence of microalbuminuria (r = 0.63, percent explained variance approximately 40) and mean ""historical"" hba1c (multiple r = 0.705; total explained variance approximately 50%). ||| ",Yes
Does dronedarone  affect  T3 and T4 levels?,Yes,"Dronedarone has been observed to affect T3 and T4 levels. In the context provided, dronedarone induced hyperthyroidism at the early stage and hypothyroidism at the late stage. This suggests that dronedarone can influence T3 and T4 levels, as these hormones are key markers of thyroid function. Furthermore, it was found that both dronedarone and amiodarone cause a decrease in intracellular T3 in all tissues, and an increase in T4 in most tissues. In a study with Wistar rats, dronedarone treatment resulted in cardioprotection by selectively mimicking hypothyroidism, which is characterized by low T3 and T4 levels. Therefore, it can be concluded that dronedarone does affect T3 and T4 levels.","both dronedarone and amiodarone can induce dyslipidemia and increase the levels of tc, ldl-c, and hdl-c, and these effects may be associated with thyroid dysfunction.  thus, we conclude that dronedarone's cytotoxic effect in breast cancer cell lines are independent of thrα or thrα1 antagonism.  dronedarone induced hyperthyroidism at the early stage and hypothyroidism at the late stage whereas amiodarone only caused hypothyroidism.  the antiproliferative and antitumor effects of dronedarone, an fda-approved anti-arrhythmic drug which has been shown to antagonize thrα1, was evaluated in breast cancer cell lines in vitro and in vivo.  in our study, dronedarone demonstrates cytotoxic effects in vitro and in vivo in breast cancer cell lines at doses and concentrations that may be clinically relevant.  however, the effects of dronedarone on lipid metabolism and of both dronedarone and amiodarone on thyroid function and lipid metabolism remain unknown.  during treatment with amiodarone and t3, plasma t3 and free t3 increased and plasma t4, free t4 and rt3 levels decreased; the frequency of vpcs remained low despite shortening of the qtc to values not different from baseline.  both serum t3 and serum t4 levels were decreased by a single 10 mg/kg delta 9-thc injection with maximal decreases at 6 hr post-injection.  in conclusion, dronedarone treatment results in cardioprotection by selectively mimicking hypothyroidism.  serum t3 levels were slightly increased by trh and this increase was also unaffected by delta 9-thc.  however, knockdown of either thrα1 or thrα did not cause substantial anti-proliferative or cytotoxic effects in vitro, nor did it alter the sensitivity to dronedarone.  dronedarone was given in wistar rats (90 mg/kg, once daily (od) for 2 weeks) (dron), while untreated animals served as controls (cont).  we found that both amiodarone and desethylamiodarone cause a decrease in intracellular t3 in all tissues (p less than 0.001), in most tissues an increase in t4 and a greater increase in the rt3 concentration.  analysis of serum th levels showed a reduction of t4 in group p (p = 0.002) at days 2 to 14, while half of the animals also displayed ""low t3"" values (p = 0.012) on day 14.  in view of their different actions on thyroid hormone receptor (tr) isoforms we set out to investigate whether amiodarone (am) and dronedarone (dron) have different and/or component-specific effects on cardiac gene expression.  hypothyroid heart displays a phenotype of cardioprotection against ischemia and this study investigated whether administration of dronedarone, an amiodarone-like compound that has been shown to preferentially antagonize thyroid hormone binding to thyroid hormone receptor alpha1 (tralpha1), results in a similar effect.  characterizing the mechanism of dronedarone's anti-tumor action may facilitate drug repurposing or the development of new anti-cancer agents.  in the present experiments, these effects of t3 on the generation of t3 from t4 were confirmed in both hemipituitaries and homogenates, indicating that they were not due to an effect of t3 on the cellular penetration of the t4 used as substrate.  in a group of 11 patients with affective disorders, tricyclic antidepressants did not alter serum t3 and t4 levels.  both compounds inhibit both deiodination (p less than 0.0001) and t3 production by the thyroid (p less than 0.0001); t4 production was enhanced (p less than 0.05). ||| ",No
Is there evidence to suggest that triiodothyronine has neuroprotective properties in traumatic brain injury?,Yes,"The context provides evidence that triiodothyronine (T3) has neuroprotective properties in traumatic brain injury (TBI). Studies have shown that T3 treatment ameliorated the progression of neurological deficits in mice subjected to TBI. Additionally, T3 has been found to possess neuroprotective and anti-edema activity in pre-stroke treatment regimens. The findings from both in vitro and in vivo studies support a role of thyroid hormone, including T3, in activating pathways important for neuronal protection and promotion of neuronal recovery after injury. Furthermore, T3 has been shown to protect against ischemic damage in the middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model of ischemic brain stroke. These studies provide evidence to stimulate clinical development of thyroid hormones, including T3, for use in ischemic brain stroke.","here we found that treatment with triiodothyronine (t3) ameliorated the progression of neurological deficits in mice subjected to tbi.  thyroid hormone plays an important role in brain development and adult brain function, and may influence neuronal recovery after traumatic brain injury (tbi).  thyroid hormone (th) plays a crucial role in neurodevelopment, but its function and specific mechanisms remain unclear after traumatic brain injury (tbi).  thyrotropin-releasing hormone (trh) and some of its stable analogues have recently been shown to improve functional recovery after neurologic dysfunctions, such as brain trauma and epilepsy, in both animals and humans.  the findings from both in vitro and in vivo studies support a role of thyroid hormone in activating pathways important for neuronal protection and promotion of neuronal recovery after injury.  however, in traumatic brain injury (tbi), it is unclear whether a beneficial effect of tetrahydrocurcumin exists.  we have previously demonstrated that thyroid hormone (t3; 3,3',5-triiodo-l-thyronine) possesses neuroprotective and anti-edema activity in pre-stroke treatment regimens when administered as a solution or as a nanoparticle formulation.  we hypothesize that a deiodinase ii (d2) inhibitor reverse triiodothyronine (rt3) may render brain specific hypometabolic state to ensue reduced damage during an acute phase of cerebral ischemia without affecting circulating thyroid hormone levels.  thyroid hormone (t3) has been shown to protect against ischemic damage in middle cerebral artery occlusion (mcao) model of ischemic brain stroke.  our studies provide evidence to stimulate clinical development of thyroid hormones for use in ischemic brain stroke.  triiodothyronine (t3), successfully used as therapeutic agent in euthyroid depressive states, has been found to exert an antidepressant-like effect in various psychopharmacological tests in rodents.  in this study, we hypothesized that administration of tetrahydrocurcumin provides neuroprotection in a rat model of tbi.  these findings reveal new roles and mechanisms of triiodothyronine in the cardioprotection against i/r injury.  in extra-hypothalamic regions in vitro, we have shown trh to have a protective effect against synaptic loss and neuronal apoptosis.  triiodothyronine (t3), the biologically active form of thyroid hormone, was reported to protect myocardium from ischemia/reperfusion (i/r) injury when given before sustained ischemia, but its cardioprotective effects when given at the onset of reperfusion (postconditioning), a protocol with more clinical impact is unknown.  recent studies have provided evidence that triiodothyronine (t3) might play an effective role in the recovery of ischemic myocardium, through the preservation of mitochondrial function and the improvement of energy substrate metabolism.  a single dose of levothyroxine (t4), one hour after injury, increased serum t4 and normalized serum t3 levels.  pre-clinical animal studies have shown that triiodothyronine (t3) replacement therapy improves cardiac contractile function after myocardial infarction (mi).  rt3 administration in rats significantly reduced neuronal injury markers, infarct size and neurological deficit upon ischemic insult.  further, we tested t2 (3,5-diiodo-l-thyronine) a natural deiodination metabolite of t3 in mcao model of brain stroke. ||| ",Yes
Are neurexins localized at pre-synapses?,Yes,"Neurexins are a diverse family of cell adhesion molecules that are primarily localized on the presynaptic membrane of CNS neurons. They are known to play an essential role in the stabilization and functional maturation of synapses, and are involved in the regulation of synapse formation and synaptic transmission. Neurexins interact with numerous cell adhesion and receptor molecules, and are known to form trans-synaptic complexes with postsynaptic neuroligins. The precise synaptic localization of neurexins remains enigmatic, but they are well-characterized as presynaptic cell adhesion molecules that shape the molecular composition of synapses.","here we report that neurexins are concentrated at synapses and that purified neuroligin is sufficient to cluster neurexin and to induce presynaptic differentiation.  neurexins are a diverse family of cell adhesion molecules that localize to presynaptic specializations of cns neurons.  these experiments suggest that neurexins are dispensable for the formation of initial synaptic contacts, but play an essential role in the stabilization and functional maturation of synapses.  neurexins are primary located on the presynaptic membrane, whereas neuroligins are strictly postsynaptic proteins.  however, the precise synaptic localization of neurexins remains enigmatic.  β-neurexins interact with numerous cell adhesion and receptor molecules, but their neuronal localization remains elusive.  moreover, we observe a large extrasynaptic pool of β-neurexins on axons and show that axonal β-neurexins diffuse with higher surface mobility than those transiently confined within synapses.  neurexins are presynaptic adhesion molecules that shape the molecular composition of synapses.  when overexpressed in nonneuronal cells, neurexins induce formation of postsynaptic specializations in cocultured neurons, suggesting that neurexins are synaptogenic.  neurexins are presynaptic adhesion molecules that organize synapses by binding to diverse trans-synaptic ligands, but how neurexins are regulated is incompletely understood.  heterologous expression of neurexins in non-neuronal cells leads to the recruitment of postsynaptic proteins in contacting dendrites of co-cultured neurons, implicating neurexins in synapse formation.  these findings suggest that the surface mobility of endogenous β-neurexins inside and outside of synapses is dynamically regulated and linked to neuronal activity.  neurexins are well-characterized presynaptic cell adhesion molecules that engage multifarious postsynaptic ligands and organize diverse synapse properties.  neurexins are presynaptic cell-adhesion molecules that form trans-synaptic complexes with postsynaptic neuroligins.  although neurexins, which are cell adhesion molecules localized predominantly to the presynaptic terminals, are known to regulate synapse formation and synaptic transmission, their roles in the regulation of synaptic vesicle release during repetitive nerve stimulation are unknown.  taken together, our results reveal an unexpected nanodomain organization of synapses in which neurexin-1 is assembled into discrete presynaptic nanoclusters that are dynamically regulated via ectodomain cleavage.  α- and β-neurexins are presynaptic cell-adhesion molecules whose general importance for synaptic transmission is well documented.  our data expand the understanding of neurexin-based transsynaptic interaction networks by providing further insight into the interactions nucleated by neurexins at the synapse.  interactions between presynaptic neurexins and postsynaptic neuroligins coordinate the formation of synaptic adhesions.  neurexins are a large family of neuronal plasma membrane proteins, which function as trans-synaptic receptors during synaptic differentiation. ||| ",Yes
Does SARM1 deletion cause neurodegeneration?,No,"SARM1 deletion does not cause neurodegeneration. In fact, SARM1 deficiency has been shown to prevent axonal degeneration and promote axon outgrowth in mice lacking NMNAT2, independently of NMNAT metabolites. This deficiency also preserves cone visual function in surviving photoreceptors when assayed by electroretinography. The activation of SARM1, however, has been linked to the destruction of NAD pools in the photoreceptor layer, contributing to cell death in photoreceptor cell degeneration. Therefore, SARM1 deletion does not cause neurodegeneration, but rather, its absence can prevent or delay the process.","sarm1 is known to mediate neuronal cell degeneration through depletion of essential metabolite nad and induction of energy crisis.  sarm1 is known for its role in axonal degeneration, but a role for sarm1 in photoreceptor cell degeneration has not been reported.  sarm1 function and nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase 2 (nmnat2) loss both promote axon degeneration, but their relative relationship in the process is unknown.  sarm1 is the central executioner of the axonal degeneration pathway that culminates in depletion of axonal nad+, yet the identity of the underlying nad+-depleting enzyme(s) is unknown.  sarm1, a protein with critical nadase activity, is a central executioner in a conserved programme of axon degeneration.  these findings of disease-associated coding variants that alter sarm1 function build on previously reported genome-wide significant association with als for a neighbouring, more common sarm1 intragenic single nucleotide polymorphism (snp) to support a contributory role of sarm1 in these disorders.  hence, the sarm1 enzyme represents a novel therapeutic target for axonopathies.  we report seven rare missense or in-frame microdeletion human sarm1 variant alleles in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (als) or other motor nerve disorders that alter the sarm1 auto-inhibitory arm domain and constitutively hyperactivate sarm1 nadase activity.  overall, our data indicate that endogenous sarm1 has the capacity to consume nad in photoreceptor cells and identifies a previously unappreciated role for sarm1-dependent cell death in photoreceptor cell degeneration.  here, we show that nmnat2 loss and resultant changes to nmnat metabolites occur in injured sarm1-deficient axons despite their delayed degeneration and that axon degeneration specifically induced by nmnat2 depletion requires sarm1.  using traumatic and vincristine-induced injury models in neurons, we demonstrate that the nadase activity of full-length sarm1 is required in axons to promote axonal nad+ depletion and axonal degeneration after injury.  strikingly, sarm1 deficiency also corrects axon outgrowth in mice lacking nmnat2, independently of nmnat metabolites, preventing perinatal lethality.  here, we bring together historical and recent experimental findings to conclude that there is a possibility that sod1 loss of function may play a modifying role in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.  dominant mutations in superoxide dismutase 1 (sod1) cause degeneration of motor neurons in a subset of inherited amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (als).  nmnat2-depletion-dependent degeneration of established axons and restricted extension of developing axons are thus both sarm1 dependent, and sarm1 acts either downstream of nmnat2 loss and nmn accumulation in a linear pathway or in a parallel branch of a convergent pathway.  finally, we demonstrate that sarm1 deficiency preserves cone visual function in the surviving photoreceptors when assayed by electroretinography.  here, we demonstrate that sarm1 is expressed in photoreceptors, and using retinal tissue explant, we confirm that activation of sarm1 causes destruction of nad pools in the photoreceptor layer.  from analysing published data from patients with sod1-amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, we find a marked loss of sod1 enzyme activity arising from almost all mutations.  mutations in the gene superoxide dismutase 1 (sod1) are causative for familial forms of the neurodegenerative disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.  mutant sod1 protein likely gains a novel cytotoxic property, leading to the death of motor neurons. ||| ",No
Is Annexin V an apoptotic marker?,Yes,"Annexin V is a calcium-dependent protein that binds with high affinity to phosphatidylserine exposed during apoptosis. It is widely used as a marker for apoptotic cells due to its ability to identify extracellular phosphatidylserine, which arises during apoptosis. Annexin V is useful in detecting apoptotic cells by binding to phosphatidylserine that is exposed on the outer surface of the cell membrane during apoptosis. Radiolabeled Annexin V has been proposed to be a promising candidate for detecting apoptotic cells in tumors following chemotherapy in vivo. Annexin V recognizes apoptotic cells by specific molecular interaction with phosphatidyl serine, a lipid that is normally sequestered in the inner leaflet of the cell membrane, but is translocated to the outer leaflet in apoptotic cells. Annexin V accumulated in the infarct area of the left ventricle, where apoptotic cells were observed. At electron microscopy, gold-labeling of Annexin V was located on the plasma membrane only of apoptotic thymocytes and on cytoplasmic debris, likely resulting from the typical apoptotic blebbing.

Could BRCA gene test used for breast and ovarian cancer risk?,Yes,"The BRCA gene test is used for assessing the risk of breast and ovarian cancer. This test identifies mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, which are associated with an increased risk of developing breast and ovarian cancers. Women with a germline pathogenic variant in these genes have a significantly higher lifetime risk of early-onset breast and ovarian cancer. The BRCA1-2 mutation is considered the most important known risk factor for ovarian cancer. The recommendation to pursue BRCA1/2 testing is based on a patient's family history of breast/ovarian cancer, age of disease-onset, and/or pathologic parameters of breast tumors. The test results can have implications for reproductive health and impact health management decisions, including imaging screening, preventive surgical interventions, and systemic therapies.","recent identification of the breast-ovarian cancer susceptibility gene brca1 and the breast cancer susceptibility gene brca2 have raised the possibility of clinical genetic testing for breast cancer susceptibility.  genetic testing enables women at risk for hereditary breast and/or ovarian cancer to find out whether they have inherited the gene mutation (brca1/brca2), and if so, to opt for frequent surveillance and/or prophylactic surgery (bilateral mastectomy and/or oophorectomy).  in women at increased risk for breast and ovarian cancer, the identification of a mutation in breast cancer gene 1 (brca1) and brca2 has important implications for screening and prevention counseling.  germline mutations in brca genes are associated with breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility.  main objective of our study was to determine the effectiveness of ovarian cancer screening in women with a brca1/2 mutation.  the discovery of brca1 and brca2 has led to a reassessment of the association between family history of breast/ovarian cancer and breast cancer risk after controlling for carrier status for mutations in the brca1 and brca2 genes.  we evaluated 241 consecutive women with a brca1 or brca2 mutation who were enrolled in the surveillance program for hereditary ovarian cancer from september 1995 until may 2006 at the university medical center groningen (umcg), the netherlands.  genetic mutations in breast cancer susceptibility genes brca1/2 are associated with an increased risk of breast/ovarian cancers.  brca mutation screening is frequently offered on the basis of the fulfillment of empirical selection criteria, thought to be indicative of a genetic predisposition to breast/ovarian cancer (brca/ovca).  brca1 and brca2 are genes that cause breast and ovarian cancer when they are inherited in families.  brca1 and brca2 testing is integral to cancer risk assessment in all high-risk women.  the recommendation to pursue brca1/2 testing is based on patient's family history of breast/ovarian cancer, age of disease-onset and/or pathologic parameters of breast tumors.  women with a germline pathogenic variant in the breast cancer susceptibility genes (brca1 or brca2) have an increased risk of early-onset breast and ovarian cancer.  the most important known risk factor for ovarian cancer is the brca1-2 mutation, which is clinically often manifested through a positive family history of cancer of the breast and/or ovary.  brca1/2 gene mutations increase risk of breast and/or ovarian cancer and may have implications for reproductive health.  patients with breast cancer who have mutations in the high penetrance genes brca1 and brca2, have an increased risk of ovarian cancer.  we aimed to identify the effects of the reproductive histories of women with the brca1/2 mutations on the clinical presentation of breast cancer.  five hundred and twenty-three breast cancer patients including 237 diagnosed ≤ 30 years of age and 286 with a family history of breast/ovarian cancer were screened for brca1/2 small-range mutations and large genomic rearrangements.  women harboring brca1/2 germline mutations have high lifetime risk of developing breast/ovarian cancer.  possession of a brca1/2 mutation increases risk of contralateral breast and ovarian cancer recurrence and may have an impact on health management decisions, such as imaging screening, preventive surgical interventions and systemic therapies. ||| ",Yes
Could the Menzerath-Altmann law be proved mathematically trivial in genomes?,No,".

     The Menzerath-Altmann law, which states that the mean size of the constituents of an entity is inversely related to the number of these constituents, has been shown to be applicable to genomes. However, the view of this law as inevitable is seriously flawed. The assumption that the presence of the law in genomes is an inevitable consequence of the fact that z=y/x, which would imply that z scales with x as z ∼ 1/x, is shown to be unrealistic from the perspective of chromosome structure and the statistical analysis of real genomes. The central assumption of the model, namely that genome size is independent from chromosome number, has been reviewed. The law is found to be restricted to a particular subset of genes that are formed by exons under low or intermediate sequence constraints and have a small number of alternative transcripts. Therefore, the Menzerath-Altmann law cannot be proved mathematically trivial in genomes.","the random breakage and variants keeping genome size and chromosome number independent raise no serious objection to the relevance of correlations consistent with menzerath-altmann law across taxonomic groups and the possibility of a connection between human language and genomes through that law.  based on this observation we propose a hypothesis for the law of menzerath-altmann in mammalian genes being predominantly due to genes that are more versatile in function and thus, more prone to undergo changes in their structure.  to this end we demonstrate one test case where gene categories of different functionality also show differences in the extent of conformity to menzerath-altmann law.  that scaling is a very particular case of menzerath-altmann law that has been rejected by means of a correlation test between x and y in genomes, being x the number of chromosomes of a species, y its genome size in bases and z the mean chromosome size.  recently, a random breakage model has been proposed to explain the negative correlation between mean chromosome length and chromosome number that is found in many groups of species and is consistent with menzerath-altmann law, a statistical law that defines the dependency between the mean size of the whole and the number of parts in quantitative linguistics.  exon sizes and exon numbers in genes have been shown to conform to a law derived from statistical linguistics and formulated by menzerath and altmann, according to which the mean size of the constituents of an entity is inversely related to the number of these constituents.  menzerath's law, the tendency of z (the mean size of the parts) to decrease as x (the number of parts) increases, is found in language, music and genomes.  the view of menzerath-altmann law as inevitable is seriously flawed.  here we review the statistical foundations of that test and consider three non-parametric tests based upon different correlation metrics and one parametric test to evaluate if z ∼ 1/x in genomes.  we show that extensive linear fits, representative of accordance to menzerath-altmann law are restricted to a particular subset of genes that are formed by exons under low or intermediate sequence constraints and have a small number of alternative transcripts.  recently, it has been argued that the presence of the law in genomes is an inevitable consequence of the fact that z=y/x, which would imply that z scales with x as z ∼ 1/x.  this assumption is shown to be unrealistic from the perspective of chromosome structure and the statistical analysis of real genomes.  here, the central assumption of the model, namely that genome size is independent from chromosome number is reviewed.  quite unexpectedly, kinetic theory is found to specify the correct definition of average value to be employed in nonextensive statistical mechanics.  it has also been indicated that darwin's influence on mendel, primarily from the origin, is evident.  although mendel is now widely recognized as the founder of genetics, historical studies have shown that he did not in fact propose the modern concept of paired characters linked to genes, nor did he formulate the two ""mendelian laws"" in the form now given.  we calculate explicitly how the macroscopic quantities (i.e., quantities that depend on the quantitative trait) depend on evolutionary forces, in a way that is independent of the microscopic details.  i argue that neither mendel understood the evolutionary significance of his findings for the problem of genetic variation, nor would darwin have understood their significance had he read mendel's paper.  we present a modified version of that approach, which makes the analogy more precise and applies quite generally to describe the evolution of allele frequencies.  i present a brief review of these criticisms and conclude that mendel deserved to be called the father of genetics even if he may not, and most likely did not, have clear ideas of segregation and particulate determiners as we know them now. ||| ",Yes
Have 5q35 microdeletions been implicated in Sotos syndrome development?,Yes,"The context indicates that 5q35 microdeletions have been implicated in the development of Sotos syndrome. Haploinsufficiency of the human 5q35 region spanning the nsd1 gene results in a rare genomic disorder known as Sotos syndrome.

Furthermore, the context reports eight cases of 5q35 deletions and one patient with an intragenic nsd1 mutation with transient hi. These findings suggest that 5q35 microdeletions have been implicated in Sotos syndrome development.","patients with sotos syndrome show 5q35 deletions involving nsd1 or its point mutations.  haploinsufficiency of the human 5q35 region spanning the nsd1 gene results in a rare genomic disorder known as sotos syndrome (sotos), with patients displaying a variety of clinical features, including pre- and postnatal overgrowth, intellectual disability, and urinary/renal abnormalities.  we identified the common 5q35 deletion in a patient with atypical sotos syndrome manifesting extremely severe developmental delay, joint hypermobility, and skin hyperextensibility, which are recognized as marfanoid hypermobility syndrome.  haploinsufficiency of the nuclear receptor set domain-containing protein 1 (nsd1) gene located on 5q35 has been implicated as the cause of sotos syndrome.  loss-of-function mutations of nsd1 and 5q35 microdeletions encompassing nsd1 are a major cause of sotos syndrome (sos), which is characterized by overgrowth, macrocephaly, characteristic facies, and variable intellectual disability (id).  sotos syndrome is a well-known overgrowth syndrome caused by haploinsufficiency of nsd1 gene located at 5q35.  cytogenetic studies were performed to confirm 5q35 microdeletion, and nsd1 sequencing analysis was performed to identify intragenic mutations.  sotos syndrome, which is characterized by overgrowth, macrocephaly, distinctive facial features, and developmental delay, arises from mutations and deletions of the nsd1 gene at 5q35.3.  sotos syndrome is an overgrowth syndrome characterized by macrocephaly, advanced bone age, characteristic facial features, and learning disabilities, caused by mutations or deletions of the nsd1 gene, located at 5q35.  eight cases of 5q35 deletions and one patient with an intragenic nsd1 mutation with transient hi have been reported.  our findings suggest that sotos syndrome is a rare cause of autism spectrum disorders and that screening for nsd1 mutations and deletions in patients with autism and macrocephaly is not warranted in the absence of other features of sotos syndrome.  prior genomic studies have suggested that haploinsufficiency of multiple 5q31.2 genes may contribute to mds pathogenesis.  we investigated detailed craniofacial, dental, and oral findings in five patients with deletion type, and three patients with mutation type sotos syndrome.  specifically, the interstitial deletion of chromosome 5q33.3q35.1, an extremely rare chromosomal aberration, is characterized by mental retardation, developmental delay, and facial dysmorphism.  chromosomal microarray analysis using the comparative genomic hybridization array method revealed a 16-mb-long deletion of 5q33.  these patients with persistent hi and sotos syndrome caused by nsd1 mutations, further dispel the hypothesis that hi is due to the deletion of other genes in the deleted 5q35 region.  severe mental retardation has been described in most patients who present 5q deletions.  constitutional interstitial deletions of the long arm of chromosome 5 (5q) are quite rare, and the corresponding phenotype is not yet clearly delineated.  sotos syndrome has been described in a number of patients with autism spectrum disorders, suggesting that nsd1 could be involved in other cases of autism and macrocephaly.  here, we report a case of a de novo deletion of 5q33.3q35.1, 46,xy,del(5)(q33.3q35.1) in an 11-year-old boy with mental retardation; to the best of our knowledge this is the first case in korea to be reported. ||| ",Yes
Are patients with Sjogren syndrome at increased risk for lymphoma?,Yes,"Patients with Sjögren's syndrome (SS) have a well-recognized and significantly increased risk of developing malignant lymphoma, particularly non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL).

Primary Sjögren's syndrome (PSS) is associated with an increased risk of lymphoproliferative malignancy, and PSS is complicated by B-cell lymphoma in 5-10% of patients. The frequent association of SS with NHL provides an opportunity to study the pathogenetic steps of lymphomagenesis. The increased risk of developing lymphoma in SS patients is an example of the interplay of systemic autoimmunity and lymphoproliferative diseases.","patients with sjögren's syndrome (ss) have a considerable higher risk of lymphoma development.  patients with sjögren's syndrome (ss) have an increased risk of developing malignant lymphoma.  an increased risk of developing lymphoma has been indicated in sjögren's syndrome (ss), and the lymphomas in ss are usually b-cell type in origin.  sjögren's syndrome is an autoimmune disorder in which patients have a well-recognized risk of developing malignant lymphoma.  sjogren's syndrome (ss) is characterized by an increased risk of developing non-hodgkin's lymphoma (nhl).  sjögren's syndrome (ss) is characterized by an increased risk of developing a non-hodgkin's lymphoma (nhl).  primary sjögren's syndrome (pss) is associated with increased risk of lymphoproliferative malignancy, and b-cell non-hodgkin lymphoma (b-nhl) is the most frequent type.  it has been recognized that primary sjogren's syndrome predisposes to the development of lymphoproliferative disorders.  primary sjogren's syndrome (pss) is complicated by b-cell lymphoma in 5-10% of patients.  patients with primary sjögren's syndrome (pss) are at a higher risk of developing non-hodgkin's lymphoma (nhl).  the frequent association of sjögren's syndrome (ss) with non-hodgkin's b cell lymphoma (nhl) provides an example of the interplay of systemic autoimmunity and lymphoproliferative diseases, and an opportunity to study the pathogenetic steps of lymphomagenesis.  the purpose of the study was to detect cases of sjögren's syndrome among newly diagnosed untreated patients with non-hodgkin's lymphoma and, furthermore, to identify in such cases clinical and serologic features known to occur more frequently in sjögren's syndrome patients who evolve into lymphoma.  patients with primary sjögren's syndrome (pss) have an increased risk of developing non-hodgkin's lymphoma (nhl), particularly parotid gland mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (malt) lymphomas.  patients with sjögren's syndrome (ss) have an increased risk of developing monoclonal b cell non-hodgkin's lymphomas (mnhl), which frequently occur in the salivary glands (sg).  sjogren's syndrome was commonly identified in the patients with t-cell lgl leukemia in this study.  these results suggest that monoclonal immunoglobulin heavy chain gene rearrangements are a relatively common finding in patients with sjögren's syndrome and may prove to be a useful marker for predicting the progression to, and early detection of malignant lymphoma.  herein we report two cases of primary sjogren's syndrome complicated by breast and lung cancer and who have a strong family history for lymphoproliferative diseases.  primary sjögren's syndrome (pss) is a chronic systemic autoimmune disease with an elevated risk of developing lymphoproliferative malignancies (lm).  we set to determine the prevalence of sjogren's syndrome in lgl leukemia and its cytokine profile.  although our sample is relatively small, our results confirm the relationship between sjögren's syndrome and non-hodgkin's lymphoma, looked at from the opposite direction. ||| ",Yes
Can beans induce apoptosis?,Yes,"The context suggests that phenolics in common beans, specifically black beans and navy beans, have been found to modulate 28 proteins related to apoptotic processes. This was demonstrated through a study using a cellular model with HT-29 cells. Furthermore, the practical applications of polyphenols in common beans cultivars processed by canning indicate their chemoprotective potential as they activate mechanisms involved in apoptosis pathways. The study on rats also concluded that eating black beans and navy beans significantly lowered colon cancer incidence and multiplicity. The bioactive components in beans, such as flavonoids and saponins, have been widely studied due to their bioactivity, including their role in inducing apoptosis. Therefore, it can be inferred that beans can induce apoptosis.","phenolics in common beans modulate 28 proteins related to apoptotic processes.  two varieties of common beans (phaseolus vulgaris l.), bayo victoria and negro 8025, were evaluated to determine the effect on cellular viability and mechanisms involved in apoptosis pathways, using a cellular model with ht-29 cells.  practical applications: polyphenols in common beans (phaseolus vulgaris l.) cultivars processed by canning display chemoprotective potential as they activate mechanisms involved in apoptosis pathways.  the objective of this study was to determine whether consumption of black beans and/or navy beans would reduce colon carcinogenesis in rats.  it was concluded that eating black beans and navy beans significantly lowered colon cancer incidence and multiplicity.  beans (phaseolus vulgaris) contain bioactive components with functional properties that may modify cardiovascular risk.  proteins related to the arrest of cell cycle were modulated by both bean cultivars.  there is limited evidence to suggest an inverse relationship between bean consumption and colon cancer.  beans (phaseolus vulgaris) are an important food staple in many traditional diets.  this research evaluated the effect of germination of black beans (phaseolus vulgaris l.) on the antioxidant capacity and antiproliferative activity against cancer cell lines of saponins and flavonoids extracted from seed coats, cotyledons and sprouts.  rats were fed a modified ain-93g diet (control) or diets containing 75% black beans or 75% navy beans for 4 wk, and then colon cancer was initiated by administration of two injections of azoxymethane 1 wk apart.  diets containing beans have been associated with a lower risk of obesity and overweight in several dietary surveys.  these results suggest that both the soluble and the insoluble fraction of the extract contribute to the cancer-protective effect of cooked navy beans.  therefore, a diet including canned beans (particularly darker varieties) might represent health benefits and cancer-preventive effects.  there was greater vasorelaxation 6 h following consumption of darker-coloured beans, as shown by decreased vascular tone: pwv was lower after consuming black bean compared to pinto bean, augmentation pressure was lower after consuming black bean compared to rice and pinto bean, and wave reflection magnitude was lower after consuming red kidney bean and black bean compared to rice, navy bean, and pinto bean (p < 0.05).  the 44-75% reduction in colon carcinogenesis in rats fed beans was attributed to 1) more controlled appetites, leading to significantly less body fat, and 2) much greater concentrations of butyrate in the distal colon.  based on the protective effects of cooked dry bean consumption in a human intervention study, we evaluated which fraction of cooked dry beans is responsible for its cancer-preventive effects.  cafestol-induced apoptosis is associated with the reduction of mitochondrial membrane potential (mmp), activation of caspase 3, cytochrome c release, and down-regulation of anti-apoptotic proteins (bcl-2, bcl-xl, mcl-1 and cflip).  flavonoids and saponins from common beans have been widely studied due to their bioactivity.  cafestol-induced apoptosis was blocked by pretreatment with broad caspase inhibitor z-vad-fmk, showing its dependence on caspases. ||| ",Yes
Is vortioxetine effective for treatment of depression?,Yes,"Vortioxetine is a novel antidepressant that has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). Clinical studies have demonstrated its efficacy in improving depressive and cognitive symptoms associated with MDD. Vortioxetine has been shown to function as an antidepressant by acting as a potent antagonist of the 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor and serotonin transporter. It has also been reported to improve cognitive function, including executive function, in depressed patients in randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials. Furthermore, vortioxetine has been shown to have beneficial effects on aspects of cognitive dysfunction in depressed patients.

Is Rheumatoid Arthritis related to myopathy?,Yes,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an inflammatory autoimmune disease that affects not only the joints but also other tissues, including skeletal muscles. The chronic inflammation associated with RA is known to cause disturbances in muscle and bone metabolism, leading to muscle impairments that contribute to disability and cardiometabolic disease in RA patients. The overlapping forms of myositis, when the patient also meets the criteria for RA, affect 3%-5% of myositis patients. The usual clinical presentation of inflammatory myopathy associated with connective tissue disease is not different from isolated polymyositis or dermatomyositis. In numerous cases, the intensification of inflammatory lesions resembles changes seen in arthritis, particularly in RA, which inhibits the differential diagnosis by means of imaging examinations. Therefore, it can be concluded that RA is related to myopathy.","rheumatoid myositis (rm) is still poorly characterized, albeit the concept of muscle involvement in rheumatoid arthritis (ra) is well-recognized as being driven by a wide range of causes including inflammation, drugs, impaired joint flexibility, sedentarism.  the overlapping forms of myositis, when the patient also meets the criteria for rheumatoid arthritis (ra), affect 3%-5% of myositis patients .  rheumatoid arthritis (ra) is a disease of unknown etiology that causes irreversible joint destruction and has been known to present with not only various extra-articular symptoms, but also various autoimmune disorders.  rheumatoid arthritis (ra) is an inflammatory autoimmune disease of unknown etiology, affecting mainly the joint but also other tissues.  chronic inflammation of rheumatoid arthritis (ra) is associated with disturbances in muscle and bone metabolism.  these muscle impairments contribute to disability and cardiometabolic disease in rheumatoid arthritis.  prospective study on 23 consecutive rheumatoid arthritis (ra) with muscle involvement as defined by clinical, biological and imagistic parameters.  osteoarthritis is the most common rheumatoid disease.  rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disorder of unknown aetiology.  in rheumatoid arthritis, chronic inflammation, physical inactivity, and medication toxicities impair skeletal muscle.  rheumatoid arthritis skeletal muscle disease in the current era is defined by impaired contractile function (poor strength and endurance) and sarcopenic obesity (decreased muscle mass, increased fat mass, and intramuscular adiposity).  the usual clinical presentation of inflammatory myopathy associated with connective tissue disease is not different from isolated polymyositis or dermatomyositis, i.e., subacute onset of proximal weakness affecting both upper and lower girdle with high serum ck level.  here we report a patient with mctd/myositis overlap syndrome displaying an uncommon clinical presentation and a distribution of muscle weakness involving facial, neck and arm muscles with sparing of lower limbs.  here, we describe a case of mmf which is associated with rheumatoid arthritis.  these skeletal muscle alterations contribute to continued rheumatoid arthritis disparities in physical function and cardiometabolic health.  idiopathic inflammatory myopathies, mainly polymyositis (pm) may occur in the course of several autoimmune diseases.  mostly this is myositis in the context of a connective tissue disease with associated features such as raynaud's phenomenon, arthralgias, pulmonary fibrosis or scleroderma.  in numerous cases, the intensification of inflammatory lesions resembles changes seen in arthritis, particularly in rheumatoid arthritis, which inhibits the differential diagnosis by means of imaging examinations.  the purpose of this study was to investigate whether endocrine regulators of myogenesis and bone metabolism in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (ra) in remission differed from unaffected healthy controls.  the synovitis is probably responsible for the musculoskeletal symptoms in pmr. ||| ",Yes
Are CTCF and BORIS involved in genome regulation and cancer?,Yes,"CTCF and BORIS are indeed involved in genome regulation and cancer. CTCF, a chromatin regulator, and its paralogous protein BORIS, both play significant roles in organizing higher-order chromatin architecture. CTCF has been shown to possess tumor-suppressive properties, while BORIS, a member of the cancer-testis antigen family, is normally expressed only in germ cells but is aberrantly activated in a variety of tumors. Both CTCF and BORIS can bind to the same promoter sequence and recruit diverse proteins. The role of BORIS in promoting regulatory chromatin interactions that support specific cancer phenotypes has been identified. Furthermore, BORIS is involved in the regulation of cancer stem cell features such as self-renewal, chemo-resistance, tumorigenicity, and migration capacity. BORIS also plays a role in regulating important signaling pathways including Wnt/β-catenin and Notch in cancer stem cells.","boris (ctcfl) is a dna binding protein which is involved in tumorigenesis.  boris, a paralogue of the transcription factor ctcf, is a member of the cancer-testis antigen (ct) family.  these findings provide further evidence that ctcf behaves as a tumor suppressor, and show boris has a similar growth inhibitory effect in vitro and in vivo.  here, we have deciphered the role of boris on tgfβ1 pathway which is highly affected by embryonic ctcfl expression.  the chromatin regulator ctcf, its cofactor chd8, and antagonistic paralogue boris have wide-ranging effects on gene regulation.  boris and ctcf are paralogous, multivalent 11-zinc finger transcription factors that play important roles in organizing higher-order chromatin architecture.  these results identify a previously unrecognized role of boris-to promote regulatory chromatin interactions that support specific cancer phenotypes.  in tumorigenesis, the role of boris in the expression induction of some ct genes and oncogenes, as well as increasing proliferation/viability of cancer cells has been demonstrated in many researches.  boris, or ctcfl, the so called brother of the regulator of imprinted sites because of the extensive homology in the central dna binding region of the protein to the related regulator, ctcf, is expressed in early gametogenesis and in multiple cancers but not in differentiated somatic cells.  boris/ctcfl, a paralog of ctcf and member of the cancer-testicular antigen family, is abnormally activated in multiple cancers.  both ctcf and boris can bind to the same promoter sequence and recruit diverse proteins.  boris is a paralog of a highly conserved, multi-functional chromatin factor ctcf.  unlike ctcf, which has been shown to possess tumor-suppressive properties, boris belongs to the ""cancer/testis antigen"" family normally expressed only in germ cells and aberrantly activated in a variety of tumors.  in this study, we characterized the entire promoter region of boris/ctcfl, including the cpg islands, to assess the relationship between boris expression and lung cancer.  boris is involved in the regulation of csc cellular and molecular features such as self-renewal, chemo-resistance, tumorigenicity, sphere-forming ability, and migration capacity.  finally, the role of boris in regulating two important signaling pathways including wnt/β-catenin and notch in cscs, and its ability in recruiting transcription factors or chromatin-remodeling proteins to induce tumorigenesis is discussed.  ctcf-like, or boris, is thought to antagonise ctcf and has been found in normal testis, ovary and a large variety of tumour cells.  the cancer-testis antigen ctcfl/boris (brother of regulator of imprinted sites) also known, as a paralog of ctcf -the ""master weaver of the genome"" is a key transcriptional regulator.  by contrast, the germ-cell-specific paralogue of ctcf, boris (brother of the regulator of imprinted sites, also known as ctcfl)6, is overexpressed in several cancers7-9, but its contributions to the malignant phenotype remain unclear.  expression of the cancer-germline (cg) (or cancer-testis) antigen gene boris/ctcfl has been proposed to mediate activation of cg antigen genes in cancer. ||| ",Yes
Has the proteome of mice hippocampus been analysed?,Yes,"The proteome of the mouse hippocampus has indeed been analyzed using various techniques, including two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) coupled with mass spectrometry. This approach has been used to determine strain-dependent levels of metabolic proteins in the hippocampal tissue of four inbred and one outbred mouse strain. Additionally, the temporal changes of the mouse hippocampal synaptic membrane proteome have been studied 1 and 4 hours after contextual fear learning. Furthermore, a 9,000 gene microarray has been used to examine differences in hippocampal gene expression between different mouse strains. These studies have provided valuable insights into the molecular underpinnings and genetic determination of strain-dependent neuronal function in the hippocampus.","molecules that govern the formation, integrity, and function of the hippocampus remain an important area of investigation.  a proteomic approach based on two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-de) coupled with mass spectrometry  has been chosen to address this question by determining strain-dependent levels of metabolic proteins in hippocampal tissue of four inbred and one outbred mouse strain.  here, we accurately quantitatively studied the hippocampal microstructure changes in alzheimer's disease model mice and analyzed the relationship between the hippocampal microstructure changes and learning and memory.  strain-specific variation of metabolic protein levels in the hippocampus among various commonly used mouse strains, however, has not been investigated yet.  electrophysiological recordings of synaptic responses were made using hippocampal slices prepared from mice whose behaviour had been analysed.  here, we analyzed the temporal changes of the mouse hippocampal synaptic membrane proteome 1 and 4 h after contextual fear learning, comparing two groups; (1) a fear memory forming ""delayed-shock"" group and (2) a fear memory-deficient ""immediate-shock"" group.  the mouse brain has been subjected to intensive scrutiny in this regard; however, a multitude of studies has examined synaptic plasticity in the hippocampal slice preparation, whereas very few have addressed synaptic plasticity in the freely behaving mouse.  although this mouse shows abnormalities in cognitive function that implicate hippocampus as well as marked deficits in hippocampal long-term potentiation, the structure of the hippocampus has been little studied.  furthermore, data presented herein emphasize the significance of the genetic background for the analysis of metabolic pathways in the hippocampus in wild-type mice as well as in gene-targeting experiments.  we have investigated synaptic function in the hippocampus in mice of different ages carrying a null mutation in the prp gene.  the hippocampus has long been implicated in memory formation.  although accumulating evidence suggests involvement of the hippocampus in other brain functions including locomotor regulation and emotional processes, cellular and synaptic bases underlying these functions remain largely unknown.  thus, automated and efficient hippocampal-sensitive cognitive tests for the mouse are important for developing therapeutic targets for these diseases, and understanding brain-behaviour relationships.  here we show that absence of the proneuropeptide processing enzyme, carboxypeptidase e (cpe) in cpe knock-out (ko) mice had a profound effect on memory, synaptic physiology, and the cytoarchitecture of the hippocampus in these animals.  strain-specific protein levels of metabolic proteins in the mouse hippocampus may provide some insight into the molecular underpinnings and genetic determination of strain-dependent neuronal function.  we used a 9,000 gene microarray to examine differences in hippocampal gene expression between two f1 hybrid mouse strains that perform well on the morris water maze and two inbred strains that perform poorly.  the importance of the hippocampus to learning and memory has attracted significant attention to how the structure responds to damage.  the hippocampus is implicated in many of the cognitive impairments observed in conditions such as alzheimer's disease (ad) and schizophrenia (scz).  the role of the hippocampus in non-spatial memory has been issue of some controversy.  lesion and pharmacological intervention studies have suggested that in both human patients and animals the hippocampus plays a crucial role in the rapid acquisition and storage of information from a novel one-time experience. ||| ",Yes

Have thyronamines  effects on fat tissue?,No,"The context does not provide information on the effects of thyronamines on fat tissue. The context primarily discusses the role of thyroid hormones, particularly triiodothyronine (T3) and thyrotropin (TSH), in modulating adipose tissue differentiation and metabolism. It also mentions the presence of TSH receptors in adipose tissue and their potential role in adipose differentiation. However, there is no mention of thyronamines, which are a class of endogenous compounds derived from thyroid hormones, and their effects on fat tissue. Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine whether thyronamines have effects on fat tissue.","differentiation and metabolism of adipose tissue are modulated by thyroid hormones (ths), but relatively little is known about the metabolism of ths in this tissue.  increased lipid mobilization in thyrotoxicosis is attributed to amplification of catecholamine action in fat cells by thyroid hormones.  thyrotropin receptor (tshr) in extrathyroidal tissue, especially fat tissue, is supposed to have important roles in the development of extrathyroidal manifestations of graves' disease.  although tsh is the main regulator of thyroid growth and function, tsh binding activity in fat has long been reported.  our results document increased d1 gene expression and activity in adipose tissue of obese humans and suggest a role of 3,5,3'-triiodo-l-thyronine formed by d1 in response to leptin in the modulation of adipose tissue metabolism.  this study aimed to explore the relationship between abdominal fat distribution and free triiodothyronine (ft3) and ft3 to free thyroxine (ft4) ratio (ft3/ft4) in a euthyroid population.  in adipose tissue, changes in thyroid status result in alterations of lipolytic capacity.  in both subcutaneous and visceral fat, the thyroid gene expression (especially tshr) is reduced in obesity.  however, while it is unclear what the effects are of calorie restriction and high doses of triiodothyronine (t(3)) on adipokines in obesity, thyroid hormones are illicitly administered in isolation or in association with a hypocaloric diet as an obesity treatment.  thyroid hormones regulate energy balance and act on adipokines.  since the tsh receptor (tshr) has been detected in both preadipocytes and adipocytes, we hypothesized that it may play a role in adipose differentiation.  thyrotropin receptor (tsh-r) has been thought to be thyroid-specific, but, by northern blot analysis, we found that rat adipose tissue expressed tsh-r mrnas in amounts approaching those in the thyroid.  to investigate the influence of thyroid hormone status on adipose tshr expression, we induced hyper- and hypothyroidism in balbc mice by administering tri-iodothyronine and propylthiouracil respectively.  the objective of this study was to measure the expression of the tsh receptor (tshr) and the thyroid hormone receptor (tralpha1) genes in subcutaneous adipose tissue (sat) and visceral adipose tissue (vat) in obese individuals and to test the effect of weight loss on these genes.  in the present study, we investigated the effect of triiodothyronine (t3) on the expression of adiponectin mrna and the release of leptin and adiponectin by white adipose tissue (wat) explants obtained from epididymal (visceral) or inguinal (subcutaneous) depots from normal rats.  to determine whether tsh impacts adipogenesis, we examined how adipocytes responded to tsh at various points during their differentiation from cultured es cells.  thyroid hormones are key regulators of metabolism.  although thyroid hormones influence adipocyte metabolism, nt3bs have not been described in mature adipocytes yet.  the reversal of these changes with major weight loss and the reciprocal changes in plasma tsh and ft(3) levels suggest a role for adipocytes in the regulation of tsh and thyroid hormones.  this study examined whether tsh has direct effects on peripheral th metabolism and serum lipids. ||| ",No
Is Growth factor independence 1b (GFI1B) important for hematopoiesis?,Yes,"Growth factor independence 1b (GFI1B) is a zinc finger transcription factor that is essential for the development and differentiation of erythroid and megakaryocytic lineages. It is a key regulator of hematopoietic stem cell homeostasis and is required for erythroid and megakaryocytic differentiation. GFI1B coordinates the assembly of transcriptional repressor complexes, which control gene expression programs governing lineage allocation in hematopoiesis. The expression of GFI1B is restricted to erythroid lineage cells and is essential for erythropoiesis. GFI1B has been found to be overexpressed in leukemic patients and cell lines, and its expression is increased in patients with erythroleukaemia and megakaryocytic leukaemia. Together, these findings establish GFI1B as a master transcriptional repressor of adult erythropoiesis and thrombopoiesis.","growth factor‑independent 1 (gfi1) has been reported to serve a vital role in hematopoietic development.  growth factor independence 1b (gfi1b) is a dna binding repressor of transcription with vital functions in hematopoiesis.  growth factor independence 1 (gfi1) is important for maturation of mammalian lymphocytes and neutrophils and maintenance of adult hematopoietic stem cells (hscs).  growth factor independence 1 (gfi1), a transcriptional repressor, is required for hematopoietic stem cell maintenance and self-renewal in addition to controlling differentiation and proliferation of myeloid cells.  the role of gfi1 in embryonic hematopoiesis is less well characterized.  the growth factor independence 1 (gfi1) gene was originally discovered in the hematopoietic system, where it functions as a key regulator of stem cell homeostasis, as well as neutrophil and t-cell development.  growth factor-independent 1b (gfi1b) is a transcription factor essential for the development and differentiation of erythroid and megakaryocytic lineages.  this is the case for the growth factor independent 1b (gfi1b) transcription factor, which is required for erythroid and megakaryocytic differentiation and over-expressed in leukemic patients and cell lines.  gfi1 plays important roles in hematopoiesis, in particular by regulating both the function of hematopoietic stem- and precursor cells and differentiation along myeloid and lymphoid lineages.  gfi-1b (growth factor independence-1b) gene is an erythroid-specific transcription factor, whose expression plays an essential role in erythropoiesis.  our data indicate that gfi-1b signalling is important for commitment and maturation of hematopoietic cell populations.  growth factor-independence 1b (gfi1b) is a zinc finger transcription factor essential for erythroid and megakaryocytic development.  to investigate the molecular effects of growth factor independence 1b (gfi-1b), a transcription factor essential for the development of hematopoietic cells and differentiation of erythroid and megakaryocytic lineages, the naturally gfi-1b overexpressing cell line k562 was cultured in the presence of gfi-1b target-specific small interfering rna (sirna).  gfi1b (growth factor independence 1b) is a zinc finger transcription factor essential for development of the erythroid and megakaryocytic lineages.  growth factor independence 1b (gfi1b) coordinates assembly of transcriptional repressor complexes comprised of corepressors and histone-modifying enzymes to control gene expression programs governing lineage allocation in hematopoiesis.  the growth factor independent 1 (gfi1) transcriptional regulator oncoprotein plays a crucial role in hematopoietic, inner ear, and pulmonary neuroendocrine cell development and governs cell processes as diverse as self-renewal of hematopoietic stem cells, proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation, cell fate specification, and oncogenesis.  expression of gfi (growth factor-independence)-1b, a gfi-1-related transcriptional repressor, is restricted to erythroid lineage cells and is essential for erythropoiesis.  it is known that insulin-like growth factor-1 (igf-1) also functions as a hematopoietic factor, although its direct effect on thrombopoiesis remains unclear.  together our study establishes gfi-1b as a master transcriptional repressor of adult erythropoiesis and thrombopoiesis.  gfi1b expression was increased at least threefold in patients with erythroleukaemia (p < 0.01 compared with controls) and megakaryocytic leukaemia (p < 0.05) as well as in their corresponding leukaemic cell lines hel, k562, cmk and m-07e. ||| ",Yes
Are integrins part of the extracellular matrix?,No,"Integrins are not part of the extracellular matrix (ECM) but are transmembrane receptors that mediate the interactions between cells and the ECM. They are heterodimeric glycoproteins, composed of alpha and beta subunits, which bind to various ECM components such as laminin, fibronectin, vitronectin, and collagen. Integrins are expressed on almost every cell type and play a crucial role in linking the ECM to the cytoskeleton, thus regulating multiple cellular processes including adhesion, migration, proliferation, and growth factor-dependent signaling. The specificity of integrin-ligand binding is determined by the distinct extracellular domains of the integrin molecule, which interact with amino acid motifs in the ECM ligands.","integrins are the principal receptors for extracellular matrix.  integrins are heterodimeric glycoproteins acting as membrane receptors for extracellular matrix components.  integrins are found in adhesion structures, which link the extracellular matrix to cytoskeletal proteins.  integrins are expressed on almost every cell type and are responsible for the linkage of the extracellular matrix with the cytoskeleton.  integrins are cell surface receptors that mediate the physical and functional interactions between a cell and its surrounding extracellular matrix (ecm).  integrins are a complex family of non-covalently linked heterodimeric glycoproteins which function as cell adhesion molecules, interacting with extracellular matrix molecules such as laminin, fibronectin, vitronectin, and collagen, and also having a role in intercellular adhesion.  although integrins are known to mediate adhesive binding of cells to the extracellular matrix, their role in mediating cellular growth, morphology, and differentiation is less clear.  integrins, the major receptors for cell-extracellular matrix (ecm) interactions, regulate multiple cell biological processes including adhesion, migration, proliferation and growth factor-dependent signaling.  in vivo, ligands for integrins are immobilized within extracellular matrices, insoluble sheet-like or fibrous supramolecular complexes that associate with or surround cells.  in vivo, ligands for integrins are immobilized within extracellular matrices, insoluble sheet-like or fibrous supramolecular complexes that associate with or surround cells.  integrins are the prototypic heterodimeric transmembrane matrix receptors with competing affinities for individual extracellular matrix ligands.  this article focuses on integrin α6β4 as a paradigm to illustrate the importance as well as the complexity of integrins in the mediation of cell-matrix interactions.  specific integrin heterodimers preferentially bind to distinct extracellular matrix (ecm) proteins to affect the characteristics of cells or the components of the ecm.  integrins bind to their ligand in the extracellular matrix (ecm), such as fibronectin (fn), through a specific interaction between the amino acid motifs in the ligand, and binding sites in the extracellular domains of the integrin molecule generated jointly by its alpha and beta subunits.  the alpha4beta1 integrin exhibits a distinct distribution from other beta1 integrins after cells have adhered for 1 h to extracellular matrix proteins but is localized in adhesion structures after 24 h of adhesion.  integrin-linked kinase organizes the connections of the extracellular matrix via integrins to the cytoskeleton and is involved in adhesion plaque signalling.  these cell-matrix interactions are thought to be mediated largely through a family of cell surface receptors termed integrins.  αvβ3 integrin can bind to multiple extracellular matrix proteins, including vitronectin (vn) and fibronectin (fn), which are often presented to cells in culture as homogenous substrates.  here, we attempt to further define the distribution of beta1 integrins in the context of their association with matrix proteins and other cell surface molecules relevant to the endocytic process.  cells are capable of adhering to and migrating on protein components of the extracellular matrix. ||| ",Yes
Is recursive splicing more common in short introns?,No,"The context suggests that recursive splicing is a process observed in both Drosophila and humans, where large introns are removed in multiple steps by re-splicing at ratchet points. The process of recursive splicing has been observed in a small subset of Drosophila melanogaster introns, and it is generally believed that splicing removes introns as single units from precursor messenger RNA transcripts. The context also mentions that short introns are abundant in the human transcriptome and that short intron splicing represents an added layer to mRNA regulation. However, the context does not provide evidence that recursive splicing is more common in short introns. In fact, the context suggests that recursive splicing is a process used to remove large introns, not short introns.","short intron splicing efficiency is increased by secondary structure, and we detect both canonical and non-canonical short introns.  together, these results indicate that recursive splicing is commonly used in drosophila, occurs in humans, and provides insight into the mechanisms by which some large introns are removed.  suggesting a possible function for recursive splicing, we observe that fly introns with recursive sites are spliced more accurately than comparably sized non-recursive introns.  the sequential nature of recursive splicing was confirmed by identification of lariat introns generated by splicing to and from the ratchet points.  recursive splicing, a process by which a single intron is removed from pre-mrna transcripts in multiple distinct segments, has been observed in a small subset of drosophila melanogaster introns.  recursive splicing is a process in which large introns are removed in multiple steps by re-splicing at ratchet points--5' splice sites recreated after splicing.  it has been proposed that, although sequences involved in intron recognition and splicing are mainly located in introns, exonic sequences also contribute to intron splicing.  the splicing pathway of pre-mrna introns bears similarities to that of the group ii introns, some members of which undergo self-splicing.  we conclude that short introns are abundant in the human transcriptome, and short intron splicing represents an added layer to mrna regulation.  these short introns are often alternatively spliced and are found in a variety of rnas-both mrnas and lncrnas.  recent molecular evidence supports the idea that intronic rnas can reverse splice into rna transcripts, a crucial step for an influential model of intron gain.  this review article examines the process of normal intron-exon splicing, as well as what is known about alternative splicing of human genes.  constitutively spliced introns have evolved to utilize many different splicing factors.  we find that vertebrate recursive splicing requires initial definition of an 'rs-exon' that follows the rs-site.  it is generally believed that splicing removes introns as single units from precursor messenger rna transcripts.  in addition, we introduce two potential mechanisms for intron creation, based on hybrid rna-dna reverse splicing and on template switching errors by reverse transcriptase.  the prevalence of retained introns within genes monotonically increased in the 5'-to-3' direction (more retained introns close to the 3'-end), consistent with the model of co-transcriptional splicing.  exonic nucleotides that frame introns are involved in both protein coding and splicing.  pre-mrna splicing, an essential step in eukaryotic gene expression, relies on recognition of short sequences on the primary transcript intron ends and takes place along transcription by rna polymerase ii.  similarities between rna splicing during autocatalytic excision of group ii introns and pre-mrna processing led to the hypothesis that group ii introns might be the evolutionary predecessors of spliceosomal small nuclear rnas. ||| ",No
Are DNA helicases involved in progeroid syndromes?,Yes,"DNA helicases are indeed involved in progeroid syndromes. The context discusses Werner Syndrome (WS), a human progeroid disorder caused by mutations in the WRN helicase gene. This disorder is characterized by genomic instability and accelerated aging. The WRN gene encodes both a 3' --> 5' DNA helicase and a 3' --> 5' DNA exonuclease. DNA helicases, in general, have risen to the forefront as genome caretakers, and their prominent roles in chromosomal stability are demonstrated by the linkage of mutations in helicase genes to hereditary disorders with defects in DNA repair, the replication stress response, and/or transcriptional activation. Most progeroid disorders are linked to defects in genome maintenance. Altered transcription is speculated to play a causative role in aging and is involved in the pathology of most, if not all, progeroid syndromes.","werner syndrome (ws) is a human segmental progeria resulting from mutations in a dna helicase.  here we review the role of transcription in progeroid syndromes and discuss the implications of similar transcription aberrations in normal and premature aging.  their prominent roles in chromosomal stability are demonstrated by the linkage of mutations in helicase genes to hereditary disorders with defects in dna repair, the replication stress response, and/or transcriptional activation.  human progeroid syndromes are caused by mutations in single genes accelerating some but not all features of normal aging.  progeroid syndromes are genetic disorders that recapitulate some phenotypes of physiological ageing.  werner syndrome (ws), caused by mutations at the wrn helicase gene, is a progeroid syndrome characterized by multiple features consistent with accelerated aging.  werner syndrome (ws) is a human progeroid disorder characterized by genomic instability.  impaired dna damage repair, especially deficient transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair, leads to segmental progeroid syndromes in human patients as well as in rodent models.  dna helicases have risen to the forefront as genome caretakers.  most progeroid disorders are linked to defects in genome maintenance, and while it remains unknown if similar processes underlie normal and premature aging, they provide useful models for the study of aging.  classical progerias, such as hutchinson-gilford progeria syndrome (hgps), are generally caused by mutations in lmna leading to accumulation of the toxic protein progerin and consequently, to nuclear envelope alterations.  we discuss the roles of recq dna helicases in cancer, emphasizing some of the more recent developments in sl.  mutations in the werner gene promote the segmental progeroid werner syndrome (ws) with increased genomic instability and cancer.  altered transcription is speculated to play a causative role in aging, and is involved in the pathology of most if not all progeroid syndromes.  the gene mutated in werner syndrome encodes both a 3' --> 5' dna helicase and a 3' --> 5' dna exonuclease.  among the rt abnormalities, we identified the tumor protein p63 gene (tp63) as a gene marker for progeroid syndromes.  the gene defective in ws encodes a 3' --> 5' dna helicase (gray, m. d., shen, j.-c., kamath-loeb, a. s., blank, a. , sopher, b. l., martin, g. m., oshima, j., and loeb, l.  our results identified a progeroid-specific rt signature that is common to cells from three hgps and three rts patients and distinguishes them from healthy individuals across a wide range of ages.  possible mechanisms by which helicases might produce the variable phenotypes are discussed.  progeroid phenotypes are mainly encountered in 2 types of syndromes: in laminopathies, which are characterized by nuclear shape abnormalities due to lamin a alteration, and in dna damage response defect syndromes. ||| ",Yes
Is there a role for transcription factories in genome organization?,Yes,"Transcription factories have been proposed to play a significant role in genome organization. They are nuclear domains where gene transcription occurs, and they are thought to contribute to the formation of chromatin loops and the clustering of active and co-regulated genes. The transcription factory model suggests that these factories promote chromatin loop formation, enabling the simultaneous transcription of relatively distant genes. Furthermore, evidence indicates that individual factories can dynamically respond to increased transcriptional load by increasing in size. The fact that different factories may specialize in transcribing different groups of genes further supports their role in genome organization. However, the molecular basis for their formation and maintenance remains unknown, and the evidence for and against the transcription factory model is still under active discussion.","there is also some evidence that transcription factories could help organize chromatin and nuclear structure, contributing to both the formation of chromatin loops and the clustering of active and co-regulated genes.  the phenomenon of association of transcribed genes into so-called transcription factories and also the role of these associations in spatial organization of the eukaryotic genome are actively discussed in the modern literature.  the transcription factory model has implications for the regulation of transcription initiation and elongation, for the organization of genes in the genome, for the co-regulation of genes and for genome instability.  some authors think that the association of transcribed genes into transcription factories constitutes a major factor supporting the function-dependent three-dimensional organization of the interphase genome.  we review here the evidence that different factories may specialize in the transcription of different groups of genes.  this organization of polymerases into clusters--which we call transcription 'factories'--has important consequences.  it has been proposed that transcription factories promote chromatin loop formation, creating long-range interactions in which relatively distant genes can be transcribed simultaneously.  our results suggest that individual factories are dynamically organized and able to respond to the increased transcriptional load imposed by multiple highly transcribed genes by significantly increasing in size.  the evidence that such factories specialize in the transcription of particular groups of genes is reviewed.  in the eukaryotic nucleus, genes are transcribed in transcription factories.  transcription factories are nuclear domains where gene transcription takes place although the molecular basis for their formation and maintenance are unknown.  we also discuss new models that can explain the biological significance of clustering of transcribed genes and show possible mechanisms of the origin of transcription factories in the course of evolution.  this review discusses the experimental evidence in support of the transcription factory model and the evidence that argues against such a spatially structured view of transcription.  these studies apply innovative technical approaches to gain insights into the molecular constituents, dynamical behaviour and organizational regulators of transcription factories, providing exciting insights into the spatial dimension of transcriptional control.  there is increasing evidence that different transcription units are transcribed together in discrete nuclear structures known as transcription factories.  in particular, highly transcribed genes, rna polymerases and transcription factors gather into discrete spatial foci called transcription factories.  the low ratio of transcription factories to active genes and transcription units suggests that genes must share factories.  we examine here whether transcription occurs in discrete sites (factories) containing the required machinery and whether these sites specialize in transcribing different genes.  several studies over the past few years have added weight to the concept that transcription takes place within discrete 'transcription factories' assembled inside the cell nucleus.  here, we review recent studies that assessed the requirement of transcription and/or the transcription machinery for the establishment or maintenance of genome topology. ||| ",Yes
Is a mutation of the  ZIKV's membrane protein prM responsible for the microcephaly in new-born infants?,No,"The context does not provide evidence that a mutation of the Zika virus's (ZIKV) membrane protein prM is responsible for microcephaly in newborns. Instead, it highlights the association between ZIKV infection during pregnancy and the development of microcephaly in fetuses and newborns. The pathogenesis of ZIKV-related microcephaly is not well understood, but it is believed to be related to neuroinflammation, direct effects of virus replication on the developing central nervous system, and apoptosis of neural progenitor cells.

Is there any role of 5hmC in T-cell development and differentiation?,Yes,"The epigenetic modification 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmc) has been found to play crucial roles in both cellular development and differentiation, particularly in T-cells. 5hmc is involved in promoting gene expression, a process regulated by Tet enzymes.

The application of siRNAs for both functional analysis of genes and medication raises several questions, including the potential for siRNAs to affect the response to other cancer treatments such as afatinib. The delivery of therapeutically active siRNAs into the target tissue/target cells in vivo is a major issue, but the use of adenoviral vectors and chemical modifications to the siRNA have been shown to improve cellular uptake and stability. Therefore, it is possible that siRNAs could affect the response to afatinib treatment, although further research is needed to confirm this.","small interfering rnas (sirnas) can synergistically enhance the cell killing effects of drugs used in cancer treatment.  this article provides further evidence of sirna-induced off-target effects generating a measurable phenotype and also provides an example of how such undesirable phenotypes can be mitigated by addition of chemical modifications to the sirna.  despite all the potential of sirna as a novel class of drugs, the limited cellular uptake, low biological stability, and unfavorable pharmacokinetics of sirnas have limited their application in the clinic.  cell cycle arrest in both cell lines occurred at lower levels after sirna + doxorubicin treatment compared to doxorubicin only.  rnai might constitute a novel therapeutic approach for cancer treatment because researchers can easily design sirna molecules to inhibit, specifically and potently, the expression of any protein involved in tumor initiation and progression.  we determine the sirna-induced changes in kinetic rates and their correlations between target and reference protein expression.  the application of sirnas for both functional analysis of genes and medication raises several questions.  here we show that a fraction of randomly selected small inhibitory rnas (sirnas) can induce changes in cell viability in a target-independent fashion.  in practice, a number of factors influence whether an sirna sequence will elicit rnai and knockdown target gene expression.  sirna targeting halr and anti-halr mcab significantly inhibited the growth of xenograft tumor in 5 nude mice.  since it relies on small interfering rnas (sirnas), which are the mediators of rnai-induced specific mrna degradation, a major issue is the delivery of therapeutically active sirnas into the target tissue/target cells in vivo.  the anti-tumoral effects of pei/sirna-based targeting of tumor-relevant genes in vivo are described.  the adenoviral vector expressing small interfering rna (sirna) is highly effective in mammalian cells.  small-interfering rnas (sirnas) can be used to knockdown gene expression of specific mrnas.  we applied the adenovirus-delivered sirna (adsirna) to inhibit a hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc) oncogene, p28gank, in hcc cell lines and investigated its antitumor effects.  this review highlights the recent knowledge on the guidelines for the selection of sirnas which show high activity in the absence of non-specific sirna effects.  the effector molecules-small interfering rnas (sirnas) and micrornas (mirnas)-can be used to silence or ""switch off"" specific cancer genes.  the sirna targeting halr and anti-halr mcab inhibited obviously the growth of hepg2 cells in vitro.  in addition, pegylation impairs the internalization of the sirna into the target cell and its subsequent escape from the endocytic pathway, which reduces biological activity.  self-structure in either the sirna sequence or the target mrna at the binding site may prevent gene silencing. ||| ",Yes
Are osteoclasts specialized in bone degradation?,Yes,"Osteoclasts are indeed specialized in bone degradation. They are multinucleated cells that are generated by the differentiation of monocyte/macrophage hematopoietic lineages. Osteoclasts have a unique bone-destroying capacity, which is characterized by the high expression of enzymes such as tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) and cathepsin K (CTSK). These cells are responsible for the degradation of bone matrix by secreting lytic enzymes. The major function of osteoclasts is to hydrolyze inorganic hydroxyapatite and degrade organic bone matrix, mainly collagen. Osteoclasts are the exclusive cells of bone resorption and are central mediators of both normal bone remodeling and pathologies associated with excessive bone resorption.","osteoclasts, specialized cells that degrade bone, are key components of the cellular system that regulates and maintains bone homeostasis.  osteoclasts have a unique bone-destroying capacity, playing key roles in steady-state bone remodeling and arthritic bone erosion.  osteoclasts are multinuclear cells that degrade bone under both physiological and pathophysiological conditions.  osteoclasts are multinucleated cells specialized in degrading bone and characterized by high expression of the enzymes tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (trap) and cathepsin k (ctsk).  osteoclasts are unique cells that resorb bone, and are involved in not only bone remodeling but also pathological bone loss such as osteoporosis and rheumatoid arthritis.  osteoclasts are bone-specific multinucleated cells generated by differentiation of monocyte/macrophage hematopoietic lineages and degrade bone matrix by secretion of lytic enzymes.  osteoclasts are highly specialized cells that resorb bone and contribute to bone remodeling.  osteoclasts are large, mobile, bone-resorbing cells and play a critical role in bone remodeling and catabolic bone diseases.  the major function of osteoclasts is to hydrolyze inorganic hydroxyapatite and degrade organic bone matrix, mainly collagen.  the multinucleated osteoclast has a unique function: degradation of mineralized tissues.  osteoclasts are the exclusive cells of bone resorption.  as the only cells capable of efficiently resorbing bone, osteoclasts are central mediators of both normal bone remodeling and pathologies associates with excessive bone resorption.  osteoclasts are bone-resorbing cells essential for skeletal remodeling and regeneration.  osteoclasts, the bone resorbing cells, play a key role both in normal bone remodeling and in the skeletal osteopenia of arthritis, osteoporosis, periodontal disease and certain malignancies.  osteoclasts (ocs) are important cells that are involved in the regulation of bone metabolism and are mainly responsible for coordinating bone resorption with bone formation to regulate bone remodeling.  several studies have now described the molecular mechanisms by which osteoblasts control osteoclastogenesis and bone degradation.  we studied the effect of osteoblast conditioned medium on bone degradation by multinucleated osteoclast-like cells generated in vitro from mononuclear precursors and found that the medium stimulates bone degradation primarily through interactions with osteoclast precursors.  osteoclasts are therefore a major target of osteoporosis therapeutics aimed at preserving bone.  osteoclasts, the only cells with bone resorption functions in vivo, maintain the balance of bone metabolism by cooperating with osteoblasts, which are responsible for bone formation.  osteoclasts are multinucleated, bone-resorbing cells. ||| ",Yes
Is micro RNA 1 (miR-1) implicated in cardiac arrhythmias?,Yes,"Justification: A substantial body of research has established that microRNA-1 (miR-1) is implicated in the development of arrhythmias in various myocardial pathological conditions. This involvement is mediated through the post-transcriptional regulation of a diverse array of ion channels and proteins that are integral to cardiac electrical activity. Changes in the abundance of muscle-specific miR-1 have been linked to cardiac diseases, including arrhythmia and heart failure. The relationship between miR-1 and ion channels and proteins in the arrhythmia process is of particular interest. The role of miR-1 in cardiac pathology is not yet fully understood, but its critical role in the global control of gene expression in the heart has been postulated. Aberrant expression of various miRNA species, including miR-1, has been implicated in numerous cardiac diseases, such as heart failure, hypertrophy, conduction disturbances, and arrhythmogenesis. Furthermore, miR-1 has been found to accelerate right atrial tachypacing-induced AERP shortening by targeting potassium channel genes, suggesting its significant role in the electrical remodeling of atrial fibrillation.","a large number of studies have demonstrated that mirna-1(mir-1) is involved in the occurrence of arrhythmia in many myocardial pathological conditions by post-transcriptionally regulating a variety of ion channels and proteins related to cardiac electrical activity.  changes in abundance of muscle-specific microrna, mir-1, have been implicated in cardiac disease, including arrhythmia and heart failure.  we aim at emphasizing the relationship between mir-1 and ion channels and proteins involved in the process of arrhythmia.  the effect on the heart ex vivo was demonstrated through investigating arrhythmia-associated human single nucleotide polymorphisms with mir1-deficient mice.  background: micrornas (mirnas) have been emerged as important regulator in a multiple of cardiovascular disease, including arrhythmia, cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis, and myocardial infarction.  micrornas (mirs) play critical roles in regulation of numerous biological events, including cardiac electrophysiology and arrhythmia, through a canonical rna interference mechanism.  micrornas (mirnas) play key roles in cardiac development, and the expression of mirnas is altered in the diseased heart.  the critical role of micrornas (mirnas) in the global control of gene expression in the heart has recently been postulated; however, the mechanisms of mirna regulation in cardiac pathology are not clear.  micrornas (mirnas/mirs) such as mir-1, mir-133a, mir-133b, mir-135a, and mir-29b play a key role in many cardiac pathological remodeling processes, including apoptosis, fibrosis, and arrhythmias, after a myocardial infarction (mi).  micrornas (mirs) contribute to different aspects of cardiovascular pathology, among others cardiac hypertrophy and atrial fibrillation.  among them, the cardiac enriched microrna-1 (mir-1) has been extensively studied and proven to be detrimental to cardiac myocytes.  aberrant expression of various mirna species has been implicated in numerous cardiac diseases, e.g., heart failure, hypertrophy, conduction disturbances, and arrhythmogenesis.  microrna-1 (mir-1) is approved involved in cardiac hypertrophy, but the underlying molecular mechanisms of mir-1 in cardiac hypertrophy are not well elucidated.  recently, it has been recognized that changes in microribonucleic acid (mirna) expression may lead to cardiac dysfunction.  microrna (mirna/mir)‑122 has been reported to be related with heart diseases, however, the functional role of mir‑122 in atrial fibrillation is unclear.  in this study, we investigated mir-1 expression and its potential role in the mouse model of viral myocarditis (vmc).  mir-1, mir-133a, and mir-133b have the potential to become diagnostic biomarkers of arrhythmia in pediatric patients.  microrna-1 (mir-1) has been found in cardiac and skeletal tissues.  micrornas (mirnas) play essential roles in cardiogenesis.  these results indicate that mir-1 accelerates right atrial tachypacing-induced aerp shortening by targeting potassium channel genes, which further suggests that mir-1 plays an important role in the electrical remodeling of atrial fibrillation and exhibits significant clinical relevance as a potential therapeutic target for atrial fibrillation. ||| ",Yes
Is there any role of Dlx1 and Dlx2 transcription factors in cortical interneurons?,Yes,"Dlx1 and Dlx2 transcription factors play a central role in the development and postnatal functions of cortical interneurons. They are essential for the production of forebrain gabaergic interneurons during embryonic development. In postnatal stages, Dlx1 expression is preferential in a subset of cortical and hippocampal interneurons, and its absence leads to a time-dependent reduction in their number. Dlx1/2 also restrains neurite growth of subpallial-derived immature interneurons during their tangential migration to the cortex. Furthermore, Dlx1 is required for regulating the functional longevity of cortical and hippocampal interneurons in the adult brain. The transcription factors coordinate key components of cortical interneuron postnatal development by promoting their excitability, inhibitory output, and survival.","the postnatal functions of the dlx1&2 transcription factors in cortical interneurons (cins) are unknown.  we demonstrate preferential dlx1 expression in a subset of cortical and hippocampal interneurons which, in postnatal dlx1 mutants, show a time-dependent reduction in number.  dlx1, a member of the homeobox domain transcriptional factors, is expressed in a subset of interneurons and is involved in their differentiation.  our experimental data support the idea that dlx1 expression in developing interneurons specifically suppresses two important downstream regulators, leading to the characteristic morphology of dlx1-expressing interneurons with less branched dendrites and few dendritic spines.  vertebrate dlx genes have been implicated in the differentiation of multiple neuronal subtypes, including cortical gabaergic interneurons, and mutations in dlx genes have been linked to clinical conditions such as epilepsy and autism.  here, we demonstrate that dlx1/2 has a central role in restraining neurite growth of subpallial-derived immature interneurons at a stage when they migrate tangentially to cortex.  dlx homeodomain transcription factors are essential during embryonic development for the production of forebrain gabaergic interneurons.  here we show that dlx1 is also required for regulating the functional longevity of cortical and hippocampal interneurons in the adult brain.  the dlx transcription factors have a central role in controlling the development of gamma-aminobutyric acid (gaba)-ergic neurons in the forebrain.  dlx5 and dlx6 encode two homeobox transcription factors expressed by developing and mature gabaergic interneurons.  expression of the homeodomain-containing transcription factors dlx-1 and dlx-2 in the lateral (lge) and medial (mge) ganglionic eminences, subpallial embryonic structures, is required for generation of telencephalic interneurons.  we propose that dlx1/2 promote ob interneuron development mainly through activating the expression of sp8/9, which further promote tshz1 and prokr2 expression.  thus, dlx1&2 coordinate key components of cin postnatal development by promoting their excitability, inhibitory output, and survival.  our results identify another role for dlx genes as modulators of neuron versus oligodendrocyte development in the ventral embryonic forebrain.  to understand the roles of dlx1 in dendritic and postsynaptic differentiation, we manipulated dlx1 expression in both excitatory pyramidal neurons and inhibitory interneurons in hippocampal culture.  the widespread expression of dlx mrna and protein in the adult brain suggests that these genes may have additional roles in mature animals.  in dlx1-/-;dlx2+/- mutants, while the tangential migration of immature interneurons appears normal, they develop dendritic and axonal processes with increased length and decreased branching, and have deficits in their neocortical laminar positions.  cell transplantation analysis demonstrates that interneuron loss reflects cell-autonomous functions of dlx1.  in addition to its expression in the developing forebrain, dlx-1 is transcribed in several structures containing cells of neural crest origin such as the facial mesenchyme and various elements of the peripheral nervous system.  here, we show that the homeobox transcription factors dlx1/2 are central and essential components in the transcriptional code for generating ob interneurons. ||| ",Yes
Is the UGT1A1*28 polymorphism associated with irinotecan response in Caucasians?,Yes,"The UGT1A1*28 polymorphism is associated with irinotecan-induced toxicities in Caucasians, as evidenced by previous studies.

The UGT1A1*28 polymorphism is considered the main pharmacogenetic predictor of the toxicity outcome of irinotecan-treated patients. It is also known as a biomarker of irinotecan-induced neutropenia in Caucasians. The data suggest that the UGT1A1*28 polymorphism may be a key determinant for predicting irinotecan-induced severe toxicities without affecting treatment outcome for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.","previous studies of irinotecan pharmacogenetics have shown that the ugt1a1*28 polymorphism has an effect on irinotecan (iri)-induced toxicities in caucasians.  the ugt1a1*28 polymorphism is known as a biomarker of irinotecan-induced neutropenia in caucasians.  our data showed that the ugt1a1*28 polymorphism had a significant relationship with toxicity and response to irinotecan-based chemotherapy.  the ugt1a1*28 polymorphism was suggested to be significantly connected with irinotecan-induced toxicity and response to chemotherapy.  our purpose was to study the association between ugt1a1*28, ugt1a7*2, and ugt1a7*3 polymorphisms and irinotecan toxicity in greek patients receiving low-dose weekly irinotecan.  the purpose of this study was to determine the associations between ugt1a1(*)28 and (*)6 polymorphisms and irinotecan toxicity in thai patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.  ugt1a1 polymorphisms in the coding region of the ugt1a1 gene should be genotyped in addition to testing for ugt1a1*28 to more accurately predict irinotecan-related toxicity, at least in asian patients.  ugt1a1 gene polymorphism predicts irinotecan-related adverse reactions in advanced crc patients of xinjiang uygur and han nationality; ugt1a1 gene polymorphism is correlated with efficacy and prognosis in uygur nationality, but only related to prognosis in han nationality in irinotecan-based chemotherapy.  ugt1a1*28 is considered the main pharmacogenetic predictor of the toxicity outcome of irinotecan-treated patients.  it is known that the uridine-diphosphoglucuronosyl transferase 1a1 (ugt1a1)*28 polymorphism reduces ugt1a1 enzyme activity, which may lead to severe toxicities in patients who receive irinotecan.  the current data suggested that the ugt1a1*28 polymorphism may be a key determinant for predicting irinotecan-induced severe toxicities without affecting treatment outcome for patients with metastatic crc.  both ugt1a1(*)28 and (*)6 polymorphisms may have an increased risk of irinotecan-induced neutropenia in thai colorectal cancer patients.  concurrence of ugt1a1*28 and ugt1a1*6, even when heterozygous, altered the disposition of irinotecan remarkably, potentially increasing susceptibility to toxicity.  uridine 5'-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase (ugt), a metabolic enzyme of irinotecan active metabolite, has two genetic polymorphisms (ugt1a1*6 and ugt1a1*28).  irinotecan-induced severe toxicities are possibly related to ugt1a1*6 and *28 genotypes.  ugt1a1 is a polymorphic enzyme that has been associated with irinotecan drug metabolisms.  the relationship between ugt1a1*6/*28 and abcb1-3435c>t polymorphisms and irinotecan induced severe diarrhea and neutropenia were analyzed.  udp-glucuronosyltransferase1a1 (ugt1a1) polymorphisms have been related with irinotecan toxicity.  various polymorphisms have been detected in the udp-glucuronosyltransferase 1a ( ugt1a ) gene, and ugt1a1 *28 and ugt1a1 *6 have important effects on the pharmacokinetics of irinotecan and the risk of severe toxicities during irinotecan therapy.  uridine glucuronosyltransferase (ugt) gene polymorphisms have been linked to irinotecan toxicity. ||| ",Yes
Is miR-126 involved in heart failure?,Yes,"The context suggests that miR-126 is involved in heart failure, not as a direct cause, but as a potential biomarker. It has been reported to serve as a potential biomarker of acute myocardial infarction, which is a significant cause of heart failure. Additionally, miR-126 has been implicated in the processes of inflammation and angiogenesis, both of which are associated with heart failure. However, the context does not provide direct evidence of miR-126's role in the development or progression of heart failure.","the aim of this study was to investigate the role of mir-129-5p in chronic heart failure and the underlying mechanisms.  increasing evidence shows that mirnas play pivotal roles in cardiovascular diseases, including heart failure (hf).  microrna-24 (mir-24) plays an important role in heart failure by reducing the efficiency of myocardial excitation-contraction coupling.  aberrant expression of various mirna species has been implicated in numerous cardiac diseases, e.g., heart failure, hypertrophy, conduction disturbances, and arrhythmogenesis.  circulating mirna‑21 has potential to be a biomarker of heart failure.  the levels of mir-129-5p and hmgb1 in chronic heart failure patients (chf) and normal controls were examined by rt-qpcr and elisa.  the correlations between circulating mirna‑21 and diagnosis, severity, prognosis and re‑hospitalization rate of heart failure were evaluated using statistical analysis.  prolonged cardiac hypertrophy may lead to heart failure, but little is known about the role of mir-24 in cardiac hypertrophy.  as an endothelium-enriched microrna (mirna), mir-126 has been reported to serve as a potential biomarker of acute myocardial infarction.  in this study, we found that mir-96 is a negative regulator of cardiac hypertrophy.  mir-126 has been implicated in the processes of inflammation and angiogenesis.  the current study assessed circulating mirna‑21 as a viable indicator for diagnosis and prognosis of heart failure.  we observed that mir-124 was elevated in angii-induced hypertrophic cardiomyocytes.  cardiac hypertrophy is a crucial predictor of heart failure and is regulated by micrornas.  in conclusion, our study shows that inhibition of mir-124 effectively suppresses angii-induced myocardial hypertrophy, which is associated with attenuation of er stress.  therefore, our study aimed to determine the role of mir-124 in angiotensin ii(angii)-induced myocardial hypertrophy and the possible mechanism.  we aimed to identify the specific underlying mechanism of mir-320 in cardiac fibrosis and hypertrophic pathogenesis.  mirna-375-3p (mir-375-3p) was involved in cardiac dysfunction and cardiogenesis.  micrornas participate in the regulation of abnormal cardiomyocyte apoptosis and autophagy, which leads to heart failure (hf).  microrna 21 (mirna‑21) promotes the development of cardiac fibrosis, hypertrophy and heart failure. ||| ",Yes

Is there any linear-time and linear-space algorithm for the computation of avoided words in biological sequences?,Yes,"The described algorithm for generating minimal absent words in DNA sequences has been shown to run in approximately linear time. This algorithm addresses the problem of finding the shortest absent words in DNA data and provides a larger class of absent words, called minimal absent words, that still captures the essential properties of the shortest absent words. The number of minimal absent words is manageable since it grows at most linearly with the string size, unlike generic absent words that grow exponentially. The algorithm and the concepts upon which it depends shed additional light on the structure of absent words and complement existing studies on the topic.

Are thyroid hormone receptor alpha1 mutations  implicated in thyroid hormone resistance syndrome?,Yes,"Thyroid hormone receptor alpha1 (TRα1) mutations are indeed implicated in thyroid hormone resistance syndrome (RTH). This rare genetic disorder is characterized by elevated serum thyroid hormone levels and unsuppressed thyrotropin (TSH) levels, along with tissue hyposensitivity to thyroid hormone. The syndrome is caused by mutations in either the thyroid hormone receptor beta (TRβ) gene or the thyroid hormone receptor alpha (TRα) gene. Specifically, mutations in the TRα gene, which encodes the TRα1 receptor, result in a form of RTH known as RTHα. This disorder is characterized by tissue-specific hypothyroidism and near-normal thyroid function tests. Despite the high serum thyroid hormone levels, the mutated TRα1 receptors are unable to effectively bind and respond to the hormone, leading to the observed resistance.","background: in humans, resistance to thyroid hormone (rth) caused by mutations in the thyroid hormone receptor alpha (thra) gene, rthα, manifests as tissue-specific hypothyroidism and circulating thyroid hormone levels exhibit hypothyroid-like clinical features.  heterozygous mutations in the thyroid hormone receptor alpha (thra) gene cause resistance to thyroid hormone alpha (rthα), a disease characterized by variable manifestations reminiscent of untreated congenital hypothyroidism but a raised triiodothyronine/thyroxine ratio and normal thyrotropin levels.  resistance to thyroid hormone alpha (rthα) is a rare and under-recognized genetic disease caused by mutations of thra, the gene encoding thyroid hormone receptor α1 (trα1).  resistance to thyroid hormone due to thra mutations (rthα) is a recently discovered genetic disease, displaying important variability in its clinical presentation.  mutations of the thyroid hormone receptor beta (trbeta) gene cause resistance to thyroid hormone (rth).  resistance to thyroid hormone syndrome (rth) is an autosomal dominant or recessive genetic disease caused by mutation of either the thyroid hormone receptorβ (thr-β) gene or the thyroid hormone receptorα (thr-α) gene.  mutations in the thyroid hormone receptor beta (tr beta) gene result in tr beta 1 mutants that mediate the clinical phenotype by interfering with transcription of thyroid hormone-regulated genes via a dominant negative effect.  resistance to thyroid hormone alpha (rthα), a disorder characterized by tissue-selective hypothyroidism and near-normal thyroid function tests due to thyroid receptor alpha gene mutations, is rare but probably under-recognized.  about 85% of patients with rth harbor mutations in thyroid hormone receptor  (tr).  activating somatic mutations in the thyrotropin (tsh) receptor have been identified as a cause of hyperfunctioning thyroid adenomas, and germline mutations have been found in familial nonautoimmune hyperthyroidism and sporadic congenital hyperthyroidism.  resistance to thyroid hormone beta (rthβ) is an inherited syndrome caused by mutations in the thyroid hormone receptor β (thrb) gene.  rthα is a recently discovered resistance to thyroid hormone (rth) due to mutation of thra, the gene encoding trα1, the thyroid hormone receptor.  constitutively activating mutations of the thyrotropin (tsh) receptor have been identified as a molecular cause of toxic adenomas, nonautoimmune familial hyperthyroidism, and sporadic congenital hyperthyroidism.  resistance to thyroid hormone (rth) is a rare autosomal hereditary disorder characterized by increased serum thyroid hormone (th) levels with unsuppressed or increased thyrotropin concentration.  patients with mutations in thrb present with resistance to thyroid hormone β (rthβ), which is a disorder characterized by elevated levels of thyroid hormone, normal or elevated levels of tsh and goitre.  thyroid hormone resistance (rth) is a rare autosomal dominant disorder, characterized clinically by goiter and biochemically by elevated circulating free thyroid hormone levels in the presence of measurable serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (tsh) concentrations.  these patients had a clinical syndrome of resistance to th associated with high serum th and nonsuppressed thyroid-stimulating hormone levels.  autosomal dominant non-autoimmune hyperthyroidism is caused by activating tshr germline mutations.  resistance to thyroid hormone (rth) is a clinical syndrome characterized by elevated serum thyroid hormone (th) levels, unsuppressed thyrotropin (tsh) levels, and tissue hyposensitivity to th.  resistance to thyroid hormone (rth) is a syndrome characterized by refractoriness of the pituitary and/or peripheral tissues to the action of thyroid hormone. ||| ",Yes
Is RIP1 (RIP-1) part of the necrosome?,Yes,"The context indicates that Receptor Interacting Protein Kinase 1 (RIP1) is a key component of the necrosome, a signaling complex that triggers necroptosis. RIP1 associates with RIP3 to form the necrosome, and both proteins are the main mediators of necroptosis, a form of programmed necrosis. The RIP homotypic interaction motif (RHIM) of RIP1 and RIP3 form an amyloidal complex in the necrosome. Furthermore, RIP1 plays a critical role in the initiation of necroptosis and is involved in apoptosis and inflammatory signaling. The context also suggests that RIP1-RIP3 interaction is required for necroptosis signaling. Therefore, it can be concluded that RIP1 is indeed a part of the necrosome.","receptor interacting protein kinase 1 (ripk1/rip1) and rip3 are key components of the necrosome.  rip1 also associates with rip3 to form the necrosome that triggers necroptosis.  necroptosis is a type of programmed necrosis regulated by receptor interacting protein kinase 1 (rip1) and rip3.  in necrosomes, the rip homotypic interaction motif (rhim) of rip3 and rip1 forms amyloidal complex.  necroptosis is a form of programmed necrosis mediated by signaling complexes with receptor-interacting protein 1 (rip1) and rip3 kinases as the main mediators.  as increased rip1 ubiquitination in the necrosome correlates with impaired rip1 and rip3 phosphorylation and function, these results suggest that cyld controls rip1 kinase activity during necrosome assembly.  we further demonstrate that rip1 within the np-40 insoluble necrosome is ubiquitinated and that cyld regulates rip1 ubiquitination in this compartment.  tnfα is a prototypic inducer of necrosome activation, and it is widely believed that deubiquitination of rip1 at the tnfr-1 signaling complex precedes transition of rip1 into the cytosol where it forms the rip1-rip3 necrosome.  it is known that rip1 and rip3 form heterodimeric filamentous scaffold in necrosomes through their rip homotypic interaction motif (rhim) domain-mediated oligomerization, but the signaling events based on this scaffold has not been fully addressed.  necroptosis is mediated by a signaling complex called necrosome, containing receptor-interacting protein (rip)1, rip3, and mixed-lineage kinase domain-like (mlkl).  receptor interacting protein 1 (rip1) has a critical role in initiation of programmed necrosis or necroptosis.  necroptosis is mediated by signaling complexes called necrosomes, which contain receptor-interacting protein 3 (rip3) and upstream effectors, such as rip1.  rip1 in a close collaboration with rip3 not only mediates necroptosis but also is involved in apoptosis and inflammatory signaling.  interestingly, phosphorylation of one of rip3 in the dimer is sufficient to induce necroptosis.  these results strongly suggest that ck1 proteins are necrosome components which are responsible for ripk3-s227 phosphorylation.  by using inducible dimer systems we found that rip1-rip1 interaction is dispensable for necroptosis; rip1-rip3 interaction is required for necroptosis signaling, but there is no necroptosis if no additional rip3 protein is recruited to the rip1-rip3 heterodimer, and the interaction with rip1 promotes the rip3 to recruit other rip3; rip3-rip3 interaction is required for necroptosis and rip3-rip3 dimerization is sufficient to induce necroptosis; and rip3 dimer-induced necroptosis requires mlkl.  under the latter conditions, rip1-rip3 necrosome formation is only delayed, but not abolished in cyld(-/-) cells.  receptor-interacting protein kinase-3 (rip3 or ripk3) is a central protein in necroptosis, but posttranslational processes that regulate rip3 activity and stability remain poorly understood.  receptor interacting protein 1 (rip1), which plays a key role in apoptosis, cell survival and programmed cell necrosis, is one of the most important proteins in the rip family.  we further show that rip3 oligomer is not more potent than rip3 dimer in triggering necroptosis, suggesting that rip3 homo-interaction in the complex, rather than whether rip3 has formed homo polymer, is important for necroptosis. ||| ",Yes
Are cutaneous porphyrias inherited with a recessive pattern?,No,"The cutaneous porphyrias are a group of inherited disorders that result in defects in the enzymes of the heme biosynthetic pathway. The mendelian inheritance pattern of acute intermittent porphyria, hereditary coproporphyria, and variegate porphyria is autosomal dominant, but the clinical phenotype is heterogeneous. The non-acute porphyrias, which present clinically as cutaneous photosensitivity, are largely dermatological conditions. However, a few cases of late-onset recessive porphyrias have been reported. These findings suggest that these late-onset porphyrias may be heterozygous for their gene defects, but clinical expression may be elicited if there is a loss of heterozygosity. Therefore, it can be concluded that cutaneous porphyrias are not inherited with a recessive pattern.","porphyria cutanea tarda may be inherited, but is more commonly acquired.  the manifestation of porphyria cutanea tarda reflects genetic and environmental factors.  however, a few cases of late-onset recessive porphyrias have been reported.  the mendelian inheritance pattern of acute intermittent porphyria, hereditary coproporphyria, and variegate porphyria is autosomal dominant, but the clinical phenotype is heterogeneous.  the porphyrias are a group of inherited disorders that result in defects in the enzymes of the haem biosynthetic pathway, causing photosensitive bullous skin eruptions or abdominal and neurological attacks.  porphyrias are inherited disorders of heme biosynthesis.  the porphyrias are a rare group of metabolic disorders that can either be inherited or acquired.  the cutaneous porphyrias present with either bullous skin fragility or nonbullous acute photosensitivity.  these findings suggest that these late-onset porphyrias may be heterozygous for their gene defects, but clinical expression may be elicited if there is a loss of heterozygosity, either by a clonal expansion of the porphyric allele or by a loss of function mutation in the other allele.  the porphyrias are a group of rare metabolic disorders, inherited or acquired, along the heme biosynthetic pathway, which could manifest with neurovisceral and/or cutaneous symptoms, depending on the defective enzyme.  thirteen patients (25%) had familial porphyria cutanea tarda.  occasionally two forms of porphyria may co-exist.  mutations in the uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase gene, located at chromosome 1p34, discriminate familial porphyria cutanea tarda from sporadic cases.  individuals with the most common form of the porphyrias, porphyria cutanea tarda (pct), are believed to be genetically predisposed to development of clinically overt disease through mutations and polymorphisms in genes associated with known precipitating factors.  eight patients with porphyria cutanea tarda (15%) were homozygous for the haemochromatosis gene c282y mutation and 8 patients were heterozygous.  porphyrias are a family of rare diseases chiefly due to inborn errors of heme biosynthesis.  this seems to confirm a relationship between porphyria cutanea tarda and haemochromatosis.  a form of porphyria inherited as a mendelian dominant characteristic can cause both cutaneous lesions on the exposed skin and attacks of acute porphyria following certain drugs, for instance barbiturates.  the porphyrias are a group of mainly inherited disorders of heme biosynthesis where accumulation of porphyrins and/or porphyrin precursors gives rise to 2 types of clinical presentation: cutaneous photosensitivity and/or acute neurovisceral attacks.  the non-acute porphyrias are largely dermatological conditions, which present clinically as cutaneous photosensitivity. ||| ",No
Is intense physical activity associated with longevity?,Yes,"The context suggests that intense physical activity, including high-intensity training to improve cardiorespiratory fitness, is associated with longevity and slowing down the aging process. There is evidence that increasing exercise intensity in older adults may be associated with greater reductions in the risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality. Performing three to five times the recommended physical activity minimum reaches the maximal longevity benefit. Regular physical activity, including intense exercise, is beneficial for healthy aging, promoting independence, and increasing the quality of life.","in this study, the relationship between moderate physical activity and longevity was investigated, taking into account age, gender, smoking habits, cohabitation status, body mass index, leg strength and balance, education level and cognitive function.  endurance exercise, including high-intensity training to improve cardiorespiratory fitness promotes longevity and slows down aging.  in an aging society, however, active life expectancy and maintenance of independence may be as important as effects of regular exercise on longevity.  robust epidemiological evidence exists that lifelong regular exercise contributes to longevity.  high levels of physical activity seem to positively influence health and cognition across the lifespan.  physical activity is beneficial for healthy ageing.  indeed, there is evidence to suggest that increasing exercise intensity in older adults may be associated with greater reductions in the risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality.  older people who exercise regularly tent to be those at whom we marvel: they live longer, more vigorous, independent lives.  longitudinal mixed effects models were used to assess the effect of sport or exercise group membership on physical activity and longevity across a 14-year follow-up.  there is consolidated evidence that physical activity exerts beneficial effects on several chronic conditions and longevity, on the basis of its proposed biological effects, especially on lipid profiles.  objectives: moderate physical activity gains survival.  evidence, mainly from cross-sectional studies, suggests that physical activity is a potentially important modifiable factor associated with physical performance and strength in older age.  cox regression analyses were used to investigate the predictive value of physical activity on longevity.  to examine whether engaging in physical activity in the context of sport or exercise group membership can protect against age-related physical activity decline.  physical activity plays an important role for achieving healthy aging by promoting independence and increasing the quality of life.  performing three to five times the recommended physical activity minimum reaches the maximal longevity benefit, that can be achieved.  the quality of life in old age is crucially dependent upon the ability to pursue a variety of physical activities.  meeting the currently recommended amounts of leisure time physical aerobic activity of moderate intensity of at least 150 min/week provides most of the longevity benefit.  the aim of this review is to discuss recent findings regarding, which dose and type of physical activity promotes a long healthy life, free of disease.  regular physical activity relates to physical and mental functioning in older people, and promoting physical activity has the potential to substantially reduce functional decline and improve well-being. ||| ",Yes
Is Musclin a secretory peptide?,Yes,"Musclin is a novel skeletal muscle-derived secretory factor that has been identified and characterized in recent studies. It is a peptide that is responsive to insulin in vivo and induces insulin resistance in vitro. The full-length musclin protein and its cleaved form are secreted in the media of musclin cDNA-transfected mammalian cell cultures. Furthermore, musclin is found to bind with the natriuretic peptide clearance receptors, and its protein contains a region homologous to the natriuretic peptide family.

Is corpus callosum involved in the Mowat–Wilson syndrome?,No,"justification

    The provided context does not mention the Mowat-Wilson syndrome, a rare genetic disorder characterized by distinctive facial features, intellectual disability, delayed development, and multiple congenital anomalies. Therefore, it is not possible to determine if the corpus callosum is involved in the Mowat-Wilson syndrome based solely on the given context.

    However, it is known that the corpus callosum is involved in various neurological disorders, including developmental malformations, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and epilepsy. The corpus callosum plays a crucial role in inter-hemispheric transfer and integration of information, and alterations in its area and morphology have been suggested in several disease processes of the nervous system.

    In summary, while the context does not provide information on the involvement of the corpus callosum in the Mowat-Wilson syndrome, it highlights the importance of the corpus callosum in various neurological disorders.","developmental malformations of the corpus callosum (ccd) can lead to learning and intellectual disabilities.  the corpus callosum has been implicated in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.  alterations in midsagittal corpus callosum (cc) area and morphology have been suggested in several disease processes of the nervous system.  corpus callosum (cc) abnormalities are frequently reported in patients with refractory mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (rmtle).  nine patients had corpus callosum abnormalities, 4 of 9 patients had abnormal signal in the genu and splenium, 5 of 9 patients had abnormal signal only in the splenium.  corpus callosum shape deformation, therefore, may reflect a midline neurodevelopmental abnormality.  background: the regional distribution of the widespread cerebral morphological alterations in progressive supranuclear palsy (psp) is considered to include segmental parts of the corpus callosum (cc).  wilson's disease (wd) with neurological presentation is associated with brain lesions classically localised in globus pallidus, putamen, thalamus, mesencephalon, pons and dentate nucleus.  the corpus callosum (cc) plays a pivotal role in inter-hemispheric transfer and integration of information and is a relatively understudied structure in bipolar disorder (bd).  the corpus callosum, the largest white matter tract in the brain, is a midline structure associated with the formation of the hippocampus, septum pellucidum, and cingulate cortex, which have been implicated in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia.  a correlation between width and angle of the corpus callosum was found in patients with affective disorder.  we examined the corpus callosum and its subregion volumes and their relationship to cognition, psychotic symptoms, and age in probands with schizophrenia (sz), psychotic bipolar disorder (pbd), and schizoaffective disorder; their first-degree relatives; and healthy control subjects.  the corpus callosum modulates interhemispheric communication and cognitive processes.  rather, the corpus callosum seems important for transferring lateralised information (such as verbal or visuospatial activity) of the pre-motor variety.  lesions of corpus callosum (cc) have not been studied in a broad population of patients with wd.  corpus callosum is the most important commissure of the brain and therefore represents a first-choice candidate to challenge hypotheses of disrupted inter-hemispheric connectivity and white matter pathology in patients with schizophrenia.  our findings indicate wilson's disease can involve the posterior as well as the anterior part of cc and patients with cc involvement had more extensive brain lesions, more severe neurological dysfunctions and psychiatric symptoms.  this study aimed to compare clinical features between wd-cca and wd without corpus callosum abnormalities (wd-no-cca).  corpus callosum shape abnormalities in first-episode psychotic patients with schizophrenia may reflect a midline neurodevelopmental abnormality.  this pictorial essay shows the mri findings in fetal corpus callosal developmental abnormalities in a very systematic manner. ||| ",Yes
Does Uc.160 promote cancer?,Yes,"The -160c/a polymorphism (rs16260) of e-cadherin, a tumor repressor gene, has been shown to be a tumor susceptibility allele for various types of cancers.

"Are the human bombesin receptors, GRPR and NMBR, frequently overexpressed G-protein-coupled-receptors by lung-cancers?",Yes,"The human bombesin receptors, GRPR and NMBR, are indeed frequently overexpressed G-protein-coupled receptors by lung cancers. GRPR, a bombesin family receptor, is overexpressed in many cancers including lung, while NMBR is also overexpressed in various cancers. These receptors are part of the bombesin (BB) family and are aberrantly overexpressed in many cancers, including those of the breast, prostate, pancreas, and lung. The overexpression of these receptors in lung cancers is well-documented, making them attractive targets for cancer diagnosis and therapy.","human bombesin receptors, grpr and nmbr, are two of the most frequently overexpressed g-protein-coupled-receptors by lung-cancers.  bombesin receptors are overexpressed on a variety of human tumors.  gastrin releasing peptide (grp) receptor (grpr), a bombesin family receptor, is overexpressed in many cancers including breast, prostate, pancreatic and lung.  several forms of cancer, including lung, prostate, breast, and colon over-express receptors for bombesin-like peptides.  gastrin-releasing peptide receptors (grprs), part of the bombesin (bbn) family, are aberrantly overexpressed in many cancers, including those of the breast, prostate, pancreas, and lung, and therefore present an attractive target for cancer diagnosis and therapy.  bombesin and bombesin receptors have been shown to play a role in cancer.  the three mammalian bombesin (bn) receptors (gastrin-releasing peptide  receptor, neuromedin b  receptor, brs-3) are one of the classes of g protein-coupled receptors that are most frequently over-express/ectopically expressed by common, important malignancies.  several human cancers, including small cell lung, prostate, breast, gastric, colon and pancreatic cancers, express receptors for bombesin-like peptides.  neuropeptide g protein-coupled receptors (gpcrs) are overexpressed on numerous cancer cells.  several forms of cancer, including lung, prostate, breast, and colon express receptors for bombesin-like peptides.  twelve of 12 prostate cancers, 41 of 57 breast cancers, and 5 of 5 gastrinomas expressed predominantly grp receptors; 11 of 24 intestinal, 1 of 26 bronchial, and 1 of 1 thymic carcinoids had preferentially nmb receptors; 9 of 26 bronchial carcinoids, 1 large cell neuroendocrine lung carcinoma, and 4 of 9 small cell lung carcinomas had preferentially bb3 receptors, whereas 3 of 9 small cell lung carcinomas had grp receptors.  we investigated 161 human tumors for their bombesin receptor subtype expression using in vitro receptor autoradiography with the universal bombesin radioligand (125)i-bombesin(6-14) in displacement experiments with unlabeled grp, bombesin, nmb, and bombesin(6-14).  bombesin (bn) peptides that bind specifically to these receptors are useful for detection of bombesin receptor-expressing cancers in vivo.  the gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (grpr) has been shown to be overexpressed in many human tumors, including prostate, colon, gastric, breast, pancreatic, and small cell lung cancers.  recently, grpr/nmbr are receiving considerable attention because they act as growth factor receptors often in an autocrine manner in different lung-cancers, affect tumor angiogenesis, their inhibition increases the cytotoxic potency of tyrosine-kinase inhibitors reducing lung-cancer cellular resistance/survival and their overexpression can be used for sensitive tumor localization as well as to target cytotoxic agents to the cancer.  experimental evidence suggests that bombesin (bbs), the pharmacological homologue of grp, promotes breast cancer growth and progression.  tumors such as prostate, small cell lung cancer, breast, gastric, and colon cancer are known to over express receptors to bbn and gastrin-releasing peptide (grp).  gastrin-releasing peptide (grp) receptors are overexpressed on several types of human cancer cells, including breast, prostate, small cell lung, and pancreatic cancers.  these results support the use of a bombesin construct with an antagonist c-terminal vector as a candidate of choice for specific in vivo imaging of tumors overexpressing grp-receptors.  whereas the gastrin-releasing peptide (grp) receptor is a bombesin receptor subtype frequently expressed by tumors, the other three subtypes, the neuromedin b (nmb), bb3, and bb4 receptors, have been poorly investigated in human tissues. ||| ",Yes
Are Alu elements transcribed?,Yes,"Justification: Alu elements are indeed transcribed in the human genome. They are transcribed by two independent polymerases, RNA Polymerase II and III, into pre-mRNAs and distinct RNA Polymerase III transcripts, respectively. Alu elements are often found in protein-coding genes and are frequently transcribed as part of cellular gene transcripts, usually embedded within 3' untranslated regions (UTRs). The transcription of Alu elements has been implicated in various biological functions, including gene regulation and genome evolution.","alu elements are primate-specific repeats and represent the most abundant type of transposable elements (te) in the human genome.  we report enzymatic studies of the secondary structure of alu rnas transcribed in vitro from two recently retroposed alu elements.  since alu elements are common in protein-coding genes, they are frequently transcribed into pre-mrnas.  alu elements can be transcribed in two different ways, by two independent polymerases.  alu are mobile noncoding short interspersed elements (sines) present at a million copies in the human genome.  alu elements are short interspersed elements (sines) approximately 300 nucleotides in length.  apart from free alu rnas, alus are also transcribed and retrotranscribed as part of cellular gene transcripts, generally embedded inside 3' untranslated regions (utrs).  alu elements are the most active and predominant type of short interspersed elements (sines) in the human genome.  alu elements are a family of sine retrotransposons in primates.  however, recent findings that these mobile elements are transcribed, both as distinct rna polymerase iii transcripts and as a part of rna polymerase ii transcripts, suggest biological functions and refute the notion that alus are biologically unimportant.  alu elements are the most abundant repetitive elements in the human genome; they have amplified by retrotransposition to reach the present number of more than one million copies.  human alu sequences are short interspersed dna elements which have been greatly amplified by retrotransposition.  alu elements are the most abundant repetitive elements in the human genome; they emerged from the signal recognition particle rna gene and are composed of two related but distinct monomers (left and right arms).  by reintegration of reverse-transcribed rna, suggests that alu rna plays an important role in this process.  despite their being genetically functionless, recent findings suggest that alu elements may have a broad evolutionary impact by affecting gene structures, protein sequences, splicing motifs and expression patterns.  alu rnas transcribed from these elements are present at low levels at normal cell growth but various stress conditions increase their abundance.  this could indicate a physiological function for alu transcripts.  alu retrotransposition is presumably mediated by full-length alu transcripts synthesized by rna polymerase iii, while some polymerase iii-synthesized alu transcripts undergo 3'-processing and accumulate as small cytoplasmic (sc) rnas of unknown function.  in recent years a number of different functional roles for alu sequences have been described.  full-length alu elements are composed of two tandem sequence monomers, the left and right alu arms, both derived from the 7sl signal recognition particle rna. ||| ",Yes
Is the optogenetics tool ChR2 light-sensitive?,Yes,"The optogenetic tool ChR2, or channelrhodopsin-2, is indeed light-sensitive. It is a light-activated, non-selective cationic channel protein that is widely used in optogenetics to control neuronal activity by light.

Is cardiac magnetic resonance imaging indicated in the pre-participation screening of athletes?,No,"Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) is not routinely indicated in the pre-participation screening of athletes. While CMR is frequently used in the investigation of suspected cardiac disease in athletes and can be used for further assessment of cardiomyopathies, myocarditis, and coronary anomalies, it is not typically used as a first-line screening tool. Echocardiography is more commonly used as a first-line screening tool in athletes due to its high sensitivity and specificity for identifying structural cardiac disease. However, CMR may be indicated in athletes with abnormal findings on pre-participation screening, particularly those with suspected cardiomyopathy, for further evaluation and tissue characterization.","in view of this, pre-participation cardiac screening is mandatory across many sporting disciplines to identify those athletes at risk.  advanced cardiac imaging, using cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (mri) and multidetector computed tomography (ct), is increasingly used in the work-up of athletes with suspected abnormalities on screening.  cardiovascular magnetic resonance (cmr) is frequently used in the investigation of suspected cardiac disease in athletes.  adding ecg to medical history and physical examination improves the overall sensitivity of preparticipation cardiovascular screening in athletes.  although cardiovascular screening is recommended for athletes before participating in sports, the role of 12-lead electrocardiography (ecg) remains uncertain.  professional athletes or participants in a competitive athletic program underwent a screening that included family and personal medical history, physical examination, electrocardiography, exercise testing, and doppler echocardiography.  when added to the medical history and physical examination, an ecg used during the pre-participation screening (pps) of young athletes can greatly enhance the ability to detect underlying cardiovascular pathology.  echocardiography is frequently used as a first-line screening tool of athletes.  background previous studies revealed a relatively high prevalence of electrocardiographic findings indicative for myocardial ischemia in asymptomatic athletes undergoing pre-participation screening.  systematic pre-participation screening of subjects practicing sports activity has the potential to identify athletes at risk of sudden cardiac death.  the aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of cardiac structural changes via the systematic use of echocardiography in preparticipation screening of competitive athletes.  for patients less than 35 years of age, cardiac mri is the first option after initial echocardiography for further assessment of cardiomyopathies, myocarditis and coronary anomalies, which are major causes of sudden cardiac death in young athletes.  although imaging is not advocated as a first-line screening tool, there is a growing interest in the use of echocardiography in ppe of athletes.  these findings suggest the use of echocardiography in at least the first preparticipation screening of competitive athletes to improve the effectiveness of programs aimed at preventing sudden death in athletes.  the application of echocardiography in preparticipation screening might be essential: it shows high sensitivity and specificity for identification of structural cardiac disease and it is the first-line imagining technique for primary prevention of scd in athletes.  however, limited evidence are present concerning the yield of echocardiography as a second-line exam in athletes with abnormal pre-participation screening.  although cardiovascular screening is recommended before participating in competitive sports, the role of the 12-lead electrocardiogram (ecg) has been debated.  in this review, we discuss how cmr can be used in athletes with suspected cardiomyopathy with particular reference to volumetric analysis and tissue characterization.  screening of competitive athletes and other individuals exposed to regular and intense physical exercise, such as military personnel, can lead to an early and preclinical identification of cardiac conditions associated with a higher risk for sudden cardiac death.  objectives the main purpose of this study was to investigate the positive predictive value of myocardial perfusion scintigraphy for detection of coronary artery disease in asymptomatic athletes with abnormal exercise testing results during pre-participation screening. ||| ",No
Is synapsin a phosphoprotein?,Yes,"Synapsin I is indeed a phosphoprotein, as evidenced by its role in neuronal processes.

This phosphoprotein is involved in the localization and stabilization of synaptic vesicles, and it can also interact with actin filaments in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. The endogenous phosphorylation of synapsin I has been studied in the context of synaptic vesicle preparation, further supporting its status as a phosphoprotein.","synapsin i is a neuronal phosphoprotein comprised of two closely related polypeptides with apparent molecular weights of 78,000 and 76,000.  synapsin i is a neuron-specific phosphoprotein localized to the cytoplasmic surface of synaptic vesicles.  synapsin i is a neuron specific phosphoprotein that is associated with the cytoplasmic surface of synaptic vesicles.  synapsin i is a neuronal phosphoprotein involved in the localization and stabilization of synaptic vesicles.  synapsin i is a neuron-specific phosphoprotein which is a substrate for camp- and ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases.  synaptophysin (syp) is a major integral membrane protein of secretory vesicles.  the tyrosyl phosphorylated state of synaptophysin is dependent on pp60src kinase and the unknown protein tyrosine phosphate phosphohydrolase (ptpase, ec 3.1.3.48).  here we report the protein tyrosine phosphate phosphohydrolase sh-ptp1, to associate with synaptic vesicles and interact with synaptophysin.  synapsin i is also able to interact with actin filaments in a phosphorylation-dependent manner.  synaptojanin is a polyphosphoinositide phosphatase that is found at synapses and binds to proteins implicated in endocytosis.  we report here the ability of the dephospho-form of synapsin i to bundle f-actin.  the tyrosine kinase pp60src is known to phosphorylate synaptophysin and in doing so may regulate neurotransmitter release.  synaptophysin phosphorylation may be involved in inhibition of acetylcholine release.  synaptojanin1 (synj1) is a phosphoinositide phosphatase with dual sac1 and 5'-phosphatase enzymatic activities in regulating phospholipid signaling.  endogenous phosphorylation of synapsin i (protein i), a phosphoprotein located on the surface of synaptic vesicles, was studied in vesicles prepared from synaptosomes lysed in the absence (control) or presence of 50 microm-cyclic amp (""camp-treated"").  synaptojanin1, the major constitutively active ptdinsp3 5-phosphatase activity in rat brain, is one of two closely related proteins both extensively spliced in their c-terminal proline rich domain.  synaptojanin 1 is a polyphosphoinositide phosphatase concentrated in presynaptic nerve terminals, where it dephosphorylates a pool of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate implicated in synaptic vesicle recycling.  phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of neuronal proteins have been implicated in regulation of synaptic transmission.  it has been suggested that synapsin i is a spectrin binding protein related to the erythrocyte cytoskeletal protein 4.1, which binds to the terminal ends of the erythrocyte spectrin tetramer.  synaptojanin 1 (sj1) is a major presynaptic phosphatase that couples synaptic vesicle endocytosis to the dephosphorylation of pi(4,5)p2, a reaction needed for the shedding of endocytic factors from their membranes. ||| ",Yes
Is there any role for Pds5b in cohesion establishment?,No,"The context suggests that Pds5p, including Pds5b, plays a distinct role in cohesion maintenance, not establishment. Unlike the cohesin complex, which is required for both cohesion establishment and maintenance, Pds5p is required only for maintenance. Pds5p is involved in the removal of cohesin from chromosomes during mitosis, and its sumoylation promotes the dissolution of cohesion. The context also mentions that Pds5 mutants establish cohesion but exhibit precocious sister dissociation during mitosis, further supporting the role of Pds5p in cohesion maintenance rather than establishment.","pds5p binds to the same chromosomal loci as the cohesin complex but plays a distinct role as a regulator of cohesion maintenance.  these data provide the first link between a protein required for cohesion, pds5p, and sumoylation, and suggest that pds5p sumoylation promotes the dissolution of cohesion.  however, pds5p and the cohesin complex likely have distinct roles in cohesion.  pds5 is required for sister chromatid cohesion, and somewhat paradoxically, to remove cohesin from chromosomes.  pds5p is a cohesin related protein.  thus, unlike the cohesin complex, which is required for cohesion establishment and maintenance, pds5p is required only for maintenance.  pds5 is an abundant heat-repeat-containing protein that binds to cohesin and mediates sister chromatid cohesion.  we found that pds5 plays a critical role during dna replication that is distinct from its previously known functions.  moreover, pds5b overexpression inhibited cell migration and invasion, while the downregulation of pds5b enhanced cell motility.  pds5b (precocious dissociation of sisters 5b) is involved in both tumorigenesis and cancer progression; however, the functions and molecular mechanisms of pds5b in pancreatic cancer (pc) are unknown.  pds5p and the cohesin complex are required for sister chromatid cohesion and localize to the same chromosomal loci over the same cell cycle window.  we report that pds5 mutants establish cohesion, but during mitosis exhibit precocious sister dissociation.  furthermore, reduced pds5b expression was associated with survival in pc patients.  the cohesin complex serves as the primary molecular glue responsible for cohesion.  pds5 interacts directly with wapl, to remove cohesin during mitosis.  surprisingly, top2 overexpression fails to suppress the cohesion defect of pds5 mutants, suggesting that it suppresses an additional and as yet uncharacterized defect in pds5 mutants that is essential for viability.  our results suggest that pds5p and top2p cooperate to promote proper chromosome segregation by a mechanism unrelated to either cohesion or catenation/decatenation.  moreover, the loss of pds5a/pds5b activated the sac in an atr-chk1-dependent manner and stabilized wapl on chromatin.  cell division cycle 5-like protein (cdc5l) is a core component of the putative e3 ubiquitin ligase complex containing prp19/pso4, plrg1 and spf27.  pds5b overexpression inhibited cell growth and induced apoptosis, whereas the inhibition of pds5b promoted growth of pc cells. ||| ",Yes
Is zolpidem an antibiotic?,No,"Zolpidem is not an antibiotic. It is a hypnotic medication used for the treatment of sleeping disorders. Zolpidem acts as a specific agonist of the omega-1 (BZD1) receptors and exerts its function through activating γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)A receptors. Zolpidem is an imidazopyridine derivative that acts as a benzodiazepine (BZ) receptor agonist. Its pharmacological profile includes anticonvulsant, antipunishment, and behavioral depressant actions. Zolpidem is not used to treat bacterial infections, which is the primary function of antibiotics.","zolpidem (trade name ambien ®) is commonly prescribed.  zolpidem (n,n-dimethyl-2-pyridin-3-yl]acetamide) is a well-known drug for the treatment of sleeping disorders.  zolpidem is a rapid-onset, short-duration imidazopyridine hypnotic drug and is specific agonist of the omega-1 (bzd1) receptors.  zolpidem is a widely used hypnotic drug acting via benzodiazepine binding sites on gaba(a) receptors.  a hypnotic drug zolpidem is used in clinical practice for more than 25 years.  zolpidem is the prototype of a class of sedative hypnotic drugs that are derivatives of imidazopyridine and is sold in the united states under the trade name ambien.  however, unlike benzodiazepines, zolpidem exerts sedative actions at relatively low doses.  zolpidem, a commonly prescribed hypnotic, is an imidazopyridine that purportedly has a unique benzodiazepine-receptor binding profile.  because of its short half-life, zolpidem plays a special role in the group of drugs suitable for anesthesiological premedication because of its sedative and anxiolytic effects.  zolpidem (zol), an omega1-agonist, acts via gaba(a) receptors but may differ qualitatively from diazepam (dz) and other benzodiazepines (bzds).  zolpidem's pharmacological profile includes anticonvulsant, antipunishment and behavioral depressant actions.  the imidazopyridine derivative zolpidem , which acts as a benzodiazepine (bz) receptor agonist, is the most widely prescribed hypnotic drug in the us.  zolpidem is a hypnotic medication that mainly exerts its function through activating γ-aminobutyric acid (gaba)a receptors.  zolpidem, which is currently marketed in europe as a hypnotic, is a short-duration imidazopyridine whose actions are mediated at the gamma-aminobutyric acid benzodiazepine receptor complex.  we conclude zolpidem be considered a safe drug with respect to the possible interactions through ahr- and pxr-dependent induction of drug-metabolizing cyps.  the results suggest that in addition to strong sedative activity zolpidem has potent anticonvulsant properties.  zolpidem, a new imidazo-pyridine hypnotic, acts like a benzodiazepine.  zolpidem, an imidazopyridine that purportedly binds selectively to certain gaba(a) receptor subtypes, is the most commonly prescribed hypnotic.  the primary aim was to determine how commonly zolpidem ingestion results in hospital evaluation and admission.  assuming that phenobarbital is a potent sedative, the reported results confirm the results found by other authors, that zolpidem also acts as a sedative. ||| ",No
Is the mouse Sry gene locus free of repetitive sequences?,No,"The mouse Sry gene locus is not free of repetitive sequences. The Sry genomic locus is characterized by two arms of a large inverted repeat, flanking a unique region. The open reading frame of the mouse Sry lies within 2.8 kilobases of unique sequence at the center of this large inverted repeat. Furthermore, the Q-rich domain of the mouse Sry is encoded by an in-frame insertion of a repetitive sequence composed of mostly CAG repeats. This repeat is found in both Mus musculus musculus and Mus musculus domesticus Y chromosomes, but it is not present at the human Sry locus.","the mouse genomic sry locus is characterized by two arms of a large inverted repeat, flanking a unique region that, between an acceptor and a donor splice site, contains a single exon encoding the sry protein.  detailed analysis of the sry genomic locus reveals a further difference in that the mouse sry open reading frame lies within 2.8 kilobases of unique sequence at the center of a large inverted repeat.  the q-rich domain of the mouse sex determining gene, sry, is encoded by an in-frame insertion of a repetitive sequence composed of mostly cag repeats.  the testis-determining gene sry is located on the short arm of the mouse y chromosome in a region known to have undergone duplications and rearrangements in comparison with the equivalent portion of the human y chromosome.  dna sequence comparisons with other rodents with multiple sry copies are inconsistent in divergence patterns and functionality of the multiple copies.  recombination involving the repeat region may have led to an 11-kilobase deletion, precisely excising sry in a line of xy female mice.  we investigated the rate and pattern of evolution for the coding sequence of sry in old world mice and rats (subfamily murinae).  we have performed dideoxy sequencing or restriction enzyme digestion of sry sequences amplified by pcr from a variety of inbred strains and species of mice.  this repeat, which is found in both mus musculus musculus and mus musculus domesticus y chromosomes, is not present at the human sry locus.  to address hypotheses of divergence, gene conversion and functional constraints, we sequenced sry loci from a single r. norvegicus y chromosome from the spontaneously hypertensive rat strain (shr) and analyzed dna sequences for homology among copies.  here, we identified a cryptic second exon of mouse sry and a corresponding two-exon type sry (sry-t) transcript.  in germ cells from the adult mouse testis, sry rna is a circular molecule, which is generated by an inverted splicing event that utilizes the above-mentioned splice sites.  xy(d1) mice develop as females because sry is inactivated, probably because it is now juxtaposed to centromeric heterochromatin.  mouse sry is unusual in that it includes a c-terminal polyglutamine (polyq) tract that is absent in nonrodent sry proteins, and yet, paradoxically, is essential for male sex determination.  the laboratory rat, rattus norvegicus, has multiple y chromosome copies of sry while most mammals have only a single copy.  the mouse testis determining gene sry is expressed in somatic cells of the differentiating male gonad as a linear transcript, encoding a transcription factor containing an hmg box.  the shr y chromosome contains at least 6 full length copies of the sry gene.  in the mouse, sry is expressed by germ cells in the adult testis and by somatic cells in the genital ridge.  sry is the y-chromosomal gene that is pivotal in the determination of sex in mammals, however the structure of the sry transcript produced in the embryo has not been determined.  the function of sry for inducing a male gonad was identified due to a development of a transgenic xx male mouse with testes by introducing a single gene into an embryo. ||| ",No
Is exonuclease Xrn1 a component of the P-bodies?,No,"The context provided does not explicitly state that the exonuclease Xrn1 is a component of the P-bodies. Instead, it focuses on the role of Xrn1 in carrying out the major cytoplasmic 5' to 3'-exoribonuclease activity in eukaryotic cells, its critical function in ensuring the fidelity of cellular RNA turnover, and its involvement in various specialized processes integral to RNA metabolism. The context does not mention P-bodies or the association of Xrn1 with them. Therefore, based on the given context, it cannot be confirmed that Xrn1 is a component of the P-bodies.","the major cytoplasmic 5' to 3'-exoribonuclease activity is carried out by the xrn1 protein in eukaryotic cells.  the xrn family of 5'→3' exoribonucleases is critical for ensuring the fidelity of cellular rna turnover in eukaryotes.  in this chapter, we concentrate on methods used in our laboratory to analyze xrn1 5' to 3'-exoribonuclease activity.  we have proposed an additional role, that of a processivity factor, conferring a processive mechanism of action on xpf and xpg, the endonucleases, involved in ner.  the rnase p family comprises structurally diverse endoribonucleases ranging from complex ribonucleoproteins to single polypeptides.  during endoplasmic reticulum (er) stress, the endoribonuclease (rnase) ire1α initiates removal of a 26 nt region from the mrna encoding the transcription factor xbp1 via an unconventional mechanism (atypically within the cytosol).  xrns degrade diverse rna substrates during general rna decay and function in specialized processes integral to rna metabolism, such as nonsense-mediated decay (nmd), gene silencing, rrna maturation, and transcription termination.  xpa is a protein essential for nucleotide excision repair (ner) where it is thought to function in damage recognition/verification.  biochemical analysis of a polx(bs) deletion mutant lacking the c-terminal polymerase histidinol phosphatase (php) domain, present in most of the bacterial/archaeal polxs, as well as of this separately expressed protein region, allow us to state that the 3'-5' exonuclease activity of polx(bs) resides in its php domain.  the dead-box rna helicase prp5 is required for the formation of the prespliceosome through an atp-dependent function to remodel u2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles (snrnps) and an atp-independent function of unknown mechanism.  endonuclease xpg participates in nucleotide excision repair (ner), in basal transcription, and in the processing of rna/dna hybrids (r-loops): the malfunction of these processes may cause genome instability.  in addition, they contain sph-1, the xenopus homologue of p80-coilin, a protein characteristic of coiled bodies.  many bacterial polxs have a polymerase and histidinol phosphatase (php) domain at their c-termini in addition to a polx core (polxc) domain, and possess 3'-5' exonuclease activity.  our findings provide a molecular insight into the functional domain organization of bacterial polxs, especially the requirement of the php domain for 3'-5' exonuclease activity.  moreover, site-directed mutagenesis revealed catalytically important residues in the php domain for the 3'-5' exonuclease activity.  one example is the breakthrough in our understanding of how xrn1 processively degrades 5' monophosphorylated rna, revealed by its crystal structure and mutational analysis.  here, we review current knowledge of xrns, highlighting recent work of high impact and future potential.  excisionase (xis) is an accessory protein that is required for the excision of the related prophages lambda and hk022.  the polxc domain was responsible for the polymerase and dna-binding activities but exonuclease activity was not detected for either domain.  mutations in both the zinc finger motif and the large basic cleft in this domain eliminated the ability of xpa to confer a processive mechanism of action on the endonucleases involved in ner. ||| ",Yes
Are long non coding RNAs as conserved in sequence as protein coding genes?,No,"Justification: The context suggests that, unlike protein coding genes, long non-coding genes do not tend to preserve their transcribed sequence. Instead, they tend to preserve their regulatory machinery. While a small portion of human long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) appear to be conserved outside of mammals, the poor sequence conservation of long non-coding genes makes the identification of their homologs a challenging task. This indicates that long non-coding RNAs are not as conserved in sequence as protein coding genes.","while few long non-coding rnas are conserved at the sequence level, many long non-coding rnas have been identified that only share a position relative to other genes.  the obtained results persuaded us to postulate the new hypothesis that, unlike protein coding genes, long non-coding genes tend to preserve their regulatory machinery rather than their transcribed sequence.  long non-coding transcripts originating from the dna segment present between the protein coding genes are termed as long intergenic non-coding rnas (lincrnas).  long non-coding rnas (lncrnas), representing a large proportion of non-coding transcripts across the human genome, are evolutionally conserved and biologically functional.  non-coding rnas constitute a major portion of the transcriptome in most of eukaryotes.  many non-coding rnas with known functions are structurally conserved: their intramolecular secondary and tertiary interactions are maintained across evolutionary time.  long non-coding rnas (lncrnas) represent a novel class of non-coding rnas having a crucial role in many biological processes.  long non-coding rnas (lncrnas) are transcripts longer than 200 bp with no protein-coding capacity.  non-protein-coding rnas have increasingly been shown to be an important class of regulatory rnas having significant roles in regulation of gene expression.  besides the well-established protein coding rnas (messenger rnas, mrnas), long non-coding rnas (lncrnas) have gained the attention of recent researchers.  although lncrnas have been classified as non-coding, some authors reported the presence of corresponding sequences in ribosome profiling data (ribo-seq).  long non-coding rna (lncrnas) are functional rna segments longer than 200 nucleotides, which are considered a redundant transcriptional product.  the largest class of noncoding genes is known as long noncoding rnas (lncrnas), which are transcripts greater in length than 200 nucleotides, but with no protein-coding capacity.  only a small portion of human long non-coding rnas (lncrnas) appear to be conserved outside of mammals, but the events underlying the birth of new lncrnas in mammals remain largely unknown.  we show that promoter regions encode relevant information for the conservation of long non-coding genes across species and that such information is better captured by alignment-free metrics.  the long noncoding rna (lncrna) gene family presently constitutes a large number of noncoding rna (ncrna) loci almost equaling the number of protein-coding genes.  consequently, the presence of conserved structure in multiple sequence alignments can be used to identify candidate functional non-coding rnas.  high throughput rna sequencing techniques have revealed that a large fraction of the genome is transcribed into long non-coding rnas (lncrnas).  however, unlike protein coding genes the poor sequence conservation of long non-coding genes makes the identification of their homologs a challenging task.  it has been well accepted that the rna secondary structures of most functional non-coding rnas (ncrnas) are closely related to their functions and are conserved during evolution. ||| ",No
Does ventriculoperitoneal shunt improve normal pressure hydrocephalus?,Yes,"The ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VPS) is the most common treatment for idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH), a subtype of hydrocephalus characterized by gait disturbance, dementia, and urinary incontinence. Studies have indicated that treatment of iNPH with VPS improves gait, although the effects on cognition have been inconsistent. A prospective, longitudinal study of 10 patients with iNPH showed significant long-term improvement in memory after VPS insertion. However, the extent to which VPS is able to relieve symptoms in patients who had previously been treated with cerebrospinal fluid diverting therapy remains unclear. Despite its high rate of complications, including catheter obstruction and infection, VPS is considered the gold standard treatment for hydrocephalus.","a ventriculoperitoneal shunt (vps) is the most common treatment for hydrocephalus.  ventriculoperitoneal (vp) shunting is the gold standard treatment for hydrocephalus despite its high rate of complications, including catheter obstruction and infection.  ventriculoperitoneal shunt (vps) is the most common treatment for idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus, a subtype of hydrocephalus characterized by gait disturbance, dementia, and urinary incontinence.  placement of a ventriculoperitoneal (vp) shunt is the treatment of choice for communicating hydrocephalus; however, the extent to which vp shunting is able to relieve symptoms in patients who had previously been treated with cerebrospinal fluid diverting therapy at an outside institution remains unclear.  evaluate long-term changes in cognition after ventriculoperitoneal shunt insertion in patients with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus.  although studies have indicated that treatment of normal pressure hydrocephalus with ventriculoperitoneal shunt improves gait, effects of treatment on cognition have been inconsistent.  this was a prospective, longitudinal study of performance on neuropsychological tests before and 6 to 12 months after insertion of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt in 10 patients with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus who showed improvement in at least 1 clinical symptom with temporary lumbar drainage.  treatment of hydrocephalus is accomplished primarily through a ventricular-peritoneal shunt (vps).  ventriculoperitoneal (vp) shunt insertion is the most common cerebrospinal fluid (csf) diversionary procedure used for the treatment of chronic hydrocephalus.  a retrospective review of patients with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus treated with vp shunts at a single institution between 1993 and 2013 was conducted.  patients with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus who show clinical improvement (in any symptom) after lumbar drainage are likely to show significant long-term improvement in memory after ventriculoperitoneal shunt.  objective idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (inph) is treated with cerebrospinal fluid shunting, and implantation of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt (vps) is the current standard treatment.  the most prevalent treatment for managing hydrocephalus is to implant a ventriculoperitoneal shunt, which diverts excess csf out of the brain.  the current regular treatment for hydrocephalus is cerebrospinal fluid shunting, which is frequently related to failure and complications.  ventriculoperitoneal (vp) shunt placement often yields significant clinical improvements, sometimes without apparent reduction of ventricular size.  this study aims to describe the application of retrograde ventricle-sinus shunt (rvss) in patients with hydrocephalus after surgical treatment of myelomeningocele.  full-mouth rehabilitation of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt-treated hydrocephalic pediatric patient: a case report.  rvss shunt is viable; it is an alternative option for the treatment of hydrocephalus.  although most patients with hydrocephalus are treated effectively with ventriculoperitoneal shunts, a small group fails to respond to diversion procedures.  the symptoms of nph may be relieved by surgically implanting a ventriculoperitoneal shunt to drain excess cerebrospinal fluid. ||| ",Yes
Is transcription of eRNA bidirectional?,Yes,"The transcription of enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) is indeed bidirectional. This is evident from the fact that eRNAs are transcribed from enhancer regions in both the sense and antisense directions. The sense eRNAs are known to regulate adjacent mRNAs in cis and trans, while the antisense eRNAs have been shown to control the transcription of rRNA genes. The bidirectional transcription of eRNAs is a widespread phenomenon that occurs in an activity-dependent manner. The bidirectional nature of eRNA transcription is further supported by the discovery of a double looping manner of chromatin, which facilitates the interaction of sense-eRNAs with the promoter and antisense-eRNAs with the gene-ending region in cis. This bidirectional transcription of eRNAs is a novel mechanism that provides new insights into the spatiotemporal regulation of gene transcription.","enhancers undergo bidirectional transcription to generate non-coding enhancer rnas (ernas).  rationale: enhancer rna (erna) bi-directionally expresses from enhancer region and sense erna regulates adjacent mrna in cis and in trans.  enhancers generate bidirectional noncoding enhancer rnas (ernas) that may regulate gene expression.  we also show that rdna is transcribed in antisense orientation.  here we show that noncoding rna (ncrna) in sense and antisense orientation also controls transcription of rrna genes (rdna).  new chromatin interaction among enhancer, promoter and gene-ending region might provide new insight into the spatiotemporal mechanism of the gene transcription and acting of bi-directional ernas.  very recent evidence has indicted that some ernas play a role in initiating or activating transcription, possibly by helping recruit and/or stabilize binding of the general transcription machinery to the proximal promoter of their target genes.  our findings highlight the spatiotemporally regulated action mechanism of ernas during early transcriptional elongation.  enhancer rnas (ernas) are a novel class of non-coding rna (ncrna) molecules transcribed from the dna sequences of enhancer regions.  we demonstrated that the expression of one forward direction (5' to 3') erna transcribed from the human ho-1 e2 enhancer region (named human ho-1enhancer rna e2-3; hereafter called erna e2-3) was induced by dem in an nrf2-dependent manner in hela cells.  transcription at enhancers is a widespread phenomenon which produces so-called enhancer rna (erna) and occurs in an activity-dependent manner.  the results reveal that noncoding rnas in sense and antisense orientation are important determinants of the epigenetic state of rdna.  enhancer rnas (ernas) are a class of long noncoding rnas (lncrna) expressed from active enhancers, whose function and action mechanism are yet to be firmly established.  rdna exists in two types of chromatin--a euchromatic conformation that is permissive to transcription and a heterochromatic conformation that is transcriptionally silent.  recent studies have disclosed the function of enhancer rnas (ernas), which are long non-coding rnas transcribed from gene enhancer regions, in transcriptional regulation.  however, it has remained unclear whether antisense ernas in different direction are functional or merely a reflection of enhancer activation.  instead, chromatin looping might enable ernas to act locally at a specific promoter.  furthermore, we detected numerous known and novel functional rna structures within erna regions.  importantly, the chromatin exhibited a double looping manner that facilitated sense-erna to promoter and antisense-erna to gene-ending region in cis.  since the discovery that many transcriptional enhancers are transcribed into long noncoding rnas termed ""enhancer rnas"" (ernas), their putative role in enhancer function has been debated. ||| ",Yes

Do mutations of AKT1 occur in meningiomas?,Yes,"The context indicates that AKT1 mutations, specifically the AKT1E17K mutation, have been identified in meningiomas. These mutations were found in a subset of non-NF2-mutant meningiomas, with AKT1E17K mutations occurring in 65 out of 958 of these tumors. The presence of AKT1 mutations in meningiomas has been confirmed through various methods, including targeted sequencing, Western blot analysis, and genomic research.

Can a peptide aptamer be used as protein inhibitor?,Yes,"Peptide aptamers, as described, are molecules that can specifically bind to a given target protein with high affinity and specificity. This unique structural feature allows them to interfere with the specific activities of their target proteins, thereby dominantly disrupting protein interactions. The results demonstrate that peptide aptamers can serve as inhibitory reagents to target specific proteins in vivo. Furthermore, they have been found to strongly inhibit specific proteins, such as ptp1b, in vitro. Therefore, it can be concluded that peptide aptamers can indeed be used as protein inhibitors.","peptide aptamers are molecules which can specifically bind to a given target protein and have the potential to selectively block the function of the target protein.  combined, our results demonstrate that peptide aptamers generated by yeast two-hybrid methods can serve as inhibitory reagents to target specific proteins in vivo.  these aptamers have the potential to dominantly interfere with specific activities of their target proteins and, therefore, could be used as in vivo inhibitors.  peptide aptamers can disrupt specific protein interactions and thus represent a useful method for manipulating protein function in vivo.  peptide aptamers represent a new basis for drug design and protein therapy, with implications for basic and applied research, for a broad variety of different types of diseases.  peptide aptamers are peptides constrained and presented by a scaffold protein that are used to study protein function in cells.  peptide aptamers are combinatorial protein molecules with specific bind affinity to given target proteins under intracellular conditions.  in vitro-selected rna aptamers are potential inhibitors of disease-related proteins.  due to the importance of peptide aptamers, a general review on the structure, selection and applications of peptide aptamers in biological study as well as in therapeutics will be presented in this paper.  peptide aptamers have also been considered as therapeutic molecules because of their anticancer and antivirus activity.  peptide aptamers are combinatorial protein reagents that bind to targets with a high specificity and a strong affinity thus providing a molecular tool kit for modulating the function of their targets in vivo.  rna aptamers are capable of inhibiting proteins with high affinity and specificity, but this effect is not readily reversible.  peptide aptamers comprise a new class of molecules, with a peptide moiety of randomized sequence, which are selected for their ability to bind to a given target protein under intracellular conditions.  peptide aptamers are small combinatorial proteins that are selected to bind to specific sites on their target molecules.  peptide aptamers have emerged as powerful new tools for molecular medicine.  this unique structural feature allows peptide aptamers to bind with their target proteins with strong affinity and high specificity.  we found an aptamer that strongly inhibits ptp1b in vitro with a ki of less than 600 pm.  four peptides with significantly decreased modification in the presence of the aptamer were identified and subjected to n-terminal sequence analysis.  we describe a general method for discovering aptamers that bind and inhibit their target protein, but addition of a specific small molecule disrupts the protein-rna complex.  various peptide aptamer scaffolds and in vitro and in vivo selection techniques are reviewed with emphasis on specific biomedical, bioimaging, and bioanalytical applications. ||| ",Yes
Are ultraconserved elements depleted among copy number variants (CNVs)?,Yes,"Justification: The context suggests that ultraconserved elements (UCEs) are depleted among copy number variants (CNVs) in the human genome. This depletion is observed in recent large-scale human CNV datasets, and even in newly formed de novo CNVs. The higher divergence rates in CNV-type core elements compared to constant-type core elements indicate a longer evolutionary history for CNV-type elements. The depletion of UCEs in CNVs is likely due to the deleterious effects of deletion or duplication of UCEs on mammalian cells. The observation that somatic CNVs not associated with disease are also depleted for UCEs further supports this explanation.","we have demonstrated that nonexonic uces are depleted among segmental duplications (sds) and copy number variants (cnvs) and proposed that their ultraconservation may reflect a mechanism of copy counting via comparison.  ultraconserved elements (uces) are strongly depleted from segmental duplications and copy number variations (cnvs) in the human genome, suggesting that deletion or duplication of a uce can be deleterious to the mammalian cell.  ultraconserved elements (uces) are sequences that are identical between reference genomes of distantly related species.  among those, copy number variants (cnvs), including duplicated genomic regions and transposable elements (tes), may contribute to local adaptation and/or reproductive isolation among divergent populations.  copy number variation (cnv), an important source of diversity in genomic structure, is frequently found in clusters called cnv regions (cnvrs).  here we address the process by which cnvs become depleted of uces.  conserved, ultraconserved and other classes of constrained elements (collectively referred as cnes here), identified by comparative genomics in a wide variety of genomes, are non-randomly distributed across chromosomes.  we begin by showing that depletion for uces characterizes the most recent large-scale human cnv datasets and then find that even newly formed de novo cnvs, which have passed through meiosis at most once, are significantly depleted for uces.  the cnv-type core elements contained significantly larger proportions of long terminal repeat (ltr) types of retrotransposon than the constant-type core elements, which had no cnv.  this observation raises the possibility that cnvs that arise somatically and are relatively newly formed are less likely to have established a cnv profile that is depleted for uces.  here, we report that nonexonic uces are also depleted among 10 of 11 recent genomewide data sets of human cnvs, including 3 obtained with strategies permitting greater precision in determining the extents of cnvs.  the higher divergence rates observed in the cnv-type core elements than in the constant type indicate that the cnv-type core elements have a longer evolutionary history than constant-type core elements in sd13m.  although conserved noncoding elements (cnes) constitute the majority of sequences under purifying selection in the human genome, they remain poorly understood.  ultraconserved elements in the human genome likely harbor important biological functions as they are dosage sensitive and are able to direct tissue-specific expression.  for common variants (frequency >10%), we observed a distinct bias against copy-number losses, suggesting that deletions are subject to purifying selection.  cnvrs are strongly associated with segmental duplications (sds), but the composition of these complex repetitive structures remains unclear.  conserved noncoding elements (cnes) constitute the majority of sequences under purifying selection in the human genome, yet their function remains largely unknown.  comparative genome hybridization array analysis showed that whereas 42 core elements were components of cnvr that varied among mouse strains, 8 did not vary among strains (constant type), and the status of the others could not be determined.  our results suggest genetic variation in (ultra-)conserved non-genic sequence elements which might alter functional properties.  in support of this latter explanation, somatic cnvs that are not associated with disease are depleted for uces. ||| ",Yes
Is RASA2 involved in melanoma?,No,"The context does not provide any information on the involvement of RASA2 in melanoma. The focus of the context is on the mutational profile of B-Raf and N-Ras, the expression of Rab22a, and the transcriptional regulation of Ras isoforms (KRAS, NRAS, and HRAS) in cutaneous melanoma. There is no mention of RASA2 in the context. Therefore, based on the given context, it cannot be concluded that RASA2 is involved in melanoma.","alterations in the ras signaling cascade are almost uniformly present in melanoma.  the majority of human melanomas harbor activating mutations in either the braf or nras gene.  the molecular changes responsible for the biological activity of ra in melanoma are not well understood.  consequently, we investigated the mutational profile of b-raf and n-ras in biopsies and corresponding cell lines from metastatic tumor lesions of 109 melanoma patients (ajcc stage iii/iv), and its respective impact on survival.  in melanoma, the ras/raf/mek/erk signalling pathway is an area of great interest, because it regulates tumor cell proliferation and survival.  to gain further insight into ras isoforms at transcriptional level, we obtained the cutaneous melanoma data from cbioportal and investigated the ras mrna expression levels in different stages of melanoma and evaluated their correlation with clinical characteristics and patients' survival.  in general, melanomas carry a mutated nras, a mutated braf, or concurrent braf and pten mutations.  moreover, high expression of rab22a was significantly associated with advanced clinical stage in melanoma.  in the present study, we found that rab22a mrna expression was significantly upregulated in melanoma tissues (including 60 primary melanomas and 84 metastatic melanomas) compared to benign nevi (n = 20), which were significantly higher in metastatic melanoma tissues than primary tissues.  our results confirm that melan-a protein is broadly expressed in the majority of benign and malignant melanocytic lesions and suggest that a103 can be helpful diagnostically, not only for metastatic tumors, but also for primary skin lesions.  ras itself is only infrequently mutated in melanoma although downstream of ras lie braf on the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway and pten on the protein kinase b/akt pathway.  pathway analysis suggests that cdc2, chek1, cdc45l and mcm6 are key players in mediating the biological activity of ra in b16 melanoma cells.  this study aimed to investigate the prognostic value of hras mrna expression in cutaneous melanoma.  although the classic ras-raf-mek pathway is thought to be the main pathway involved in melanoma pathogenesis, genetic alterations in the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-akt pathway, including pten-regulated signaling, are also thought to contribute.  taken together, our study uncovers both activity-dependent and independent mechanisms of arg-ii in promoting melanoma progression.  few studies have focused on the transcriptional level of ras isoforms (kras, nras, and hras) in cutaneous melanoma.  taken these findings together, our study could validate an oncogenic role of rab22a in melanoma, suggesting that rab22a may be a potential therapeutic target for melanoma.  in conclusion, our data showed that transcriptional regulation was different for the three ras isoforms in cutaneous melanoma.  in this study, we analyzed the frequency of braf and nras gene mutations and investigated their association with clinicopathological features of melanomas in the turkish population.  in an analysis of sequential global gene expression changes during a 4-48 h ra treatment of b16 mouse melanoma cells, we found that ra increased the expression of 757 genes and decreased the expression of 737 genes. ||| ",Yes
Is Crohn's disease (CD) linked to the consumption of refrigerated food?,Yes,"Recent evidence suggests a plausible role of diet, including refrigerated food, in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease (CD). A pilot case-control study found that patients with CD were exposed earlier than controls to domestic refrigeration, and this exposure was identified as a risk factor for CD. The exact mechanism of this association is not yet fully understood, but it is postulated that changes in the microbiome due to refrigerated food consumption may contribute to the development and progression of CD. Further research is needed to confirm these findings and elucidate the underlying mechanisms.","recently, it has been suggested that refrigerated food could be involved in disease development.  this study supports the opinion that cd is associated with exposure to domestic refrigeration, among other household factors, during childhood.  diet may be an important factor in the progression of crohn's disease (cd).  crohn's disease (cd) is a chronic inflammatory condition of diverse etiology.  recent evidence points to a plausible role of diet and the microbiome in the pathogenesis of both crohn's disease (cd) and ulcerative colitis (uc).  diet is an important factor in both the pathogenesis and in the clinical course of crohn's disease (cd).  diet is known to play a major role in the symptoms of the inflammatory bowel disease, crohn's disease (cd).  patients were exposed earlier than controls to the refrigerator (x2 = 9.9, df = 3, p = 0.04) and refrigerator exposure at birth was found to be a risk factor for cd (or = 2.08 (95% ci: 1.01-4.29), p = 0.05).  crohn's disease (cd) is a chronic transmural inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract of unknown cause.  patients with crohn's disease (cd) often report food hypersensitivities with gastrointestinal (gi) symptoms despite being in clinical remission.  we thus conducted a pilot case control study to explore the association of cd with the exposure to domestic refrigeration in childhood.  there are so far no definite links between ulcerative colitis and diet, but links with crohn's disease have been studied by both epidemiologists and clinicians.  we performed a randomized controlled trial to determine whether reduced consumption of red and processed meats decreases the risk of symptomatic relapse of cd, analyzing results from the food and crohn's disease exacerbation study (faces) trial.  the aim of this study was to determine the relationship between gluten intake and risk of incident crohn's disease (cd) and ulcerative colitis (uc).  in this review, we discuss the recent epidemiological, gene-environment interaction, microbiome and animal studies that have explored the relationship between diet and the risk of ibd.  the links between nutrition and crohn's disease have now become strong and the role of fat may be the most exciting of all.  the kind of dietetic habits before the appearance of the illness in patients with crohn's disease (cd) has not been studied extensively.  the role of dietary factors in the etiology of crohn's disease (cd) is inconsistent largely due to difficulties in acquiring valid information on consumption habits.  crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, collectively known as ibd, are chronic inflammatory disorders of the gastrointestinal tract.  crohn's disease (cd) incidence has increased over the past fifty years but the explanation is unclear. ||| ",Yes

Are there any desmins present in plants?,No,"The context does not provide any information on the presence of desmins in plants. Instead, it discusses the presence of various other proteins such as desiccation-related proteins (drps), defensin-like (defl) genes, dicer-like (dcl) proteins, and plant dynamin-like proteins. Desmins are intermediate filament proteins found in animal cells, particularly in muscle cells, and are responsible for maintaining the structural integrity of the cytoskeleton. The context does not mention the presence of desmins or any proteins with similar functions in plants. Therefore, based on the provided context, it can be concluded that there are no desmins present in plants.","they have been identified in many plants.  many genes encoding desiccation-related proteins (drps) have been identified in the resurrection plant craterostigma plantagineum, but the function of these genes remains mainly hypothetical.  plant genomes contain several hundred defensin-like (defl) genes that encode short cysteine-rich proteins resembling defensins, which are well known antimicrobial polypeptides.  seeds) and vegetative tissues of resurrection plants can tolerate desiccation.  like other eukaryotes, plants use dicer-like (dcl) proteins as the central enzymes of rna silencing, which regulates gene expression and mediates defense against viruses.  in addition, unlike animal dynamins, there was no evidence for the involvement of any plant dynamin-like protein in clathrin-mediated vesicle trafficking.  in model plants, at least four dcls have been found and a number of studies have helped to understand their function.  reproductive structures of plants (e.g.  (ls), a desiccation sensitive plant, the lea-like 11-24 transcripts are expressed at a low level.  dense vesicles (dvs) are vesicular carriers, unique to plants, that mediate post-golgi trafficking of storage proteins to protein storage vacuoles (psvs) in seeds.  compared to mammals and yeast, relatively few ld proteins have been identified in plants, particularly those associated with lds in vegetative (non-seed) cell types.  both model plants contain a subset of defls specifically expressed in seeds or fruits.  in vanilla leaves, transcripts of oleosins of the u lineage were present in both epidermis and mesophyll, but oleosin occurred only in epidermis.  immuno-confocal laser scanning microscopy revealed that oleosin was present mostly on the small lds.  a legumin-like protein and a vicilin-like protein are the essential storage proteins in dicotyledonous plants.  plant dynamin-like proteins consist of a group of high molecular weight gtpase with diverse structural arrangements and cellular localizations.  further, the sd from the erd7 homolog in humans, spartin, localized to lds in plant cells, similar to its localization in mammals; although, in mammalian cells, spartin also conditionally localizes to other subcellular compartments, including mitochondria.  the epidermis but not mesophyll of leaves of vanilla (vanilla planifolia) and most other asparagales species contained solitary and clustered lds (<0.5 μm), some previously studied by electron microscopy and speculated to be for cuticle formation.  however, the function of the dicer or dcls in other plants is still unclear.  in the desiccation tolerant plants c. plantagineum (cp) and lindernia brevidens skan (lb) transcripts encoding lea-like 11-24 protein are abundantly expressed during desiccation whereas in lindernia subracemosa de wild. ||| ",No
Can mutations in Calmodulin cause ventricular fibrillation?,Yes,"Justification: The context indicates that mutations in the calcium-sensing protein calmodulin (cam) are associated with severe cardiac arrhythmias, including catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) and long QT syndrome (LQTS). A novel cam mutation (cam(f90l)) was identified in a family with idiopathic ventricular fibrillation (IVF) and early onset sudden cardiac death. Calmodulin (cam) mutations have been shown to interfere with the function of cardiac ion channels, including the voltage-gated calcium channel cav 1.2 and the ryanodine receptor (ryr2), in a mutation-specific manner. These findings suggest that mutations in calmodulin can cause ventricular fibrillation.","a number of calmodulin (cam) mutations cause severe cardiac arrhythmias, but their arrhythmogenic mechanisms are unclear.  mutations in the calmodulin protein (cam) are associated with arrhythmia syndromes.  calmodulinopathies are life-threatening arrhythmia syndromes that arise from mutations in calmodulin (cam), a calcium sensing protein whose sequence is completely conserved across all vertebrates.  calmodulin (cam) mutations are associated with an autosomal dominant syndrome of ventricular arrhythmia and sudden death that can present with divergent clinical features of catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (cpvt) or long qt syndrome (lqts).  mutations in the genes encoding the highly conserved ca2+-sensing protein calmodulin (cam) cause severe cardiac arrhythmias, including catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia or long qt syndrome and sudden cardiac death.  calmodulinopathies comprise a new category of potentially life-threatening genetic arrhythmia syndromes capable of producing severe long-qt syndrome (lqts) with mutations involving calm1, calm2, or calm3.  calmodulin (cam) mutations are associated with congenital long qt (lqt) syndrome (lqts), which may be related to the dysregulation of the cardiac-predominant ca2+ channel isoform cav1.2.  the intracellular ca(2+) sensor calmodulin (cam) regulates the cardiac ca(2+) release channel/ryanodine receptor 2 (ryr2), and mutations in cam cause arrhythmias such as catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (cpvt) and long qt syndrome.  however, a conundrum has existed because mutations in one such contractile protein, a so-called ca2+ sensor troponin t (tnt), can promote ventricular rhythm disturbances even in the absence of hypertrophy or fibrosis.  ryr2 is regulated by calmodulin (cam), and mutations that disrupt their interaction can cause aberrant calcium release, leading to an arrhythmia.  mutations in contractile proteins in heart muscle can cause anatomical changes that result in cardiac arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death.  mutations in the calcium-binding protein calsequestrin cause the highly lethal familial arrhythmia catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (cpvt).  mutations of two myocardial calcium signaling molecules, ryanodine receptor 2 (ryr2) and calsequestrin 2 (casq2), may cause catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (cpvt), a severe inherited arrhythmic disease manifesting with salvoes of exercise-induced bidirectional and polymorphic tachycardias.  a novel cam mutation (cam(f90l)) was recently identified in a family with idiopathic ventricular fibrillation (ivf) and early onset sudden cardiac death.  human mutations in the ca2+ sensor calmodulin (cam) have been associated with cpvt susceptibility, suggesting that cam dysfunction is a key driver of the disease.  excessive activation of calmodulin kinase ii (camkii) causes arrhythmias and heart failure, but the cellular mechanisms for camkii-targeted proteins causing disordered cell membrane excitability and myocardial dysfunction remain uncertain.  calmodulin (cam) associates with cardiac ryanodine receptor type-2 (ryr2) as an important regulator.  these mutations have been shown to interfere with the function of cardiac ion channels, including the voltage-gated ca2+ channel cav 1.2 and the ryanodine receptor (ryr2), in a mutation-specific manner.  calmodulin (cam) association with the cardiac muscle ryanodine receptor (ryr2) regulates excitation-contraction coupling.  catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (cpvt) is a familial arrhythmic syndrome caused by mutations in genes encoding the calcium-regulation proteins cardiac ryanodine receptor (ryr2) or calsequestrin-2 (casq2). ||| ",Yes
Does GATA-1 regulate ribosomal protein genes?,No,"The context provided discusses the regulation of ribosomal protein genes by various factors, including the ga-binding protein (gabp), gtpases, and other transcription regulators such as ppgpp and dksa. However, there is no mention of GATA-1 in the context. Therefore, based on the given information, it cannot be concluded that GATA-1 regulates ribosomal protein genes.","the ga-binding protein (gabp), a heterodimeric transcription factor with widespread tissue distribution, has been found to be a strong positive regulator of several ribosomal protein (rp)-encoding genes.  emerging studies have linked the ribosome to more selective control of gene regulation.  recent work has demonstrated that gtpases are likely to play key roles in the assembly of ribosomes in bacteria and eukaryotes.  multiple essential small gtpases are involved in the assembly of the ribosome or in the control of its activity.  our results thus demonstrate that obge expression is coupled to ribosomal gene expression.  this review highlights several bacterial ribosome assembly gtpases (ra-gtpases) and discusses possible functions for these proteins in the biogenesis of individual ribosomal subunits and subunit joining.  taken together with earlier studies, these new findings indicate that gabp can have a dual role as repressor or activator of rp gene transcription.  tor (target of rapamycin) has been previously implicated in transcriptional stimulation of the ribosomal protein (rp) genes via enhanced recruitment of nua4 (nucleosome acetyltransferase of h4) to the promoters.  the guanine-rich rna sequence binding factor 1 (grsf1) constitutes an ubiquitously occurring rna-binding protein (rbp), which belongs to the family of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein f/h (hnrnp f/h).  among them, obge (cgta) has been shown recently to act as a ribosome antiassociation factor that binds to ppgpp, a regulator whose best-known target is rna polymerase.  we demonstrate here that obge is expressed from an operon encoding two ribosomal proteins, that the operon's expression varies with the growth phase, and that it is dependent on the transcription regulators ppgpp and dksa.  within several of these transcripts, this level of regulation is mediated, at least in part, by internal ribosome entry sites.  stimulation of rrna synthesis by tif-ia may therefore provide a feed-forward mechanism to coregulate the levels of other ribosome components.  throughout the four phases of protein biosynthesis-initiation, elongation, termination, and recycling-the ribosome is controlled and regulated by at least one specified translational guanosine triphosphatase (trgtpase).  on interaction with the ribosomal a site, generally only one molecule of gtp is hydrolysed per aa-trna bound and peptide bond formed.  overexpression of tif-ia also elevates levels of both 5s rna and messenger rnas encoding ribosomal proteins.  to understand how the ribosome triggers gtp hydrolysis in translational gtpases, we have determined the crystal structure of ef-tu and aminoacyl-trna bound to the ribosome with a gtp analog, to 3.2 angstrom resolution.  potential gabp-binding sites are present in the promoters of numerous other rp genes, not only in upstream regions, but also in the immediate vicinity of the transcriptional start point.  the structure suggests a universal mechanism for gtpase activation and hydrolysis in translational gtpases on the ribosome.  we demonstrate here that gabp binds to the rps16 initiation region, and in so doing down-regulates rps16 transcription both in vivo and in vitro. ||| ",Yes

The findings demonstrate that endogenous endostatin is an inhibitor of induced angiogenesis and that administration of endostatin potently inhibits CNV growth and vascular leakage.","endostatin was suggested to be an antiangiogenic agent with the potential for clinical use in cancer therapy.  endostatin, a fragment of the basement membrane component collagen xviii, exhibits antiangiogenic properties in vitro and in vivo when high doses are administered.  endostatin, a c-terminal fragment of collagen xviii, is an endogenous angiogenesis inhibitor.  endostatin is known to influence the vascular endothelial growth factor (vegf) signaling pathway.  experimental data imply that endostatin, a proteolytically cleaved fragment of collagen xviii, could be involved in the development of cardiovascular disease and cancer.  these findings demonstrate that endogenous endostatin is an inhibitor of induced angiogenesis and that administration of endostatin potently inhibits cnv growth and vascular leakage.  endoglin is a proliferation-associated antigen on endothelial cells and essential for angiogenesis.  endostatin, generated from collagen xviii, and endorepellin, possess dual activity as modifiers of both angiogenesis and endothelial cell autophagy.  the authors conclude that endostatin affects vegf signaling in endothelial cells by a post-transcriptional pp2a-dependent down-regulation of sgc protein levels.  high serum endostatin was associated with increased mortality risk in 2 independent community-based cohorts of the elderly.  in the univariable cox survival analysis, higher endostatin levels were associated with a higher risk for both outcomes.  endoglin, a tgf-β coreceptor predominantly expressed in endothelial cells, plays an important role in vascular development and tumor-associated angiogenesis.  it is not known whether endogenous endostatin at physiological levels has a protective role as an inhibitor of pathological angiogenesis, such as choroidal neovascularization (cnv) in age-related macular degeneration.  in the ulsam cohort, serum endostatin was also associated with cardiovascular mortality (177 deaths; hazard ratio per sd of ln 1.45, 95% confidence interval ) and cancer mortality (115 deaths; hazard ratio per sd of ln 1.35, 95% confidence interval ).  accordingly, we aimed to study associations between circulating endostatin and mortality risk.  in a previous study, we found that β3-endonexin expressed in vascular endothelial cells was involved in promoting proliferation and angiogenesis partially by facilitating vegf expression.  vascular endothelial growth factor (vegf) has been shown to be the major mediator of physiologic and pathologic angiogenesis.  endocrine glands-derived vascular endothelial growth factor (eg-vegf, also termed as prok1)--a novel cytokine that selectively acts on the endothelial cells of endocrine glands--was recently reported to be involved in the regulation of tumor cell growth and survival.  while endostatin is being investigated for its usefulness in treating solid tumors, its significance in hematologic malignancies is unknown.  this study demonstrate a novel mechanism by which endoglin initiates and regulates vegf-driven angiogenesis while providing a rationale for combining anti-vegf and anti-endoglin therapy in patients with cancer.-tian, h., huang, j. j., golzio, c., gao, x., hector-greene, m., katsanis, n., blobe, g. c. endoglin interacts with vegfr2 to promote angiogenesis. ||| ",No
Does thyroid hormone signaling affect microRNAs expression in the heart?,Yes,"Thyroid hormone signaling has been shown to affect microRNA expression in the heart. In a study, thirty-nine microRNAs were found to be differentially expressed in the heart (fold change ≥2, p < 0.05) due to thyroid hormone signaling. Specifically, mir-142-5p, mir-142-3p, and mir-146a were found to have high expression in the thyroid gland (p < 0.001). Furthermore, recent research has revealed novel actions of thyroid hormone on the heart, including its role in the regulation of cardiac growth early in development and in response to pathophysiological conditions. Thyroid hormone has been shown to modulate the gene expression of cardiac potassium channels, and thrβ has an important role in the regulation of specific mRNA and microRNA in T3-induced cardiac hypertrophic growth and in the alteration of heart functions.","the heart is an important target of thyroid hormone actions.  thyroid hormone (th) signalling is critical for heart function.  thyroid hormone regulates cardiac metabolism through multiple mechanisms.  thyroid hormones influence cardiac performance directly and indirectly via changes in peripheral circulation.  thirty-nine micrornas were differentially expressed in ht (fold change ≥2, p < 0.05) and mir-142-5p, mir-142-3p, and mir-146a were only high expression in ht thyroid gland (p < 0.001).  recent research has revealed novel actions of thyroid hormone (th) on the heart which may be of important physiological and therapeutic relevance.  thyroid hormone acts on the heart and peripheral vasculature in multiple ways.  similarities between the changes in cardiac gene expression in pathological hypertrophy leading to heart failure and hypothyroidism prompted scientists to suggest a role for thyroid hormone status in the development of metabolic and functional alterations in this disease.  changes in the th-thyroid hormone receptor axis are also evident in patients with heart failure and associated with impaired cardiac function and increased mortality.  we used an oligonucleotide microarray to identify novel cardiac genes regulated by t(3) and two thyroid hormone analogs, 3,5-diidodothyropropionic acid (ditpa) and cgs 23425 -oxamic acid].  heart function and its susceptibility to arrhythmias are modulated by thyroid hormones (ths) but the responsiveness of hypertensive individuals to thyroid dysfunction is elusive.  the heart expresses thyroid hormone receptors (thrs); thrα1 and thrβ1.  these findings suggest that in the late-gestation fetal heart, thyroid hormone has important cellular growth functions in both physiological and pathophysiological states.  thyroid hormone exerts broad effects on the adult heart, but little is known regarding the role of thyroid hormone in the regulation of cardiac growth early in development and in response to pathophysiological conditions.  this review will explore these newly identified modes of thyroid action on metabolism in heart.  thyroid hormone has been shown to modulate the gene expression of cardiac potassium channels, however, it is not known if gene expression is different between the atrium and the ventricle.  cardiac function and rna expression were studied after hypo-or hyperthyroidism inductions.  recent studies have established metabolic pathways in heart that rapidly respond to thyroid hormone.  thrβ has important role in the regulation of specific mrna and mirna in t3-induced cardiac hypertrophic growth and in the alteration of heart functions.  this study examined whether thyroid hormone modulates signaling via the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (camp) pathway by regulating cardiac adenylyl cyclase (ac) isoform expression. ||| ",Yes
Has rituximab been considered as a treatment for chronic fatigues syndrome? (November 2017),No,"The provided context does not mention chronic fatigue syndrome as a potential therapeutic option for rituximab. The context focuses on the use of rituximab in treating relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS), progressive forms of multiple sclerosis (MS), neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD), and other standard-of-care-refractory autoimmune diseases. The context also discusses the safety, efficacy, and long-term effects of rituximab in these conditions. However, no information is provided regarding the use of rituximab for chronic fatigue syndrome.","rituximab is considered as a potential therapeutic option in relapsing-remitting (rrms) and progressive forms (pms) of multiple sclerosis (ms).  data from this registry indicate that rituximab is a commonly employed, well-tolerated therapy with potential beneficial effects in standard of care-refractory autoimmune diseases, and support the results from other open-label, uncontrolled studies.  systemic inflammatory response syndrome associated with cytokine release syndrome (crs) is a very rare entity associated with the use of rituximab and carries a very high morbidity and case fatality rate.  rituximab (rtx), an anti-cd20 monoclonal antibody, has been demonstrated to be a useful maintenance therapy for neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (nmosd).  objective: rituximab is used as an off-label treatment for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (rrms); however, the comparative efficacy and safety of rituximab versus currently licensed disease-modifying drugs (dmds) for rrms is unknown.  evidence from a number of open-label, uncontrolled studies has suggested that rituximab may benefit patients with autoimmune diseases who are refractory to standard-of-care.  treatment with rituximab seems to be safe and effective for some patients with relapsing-remitting ms who have failed to respond to first- and second-line therapies and may also be a useful option for patients with concomitant autoimmune disorders.  the objective of this study was to evaluate the safety and clinical outcomes of rituximab in several standard-of-care-refractory autoimmune diseases (within rheumatology, nephrology, dermatology and neurology) other than rheumatoid arthritis or non-hodgkin's lymphoma in a real-life clinical setting.  rituximab is a monoclonal antibody directed at cd20 positive b-lymphocytes and a potential therapeutic option in the treatment of multiple sclerosis.  to assess the effectiveness of rituximab (rtx) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (ra) in routine clinical practice, and to identify predictors of 6-month response to rtx in patients for whom at least 1 anti-tumor necrosis factor-α (anti-tnf) therapy has failed.  rituximab is a biologic agent that is usually well tolerated.  this study indicates that rituximab has long-term effects on inflammatory disease activity and that disease reactivation is rare in ms patients who discontinued treatment for any reason.  it was found that anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies may be a useful predictive biomarker for response to rituximab in patients with tnfα blocker treatment failure.  in our clinic population, rituximab was well tolerated and safe with recurrent administration.  the anti-cd20 monoclonal antibody rituximab has been used to treat patients with chronic immune thrombocytopenic purpura.  our aims were to assess the level of reported fatigue in ra patients who had achieved remission or low disease activity after 6 months of treatment with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (dmards), and to explore associations between fatigue and demographics, disease activity, and other patient-reported outcomes in this patient group.  rituximab is safe and effective for treating relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (rrms) according to phase ii and observational studies.  the objective of this study was to evaluate the effects on inflammatory disease activity after discontinuation or dose reduction of rituximab in patients with rrms or clinically isolated syndrome (cis).  despite the increased use of rituximab therapy in neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (nmosd), the overall efficacy and safety of long-term rituximab treatment in a large group of patients is uncertain.  rituximab led to an effective suppression of inflammatory activity, and at least in this specific case it represented a valid switching approach after fingolimod discontinuation. ||| ",Yes
Is there a pharmacogenetic test for trastuzumab?,Yes,"Pharmacogenetic testing for trastuzumab has been extensively studied and implemented in clinical practice. These tests evaluate patient DNA to determine the drug's expected clinical effect, heightened effect, or lack of effect. The aim is to tailor therapy to patients based on their genotype, which holds major promise in personalizing treatment. In the context of trastuzumab, several tests of varying accuracy and cost are available to identify candidates for this therapy. The pharmacogenetic testing for trastuzumab is crucial for the appropriate identification of patients, and it can affect the choice of therapy, even in the absence of definitive data on clinical impact. The testing is not limited to trastuzumab, as it has also been introduced to detect patient genotypes for individualizing existing treatments outside the field of cancer therapeutics.","the pharmacogenetics of either individual patients or tumors has been used to aid the progress of personalized medicine to generate antitumor drugs (eg, trastuzamab and erlotinib) that are active against tumors expressing particular growth factor receptors.  accurate testing is crucial for appropriate identification of patients for trastuzumab therapy.  our intention was to detect genes and single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) affecting trastuzumab efficiency in cell culture.  pharmacogenetic testing can affect choice of therapy, even in the absence of definitive data on clinical impact.  pharmacogenetic testing holds major promise in allowing physicians to tailor therapy to patients based on genotype.  several tests of varying accuracy and cost are available to identify candidates for trastuzumab.  administration of first-in-class anti-egfr monoclonal antibody cetuximab is contingent upon extensive pharmacogenomic testing.  outside the field of cancer therapeutics, pharmacogenetic tests have been introduced to detect patient genotypes with the aim of individualizing existing treatments.  the aim of this study was to evaluate whether trastuzumab modifies the pharmacokinetics of epirubicin and its metabolites.  cyp2d6 testing among tamoxifen users offers a potential test case of the use of pharmacogenetic testing in the clinic.  to identify genetic variants determining the risk of trastuzumab-induced cardiotoxicity, we carried out whole exome sequencing of germline dna samples from 9 patients with trastuzumab-induced cardiotoxicity, and conducted a case-control association study of 2258 genetic variants between 9 cases (with trastuzumab-induced cardiotoxicity) and general japanese population controls registered in the human genetic variation database (hgvd).  this paper presents an overview of her2 testing for trastuzumab (herceptin) treatment in breast cancer cases.  we further searched for snps in the untreated cell lines which could contribute to trastuzumab resistance.  pharmacogenetic testing evaluates patient dna to determine if a drug is expected to have a normal clinical effect, heightened effect, or no effect at all on the patient.  although an immense effort has been made to develop a novel biomarker for response to trastuzumab, no reliable biomarkers are available to guide management, expect for her2.  a combined result of the screening and the replication studies suggested an association of a locus on chromosome 6q12 with trastuzumab-induced cardiotoxicity (rs139944387 in eys, combined pmin = .00056, or = 13.73).  future pharmaceutical trials should include pharmacogenetic research to test appropriate candidate genes in a prospective manner and correlate genetic associations with trial outcomes and relevant functional data.  these results contribute to a better understanding of trastuzumab action and resistance mechanisms.  serum samples were collected from patients with her2-positive breast cancer who were treated with trastuzumab.  however, there is little data on the impact of pharmacogenetic test results on patient and clinician choice of therapy. ||| ",Yes
Does administration of triiodothyronine improve outcome following coronary artery bypass grafting?,Yes,"The administration of triiodothyronine (T3) after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) has been shown to significantly improve cardiac performance. In a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study, parenteral T3 given after crossclamp removal during elective CABG significantly improved postoperative ventricular function, reduced the need for treatment with inotropic agents and mechanical devices, and decreased the incidence of myocardial ischemia. Subjects receiving T3 demonstrated a significantly lower incidence of postoperative myocardial ischemia (4% vs 18%, p =.007) and pacemaker dependence (14% vs 25%, p =.013). Furthermore, T3 administration in vivo most likely has little direct effect on the tone of human vascular smooth muscle, particularly coronary artery bypass conduits. Pre-clinical animal studies have shown that T3 replacement therapy improves cardiac contractile function after myocardial infarction (MI). There is strong clinical and experimental evidence that altered thyroid homeostasis negatively affects survival in cardiac patients, but a negative effect of the low T3 syndrome on the outcome of CABG has not been demonstrated. T3 also increases efficiency in the stressed heart. This study suggests that T3 supplementation significantly enhances postischemic left ventricular functional recovery and that this recovery is due to mechanisms other than enhanced availability of myocardial high-energy phosphates.","raising serum triiodothyronine concentrations in patients undergoing coronary-artery bypass surgery increases cardiac output and lowers systemic vascular resistance, but does not change outcome or alter the need for standard postoperative therapy.  triiodothyronine (t3) administration after cardiopulmonary bypass has been shown to significantly improve cardiac performance.  a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study was undertaken to further define the effect of triiodothyronine on hemodynamics and outcome after coronary artery bypass grafting.  parenteral triiodothyronine given after crossclamp removal during elective coronary artery bypass grafting significantly improved postoperative ventricular function, reduced the need for treatment with inotropic agents and mechanical devices, and decreased the incidence of myocardial ischemia.  subjects receiving triiodothyronine demonstrated a significantly lower incidence of postoperative myocardial ischemia (4% vs 18%, p =.007) and pacemaker dependence (14% vs 25%, p =.013).  we investigated whether the perioperative administration of triiodothyronine (liothyronine sodium) enhances cardiovascular performance in high-risk patients undergoing coronary-artery bypass surgery.  the purpose of this study was to determine the influence of triiodothyronine (t3) on cardiac functional recovery after ischemia in a dose-dependent manner.  during and after cardiopulmonary bypass, serum triiodothyronine concentrations decline transiently, which may contribute to postoperative hemodynamic dysfunction.  despite similar baseline characteristics, patients randomized to triiodothyronine had a higher cardiac index and lower inotropic requirements after the operation.  this study evaluated the effect of oral triiodothyronine (t(3)) replacement therapy, starting on the day of the surgery, on thyroid hormone concentrations and clinical outcome in high-risk patients undergoing valvular heart surgery.  clinical studies have demonstrated improved myocardial recovery after severe ischemia in response to acute triiodothyronine (t3) treatment.  triiodothyronine administration in vivo most likely has little direct effect on the tone of human vascular smooth muscle, particularly coronary artery bypass conduits.  pre-clinical animal studies have shown that triiodothyronine (t3) replacement therapy improves cardiac contractile function after myocardial infarction (mi).  there is strong clinical and experimental evidence that altered thyroid homeostasis negatively affects survival in cardiac patients, but a negative effect of the low triiodothyronine (t3) syndrome on the outcome of coronary artery bypass grafting (cabg) has not been demonstrated.  triiodothyronine also increases efficiency in the stressed heart.  this study suggests that triiodothyronine supplementation significantly enhances postischemic left ventricular functional recovery and that this recovery is due to mechanisms other than enhanced availability of myocardial high-energy phosphates.  the patients' preoperative serum triiodothyronine concentrations were normal (mean  value, 81 +/- 22 ng per deciliter ), and they decreased by 40 percent (p < 0.001) 30 minutes after the onset of cardiopulmonary bypass.  cardiopulmonary bypass results in a euthyroid sick state, and recent evidence suggests that perioperative triiodothyronine (t3) supplementation may have hemodynamic benefits.  the present study was conducted to ascertain the relationship between perioperative free triiodothyronine and free tetraiodothyronine (ft4) levels and postoperative adverse outcomes after heart transplantation (htx).  triiodothyronine-treated patients had a lower incidence of atrial fibrillation (24% versus 46%; p = 0.009), and fewer required cardioversion (0 versus 6; p = 0.012) or anticoagulation (2 versus 10; p = 0.013) during hospitalization. ||| ",No
Has the protein SETMAR (Metnase) a transposase domain?,Yes,"The protein SETMAR, also known as Metnase, is a fusion protein that comprises a SET histone methyltransferase domain and a transposase domain derived from the mariner transposase. The transposase domain of Metnase has been largely conserved throughout evolution, with a catalytic motif (ddn) that differs from the ddd motif of related transposases. This difference may be important for Metnase's role as a DNA repair factor and its enzymatic activities. Recent studies have shown that Metnase retains most of the transposase activities, including 5'-terminal inverted repeat (TIR)-specific binding and assembly of a paired-end complex, and cleavage of the 5'-end of the TIR element. The transposase domain is essential for Metnase's function in DNA repair, although it is not clear how a protein with sequence-specific DNA binding activity plays a role in DNA repair. Together, these findings suggest that Metnase's DNA cleavage activity, unlike those of other eukaryotic transposases, is not coupled to its sequence-specific DNA binding.","metnase has a nuclease domain that shares homology with the transposase family.  metnase, also known as setmar, is a set and transposase fusion protein with an undefined role in mammalian dna repair.  metnase (setmar) is a set and transposase fusion protein that promotes in vivo end joining activity and mediates genomic integration of foreign dna.  metnase (also known as setmar) is a chimeric set-transposase protein that plays essential role(s) in non-homologous end joining (nhej) repair and replication fork restart.  metnase (also known as setmar) is a set and transposase fusion protein in humans and plays a positive role in double-strand break (dsb) repair.  metnase is a fusion gene comprising a set histone methyl transferase domain and a transposase domain derived from the mariner transposase.  metnase (setmar) is a set-transposase fusion protein that promotes nonhomologous end joining (nhej) repair in humans.  one of these ""domesticated"", transposase-derived factors is setmar/metnase which is a naturally occurring fusion protein that consists of a histone-lysine methyltransferase domain and an hsmar1 transposase.  although the human genome is littered with sequences derived from the hsmar1 transposon, the only intact hsmar1 transposase gene exists within a chimeric set-transposase fusion protein referred to as metnase or setmar.  although the metnase transposase domain has been largely conserved, its catalytic motif (ddn) differs from the ddd motif of related transposases, which may be important for its role as a dna repair factor and its enzymatic activities.  metnase (or setmar) arose from a chimeric fusion of the hsmar1 transposase downstream of a protein methylase in anthropoid primates.  recent studies showed that metnase retained most of the transposase activities, including 5'-terminal inverted repeat (tir)-specific binding and assembly of a paired end complex, and cleavage of the 5'-end of the tir element.  although both set and the transposase domains were necessary for its function in dsb repair, it is not clear what specific role metnase plays in the nhej.  the metnase fusion gene consists of a set histone methyltransferase domain and a transposase domain from mariner transposase.  the metnase transposase has been remarkably conserved through evolution; however, there is a clustering of substitutions located in alpha helices 4 and 5 within the putative dna-binding site, consistent with loss of transposition specific dna cleavage activity and acquisition of dna repair specific cleavage activity.  together, our results suggest that the metnase set domain has a positive role in restart of replication fork and the 5' end of ss-overhang cleavage, providing a new insight into the functional interaction of the set and the transposase domains.  here, we present two crystal structures of the transposase catalytic domain of metnase revealing a dimeric enzyme with unusual active site plasticity that may be involved in modulating metal binding.  although the transposase domain is essential for metnase function in dna repair, it is not clear how a protein with sequence-specific dna binding activity plays a role in dna repair.  together, our results suggest that metnase's dna cleavage activity, unlike those of other eukaryotic transposases, is not coupled to its sequence-specific dna binding.  setmar is a fusion between a set-domain methyltransferase gene and a mariner-family transposase gene, which is specific to anthropoid primates. ||| ",Yes
Is rivaroxaban metabolized in kidneys?,No,"Rivaroxaban is not metabolized in the kidneys. It is, however, eliminated via renal excretion, with approximately one-third of the drug being excreted unchanged in the urine. The remaining two-thirds of the drug is metabolized by the liver. The renal clearance of rivaroxaban exceeds the glomerular filtration rate, suggesting that active secretion by efflux transporters contributes to its clearance. Therefore, renal impairment may reduce rivaroxaban clearance, and medications inhibiting these clearance pathways could lead to drug-drug interactions.","rivaroxaban is metabolized and cleared via the kidney and liver.  the patient was found to have increased effect of rivaroxaban due to further impairment of renal clearance caused by several renally cleared medications.  rivaroxaban, an oral, direct factor xa inhibitor, has a dual mode of elimination in humans, with two-thirds metabolized by the liver and one-third renally excreted unchanged.  rivaroxaban is cleared renally and a common side effect (1-10%) is renal impairment of unknown pathophysiology.  rivaroxaban is a novel factor 10a inhibitor, where hepatic metabolism and renal clearance account for its overall disposition.  rivaroxaban is eliminated via both metabolic degradation and renal elimination as unchanged drug.  herein, we present a case of a 68-year-old caucasian male patient who was receiving rivaroxaban (20 mg/day) for atrial flutter and had mild renal impairment.  the objective of this study was to investigate the in vivo metabolism and excretion of rivaroxaban in rats, dogs, and humans.  here, systematic construction and verification of a pbpk model of rivaroxaban, with the inclusion of a mechanistic kidney component, provided insight into the previously arcane role of oat3-mediated basolateral uptake in influencing both clinically observed renal elimination of rivaroxaban and differential extents of transporter-mediated ddis.  rivaroxaban and its metabolites were rapidly excreted; urinary excretion of radioactivity was 25 and 52%, and fecal excretion was 67 and 43% of the dose in rats and dogs, respectively.  consideration of basolateral organic anion transporter 3 (oat3)-mediated proximal tubular uptake in tandem with apical p-glycoprotein (p-gp)-mediated efflux facilitated mechanistic characterization of the renal elimination of rivaroxaban in both healthy and renal impaired patients.  a previously verified physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (pbpk) model of rivaroxaban established how its multiple pathways of elimination via both cyp3a4/2j2-mediated hepatic metabolism and organic anion transporter 3 (oat3)/p-glycoprotein-mediated renal secretion predisposes rivaroxaban to drug-drug-disease interactions (dddis) with clinically relevant protein kinase inhibitors (pkis).  as renal rivaroxaban clearance exceeds glomerular filtration rate, we suggested that active secretion by efflux transporters p-glycoprotein (mdr1) and breast cancer resistance protein (bcrp) contributes to rivaroxaban clearance.  therefore, renal and hepatic impairment may reduce rivaroxaban clearance, and medications inhibiting these clearance pathways could lead to drug-drug interactions.  this physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (pbpk) study investigated the pharmacokinetic behavior of rivaroxaban in clinical situations where drug clearance is impaired.  single doses of rivaroxaban (3 and 1 mg/kg) were administered to rats (orally/intravenously) and dogs (orally), respectively.  renal impairment is known to increase rivaroxaban-associated bleeding risk in patients.  in total, 82 to 89% of the dose administered was assigned to unchanged rivaroxaban and its metabolites in the excreta of rats, dogs, and humans.  in 8 renal transplant patients, rivaroxaban levels showed a predictable pharmacokinetic trend, both at ctrough (30-61 μg/l) and at cpeak (143-449 μg/l), with limited variability in the 25th-75th percentile range.  a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (pbpk) model was developed to simulate rivaroxaban pharmacokinetics in young (20-45 years) or older (55-65 years) subjects with normal renal function, mild, moderate and severe renal impairment, with or without concomitant use of the combined p-gp and moderate cyp3a4 inhibitor, erythromycin. ||| ",Yes
Is PTEN involved in follicular thyroid carcinoma?,Yes,"The study has demonstrated that the under-expression of PTEN protein may play a role in the carcinogenesis and development of thyroid cancer. PTEN protein was found to be under-expressed more frequently in thyroid cancers (29%) than in benign thyroid tumors (4.2%). The reduction in PTEN expression in thyroid cancers was not significantly related with the recorded clinical factors such as size, age, lymph node metastasis and p53, except for Her-2 which was found to be significantly related. These results suggest that PTEN is involved in follicular thyroid carcinoma.","therefore, thyroid tumor cell lines show alteration of pten gene expression regulation.  papillary thyroid carcinoma (ptc) arises from the thyroid follicular epithelium and represents the most frequent thyroid malignancy.  several data indicate that silencing of pten gene expression may be relevant in follicular thyroid cell transformation.  this study has demonstrated that the under-expression of pten protein and the over-expression of her-2 protein may play a role in the carcinogenesis and development of thyroid cancer.  therefore, this study investigated the pten expression of thyroid cancer and the relationship between pten, clinical status and other biologic factors such as her-2/neu and p53.  most thyroid cancers are derived from the follicular cell.  pten protein was found to be under-expressed more frequently in thyroid cancers (29%) than in benign thyroid tumors (4.2%).  thus, in the present study regulation of pten gene expression in thyroid cells was investigated.  thyroid carcinomas derived from follicular cells comprise papillary thyroid carcinoma (ptc), follicular thyroid carcinoma, poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma (pdtc) and undifferentiated anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (atc).  these results demonstrate that the prevalence of the ptc gene in thyroid tumor is low and may not be essential for human thyroid tumorigenesis.  the reduction in pten expression in thyroid cancers was not significantly related with the recorded clinical factors such as size, age, lymph node metastasis and p53, except for her-2 which was found to be significantly related (p=0.001).  papillary thyroid carcinoma (ptc) cells express oncofetal fibronectin (onffn) mrna, which may be useful to detect circulating tumor cells.  follicular carcinoma (ftc) is considered more malignant than papillary thyroid carcinoma (ptc), and anaplastic thyroid cancer (atc) is one of the most lethal human cancers.  thyroid cancer is the most common malignancy of endocrine system, and papillary thyroid cancer (ptc) is the most common subtype.  follicular variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma (fvptc) is a common variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma (ptc), but the association between braf mutation and the clinicopathological and ultrasonographical characteristics of fvptc has not been well studied.  this gene has been thought to act as a tumorigenetic factor in thyroid carcinoma, although the action of ptc oncogene products is still unknown.  higher thyrotropin concentrations are predictive for a malignant nature of follicular neoplasm.  foxe1, a thyroid-specific transcription factor also known as ttf-2, was recently identified as a major genetic risk factor for papillary thyroid carcinoma (ptc).  papillary thyroid cancer (ptc) is the most common well-differentiated thyroid cancer.  the follicular variant (fv) of papillary thyroid carcinoma is characterized by a follicular growth pattern and cytologic features of papillary carcinoma. ||| ",Yes
Have Quantitative Trait Loci affecting splicing (splicing QTLs) been linked to disease?,Yes,"Justification: The context provided indicates that Quantitative Trait Loci affecting splicing, or splicing QTLs, have been linked to various diseases. Specifically, it is mentioned that these splicing QTLs have been implicated in both common and rare diseases, and that they may contribute to the etiology of complex diseases. The context also highlights a study that investigated splicing QTLs in 1,209 samples from 13 human brain regions, and found that many of the associated genes (40%) undergo alternative splicing. Furthermore, it is stated that DNA variants that affect alternative splicing have been shown to be risk alleles for some Mendelian diseases. In particular, the context describes a study that demonstrated that SNPs in a known COPD GWAS locus on chromosome 5q32 influence alternative splicing in the gene FBXO38. Overall, these findings suggest that splicing QTLs can provide novel insights into disease mechanisms and contribute to the genetic etiology of complex traits.","genetic variants regulating rna splicing and transcript usage have been implicated in both common and rare diseases.  some of these snps may contribute to disease by regulating gene splicing.  specifically, we hypothesize that single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) in splicing regulatory elements can be characterized in silico to identify variants affecting splicing, and that these variants may contribute to the etiology of complex diseases as well as the inter-individual variability in the ratios of alternative transcripts.  many sqtl-associated genes (40%) undergo alternative splicing.  dna variants that affect alternative splicing and the relative quantities of different gene transcripts have been shown to be risk alleles for some mendelian diseases.  here, we investigate whether snps that are associated with alternative splicing (splice qtl or sqtl) can identify novel functions for existing gwas variants or suggest new associated variants in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd).  we investigated splicing quantitative trait loci (sqtls) in 1,209 samples from 13 human brain regions, using rna sequencing (rna-seq) and genotype data from the genotype-tissue expression (gtex) project.  the overarching goal of this study is to discover and characterize the role that variants affecting alternative splicing may play in the genetic etiology of complex traits, which include a significant number of the common human diseases.  substantial progress has been made in the identification of sequence elements that control mrna splicing and the genetic variants in these elements that alter mrna splicing (referred to as splicing quantitative trait loci - sqtls).  an understanding of the genetic variation underlying transcript splicing is essential to dissect the molecular mechanisms of common disease.  integrating the binding motifs and expression patterns of rna binding proteins with exon splicing profiles, we uncovered likely causal variants underlying brain region-specific sqtls.  evidence linking causative snps to individual splicing differences between individuals is emerging and this may lead to a better understanding of susceptibilities related to rare drug-induced toxicities.  this report highlights a genomics platform developed to measure splicing changes that occur in response to drug exposures, and therefore is applicable for the study of drug-induced toxicity.  in particular, we demonstrated that snps in a known copd gwas locus on chromosome 5q32 influence alternative splicing in the gene fbxo38.  genome-wide rna splicing (with gene expression) can be used to discover variations that drive specific diseases and / or change the susceptibility in individuals to drug responses including tissue specific toxicities.  we carried out a transcriptome-wide analysis of the effects of a mutation in a ubiquitous splicing factor that causes retinitis pigmentosa (rp) on mrna splicing, using exon microarrays.  genetic variation of alternative splicing is a prevalent source of transcriptomic and proteomic diversity in human populations.  the available evidence from splicing quantitative trait locus (sqtl) studies has been limited to small samples.  we leverage high-throughput expression profiling to 1) experimentally validate our in silico predictions of skipped exons and 2) characterize the molecular role of intronic genetic variations in alternative splicing events in the context of complex human traits and diseases.  overall, these data indicate that analysis of alternative splicing can provide novel insights into disease mechanisms. ||| ",Yes
Is the Snord116 cluster associated with the Prader-Willi syndrome?,Yes,"The Snord116 cluster is indeed associated with Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS). PWS is a complex disorder that is often caused by the loss of paternal Snord116, a gene cluster that contains only non-coding RNAs. This cluster is located in the 15q11-13 region of paternally expressed genes, which is implicated in PWS. The loss of this gene cluster, along with the loss of Snord115, contributes to PWS, the most common syndromic form of obesity in humans. The lack of the paternal Snord116 gene cluster has been found to have a determinant role in the pathogenesis of PWS. Furthermore, non-protein coding small nucleolar RNAs, including those in the Snord116 cluster, are involved in the paternally deleted region of chromosome 15q11.2-q13, which is believed to cause the hyperphagic phenotype of PWS.","lack of expression for snord116 has been implicated in major phenotypes of prader-willi syndrome (pws).  the snord116 locus lies in the 15q11-13 region of paternally expressed genes implicated in prader-willi syndrome (pws), a complex disease accompanied by obesity and severe neurobehavioural disturbances.  the loss of two gene clusters encoding small nucleolar rnas, snord115 and snord116 contribute to prader-willi syndrome (pws), the most common syndromic form of obesity in humans.  prader-willi syndrome (pws), an imprinted neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by metabolic, sleep and neuropsychiatric features, is caused by the loss of paternal snord116, containing only non-coding rnas (ncrnas).  the imprinted small nucleolar rna (snorna) snord116 is implicated in the aetiology of prader-willi syndrome (pws), a disease associated with hyperphagia and obesity.  obsessive-compulsive disorder has been reported in association with prader-willi syndrome.  sleep-wake disturbances are often reported in prader-willi syndrome (pws), a rare neurodevelopmental syndrome that is associated with paternally-expressed genomic imprinting defects within the human chromosome region 15q11-13.  sleep apnoea and minor radiological evidence of narrowing of the upper airway are common in the prader-willi syndrome, although clinical otolaryngological examination is often unremarkable.  attempted complete ascertainment of people with prader-willi syndrome in eight english counties.  cases of pws patients with a deletion encompassing the snord116 gene cluster, but preserving the expression of flanking genes, have been described.  prader-willi syndrome is most often associated with interstitial deletion or uniparental disomy of chromosome 15q11-q13.  this finding in a human case strongly supports the current hypothesis that lack of the paternal snord116 gene cluster has a determinant role in the pathogenesis of pws.  individuals with prader-willi syndrome have speech and language impairments, suggesting possible involvement of the perisylvian region of the brain.  cooccurrence of prader-willi syndrome and psychosis has been reported in a few cases.  to investigate the role of anatomical factors in osa in the prader-willi syndrome, clinical and ent assessment, radiology of the upper airway and polysomnography including sleep oximetry were done in 14 subjects.  in prader-willi syndrome (pws), nonprotein coding small nucleolar (sno) rnas are involved in the paternally deleted region of chromosome 15q11.2-q13, which is believed to cause the hyperphagic phenotype of pws.  prader-willi syndrome (pws), a rare genetic disorder caused by the lack of expression of paternal genes from chromosome 15q11-13, has been investigated for autism spectrum disorder (asd) symptomatology in various studies.  prader willi syndrome (pws) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by a range of physical, psychological and physiological abnormalities.  recently, the snord116 gene has been associated with the development of pws, however, it's contribution to the behavioural aspects of the disease are unknown.  furthermore, an additional case with prader-willi syndrome and psychosis is briefly described. ||| ",Yes
Is indicated the use of antioxidant supplements in patients at risk for coronary artery disease?,Yes,"The use of antioxidant supplements in patients at risk for coronary artery disease is indicated, as they have been shown to play a role in atherosclerosis and have been associated with a reduced risk of myocardial infarction. Epidemiologic studies have found lower morbidity and mortality in persons who consume larger quantities of antioxidants in foods or supplements. Clinical trials have also indicated that supplementation with certain nutrients is beneficial in reducing the incidence of CHD events. However, it is important to note that recent clinical and experimental studies have suggested that antioxidant supplements might have harmful as well as beneficial effects in the setting of cardiovascular disease. Therefore, it is recommended to consult with a healthcare professional before starting any supplement regimen.","do antioxidant vitamins, in regular food or as food supplements, protect against myocardial infarction and stroke?  clinical use of antioxidant vitamin supplementation may help to prevent coronary heart disease (chd).  there is some evidence that antioxidant therapy may be beneficial for the prevention of coronary heart disease.  this review summarizes the scientific evidence for a possible role of antioxidants in the prevention of coronary heart disease (chd).  in observational studies (case-control or cohort design), people with high intake of antioxidant vitamins by regular diet or as food supplements generally have a lower risk of myocardial infarction and stroke than people who are low-consumers of antioxidant vitamins.  antioxidant vitamins are thought to play a role in atherosclerosis.  foods rich in antioxidants have been associated with a reduced risk of myocardial infarction.  epidemiologic studies find lower chd morbidity and mortality in persons who consume larger quantities of antioxidants in foods or supplements.  in this study, we investigated the relationship between coronary artery disease (cad) and serum antioxidative status by measuring the total antioxidant status (tas).  recent clinical and experimental studies have suggested that antioxidant supplements might actually have harmful as well as beneficial effects in the setting of cardiovascular disease.  dietary antioxidants and folic acid may play a role in the pathophysiology of coronary disease and stroke.  we review patient-oriented evidence on the effectiveness of supplementation with antioxidants and/or folic acid in the prevention of myocardial infarction and stroke.  clinical trials indicate that supplementation with certain nutrients is beneficial in reducing the incidence of chd events.  in this systematic literature review on the effects of antioxidant vitamins in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disorders, studies with ischaemic heart disease, stroke or combined cardiovascular events as end-points have been included.  these findings support the hypothesis that dietary antioxidants protect from myocardial infarction and that this effect might be exerted through interactions between antioxidants.  epidemiologic studies have shown a correlation between antioxidant intake and coronary artery disease (cad); however, the results of clinical trials have been inconsistent.  dietary supplements, such as those rich in antioxidants, have the potential to improve markers of cardiovascular health, but little is known about the total effect of these supplements.  recent studies suggest that the judicious development of antioxidant agents may provide an effective approach to quench oxidative stress in tissues and improve cardiovascular health.  to assess the evidence of the effectiveness of vitamin supplementation, specifically vitamins a, c, and e; beta-carotene; folic acid; antioxidant combinations; and multivitamin supplements, in preventing cardiovascular disease.  chronic inflammation and increased oxidative stress significantly contribute in developing coronary artery disease (cad). ||| ",No
Is sumoylation implicated in myogenesis?,Yes,"Justification: The context suggests that sumoylation plays a role in myogenesis, specifically in the regulation of myoblast proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. The sumoylation of histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) has been found to enhance the deacetylation of MyoD in undifferentiated myoblasts, while further sumoylation of HDAC1 contributes to switching its binding partners from MyoD to Rb to induce myocyte differentiation. The functional roles of the sumo modification during myogenesis have not been fully elucidated, but the evidence presented in the context indicates that sumoylation is implicated in the process.","sumoylation regulates multiple biological processes, including myoblast proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis.  in conclusion, sumoylation of human spermatozoa may be involved in the regulation of motility.  in vertebrates, developmental roles for sumoylation have been studied, but the function of sumoylation during mammalian oocyte growth and maturation is not known.  in conclusion, hdac1 sumoylation plays a dual role in myod signaling: enhancement of hdac1 deacetylation of myod in the basally sumoylated state of undifferentiated myoblasts and dissociation of hdac1 from myod during myogenesis.  two interesting questions about sumoylation have emerged: (1) how many sumo substrates exist in mammalian proteomes, such as human and mouse, (2) and what are their functions and how are they involved in a variety of biological processes?  as a versatile regulatory mechanism, sumoylation has been found to be essential for ordered diverse cellular processes.  however, the functional roles of the sumo modification during myogenesis have not been fully elucidated.  here, we report that basal sumoylation of histone deacetylase 1 (hdac1) enhances the deacetylation of myod in undifferentiated myoblasts, whereas further sumoylation of hdac1 contributes to switching its binding partners from myod to rb to induce myocyte differentiation.  sumoylation is a post-translational modification involved in the regulation of several cell functions.  sumoylation is a posttranslational modification that regulates a wide spectrum of cellular activities.  protein sumoylation is an important reversible post-translational modification of proteins in the nucleus, and it orchestrates a variety of the cellular processes.  sumoylation, the conjugation of a small ubiquitin-like modifier (sumo) protein to a target, has diverse cellular effects.  the sumo-binding motif exists in nearly all proteins known to be involved in sumo-dependent processes, suggesting its general role in sumoylation-dependent cellular functions.  as a prelude to conducting studies on the role of sumoylation during oocyte development, we analyzed the temporal and spatial pattern of expression of ube2i, a sumo-conjugating e2 enzyme.  we present evidence that in budding yeast sumoylation during mitosis may be controlled through the sumo deconjugating enzyme smt4/ulp2.  sumoylation is a posttranslational modification in which sumo (small ubiquitin-related modifier) proteins are covalently attached to their substrates.  sumo (small ubiquitin-like modifier) modification regulates many cellular processes, including transcription.  we report here that sumo-2/3 conjugation was elevated in the human failing hearts, and we investigated the impact of increased sumo-2 conjugation on heart function by using the gain-of-function approach in mice, in which cardiac specific expression of constitutively active sumo-2 was governed by alpha myosin heavy chain promoter (mhc-sumo-2 transgenic, sumo-2-tg).  recent studies suggest its involvement in spermatogenesis, but occurrence and function of sumo (small ubiquitin-like modifier) in mature spermatozoa remain unknown.  protein sumoylation is a posttranslational modification triggered by cellular stress. ||| ",Yes
Is protein Fbw7 a SCF type of E3 ubiquitin ligase?,Yes,"Fbw7, also known as Fbxw7, is a component of the SCF (Skp1-Cul1-F-box protein) type of E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. It serves as the substrate recognition component, conferring substrate specificity to the SCF complex. Fbw7 targets several oncoproteins for ubiquitination and subsequent degradation by the proteasome, playing crucial roles in cell growth, survival, and differentiation. The SCF(Fbw7) ubiquitin ligase complex is involved in the regulation of numerous cellular processes by targeting critical regulatory proteins for ubiquitination.","fbw7 (f-box and wd repeat domain-containing 7) is the substrate recognition component of an evolutionary conserved scf (complex of skp1, cul1 and f-box protein)-type ubiquitin ligase.  the f-box protein fbw7 (also known as fbxw7, hcdc4 and sel-10) functions as a substrate recognition component of a scf-type e3 ubiquitin ligase.  fbxw7 (f-box and wd repeat domain-containing 7) is the f-box protein component of a skp1-cul1-f-box protein-type (scf-type) ubiquitin ligase.  fbxw7 is a component of scf (complex of skp1, cul1 and f-box-protein)-type ubiquitin ligases that targets several oncoproteins for ubiquitination and degradation by the proteasome.  fbw7 is one of the most well characterized f-box proteins that serve as substrate recognition subunits of scf (skp1-cullin 1-f-box proteins) e3 ubiquitin ligase complexes.  f-box and wd repeat domain-containing 7 (fbxw7) is an e3-ubiquitin ligase, which serves as one of the components of the skp1, cul1, and f-box protein type ubiquitin ligase (scf) complex.  fbxo7 is the substrate-recognition component of the scffbxo7 (skp1-cul1-fbox protein) e3 ubiquitin ligase.  fbw7 is a member of f-box family proteins, which constitute one subunit of skp1, cul1, and f-box protein (scf) ubiquitin ligase complex.  f-box and wd repeat domain-containing 7 (fbw7), the substrate-binding subunit of e3 ubiquitin ligase scf(fbw7) (a complex of skp1, cullin-1 and fbw7), plays important roles in various physiological and pathological processes.  fbw7 (f-box and wd repeat domain-containing 7), also known as cdc4, ago and sel10, is the substrate recognition component of an evolutionary conserved scf (complex of skp1, cul1 and f-box protein)-type e3 ubiquitin ligase.  in scf ubiquitin ligases, a diverse array of f-box proteins confers substrate specificity.  the scf(fbw7) ubiquitin ligase complex plays important roles in cell growth, survival, and differentiation via the ubiquitin-proteasome-mediated regulation of protein stability.  f-box proteins determine the substrate specificities of scf ubiquitin ligases.  furthermore, using in vitro purified scf(fbw7) component proteins, we found that e1a directly bound to roc1/rbx1 and cul1 and that e1a inhibited the ubiquitin ligase activity of the roc1/rbx1-cul1 complex but not that of another ring-type ubiquitin ligase, mdm2.  f-box and wd-40 domain protein 7 (fbxw7) is a component of the skp1-cdc53/cullin-f-box-protein complex (scf/β-trcp), which is an e3 ubiquitin ligase that mediates protein degradation.  the f-box protein is the substrate recognition subunit of scf (skp1/cul1/f-box) e3 ubiquitin ligase complex, a multicomponent ring-type e3 ligase involved in the regulation of numerous cellular processes by targeting critical regulatory proteins for ubiquitination.  these observations demonstrated that e1a perturbs protein turnover regulated by scf(fbw7) through the inhibition of scf(fbw7) ubiquitin ligase.  the ubiquitin ligase complex scf(fbs1), which contributes to the ubiquitination of glycoproteins, is involved in the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation pathway.  f-box proteins are the substrate-recognition components of the skp1-cul1-f box protein (scf) e3 ubiquitin ligases.  taken together, these data reveal that scffbxo28 is the e3 ligase responsible for the self-ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of fbxo28, providing a new clue for the upstream signaling regulation for f-box proteins. ||| ",Yes
Are ultraconserved elements often transcribed?,Yes,"Ultraconserved elements, which are nucleotide or protein sequences with 100% identity across different species, have been found to be transcribed into a novel class of long noncoding RNAs known as transcribed ultraconserved regions (t-UCRs). These t-UCRs exhibit 100% DNA sequence conservation among humans, mice, and rats. They are derived from DNA sequences that are entirely conserved across species and serve as regulators of gene expression. While the role of t-UCRs in pain modulation is not well understood, they have been implicated in diverse biological processes. Therefore, it can be concluded that ultraconserved elements are often transcribed.","ultraconserved elements are nucleotide or protein sequences with 100% identity (no mismatches, insertions, or deletions) in the same organism or between two or more organisms.  ultraconserved elements (uces) are sequences that are identical between reference genomes of distantly related species.  we identified large numbers of ultraconserved elements across distant species.  ultraconserved elements are highly enriched with binding sites to developmental transcription factors regardless of how they cluster.  interestingly, we observed that ultraconserved elements clustered by sequence similarity.  our findings indicate that these ultraconserved elements are not the exclusive property of higher modern eukaryotes, but rather transmitted from their metazoan ancestors.  ultraconserved elements (uces) are stretches of hundreds of nucleotides with highly conserved cores flanked by variable regions.  ultraconserved elements (uces) are stretches of hundreds of nucleotides with highly conserved cores flanked by variable regions.  ultraconserved elements of dna have been identified in vertebrate and invertebrate genomes.  the ultraconserved elements (uces) are defined as stretches of at least 200 base pairs of human dna that match identically with corresponding regions in the mouse and rat genomes, albeit their real significance remains an intriguing issue.  ultraconservation has been variously defined to describe sequences that have remained identical or nearly so over long periods of evolution to a degree that is higher than expected for sequences under typical constraints associated with protein-coding sequences, splice sites, or transcription factor binding sites.  ultraconserved elements (uces) show the peculiar feature to retain extended perfect sequence identity among human, mouse, and rat genomes.  most intergenic ultraconserved elements (uce) appear to be tissue-specific enhancers, whereas another class of intragenic uces is involved in regulation of gene expression by means of alternative splicing.  transcribed ultraconserved regions (t-ucrs) are a novel class of long noncoding rnas transcribed from ucrs, which exhibit 100% dna sequence conservation among humans, mice, and rats.  ultraconserved regions (ucrs) are non-protein coding gene sequences that are strictly conserved across among different species.  transcribed ultraconserved regions (t-ucrs) are noncoding rnas derived from dna sequences that are entirely conserved across species.  transcribed ultraconserved regions (t-ucrs) are genomic regions conserved across large evolutionary distances, which encode for noncoding rnas that serve as regulators of gene expression.  transcribed ultraconserved regions are a novel class of long noncoding rnas and are completely conserved in humans, rats, and mice.  transcribed ultraconserved regions are a novel class of long noncoding rnas and are completely conserved in humans, rats, and mice.  transcribed ultraconserved regions have been implicated in diverse biological processes; however, very little is currently known about their role in pain modulation. ||| ",Yes
Can methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene mutations cause homocystinuria?,Yes,"Justification: Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene mutations can indeed cause homocystinuria. This is due to the fact that MTHFR is a key enzyme in the remethylation of homocysteine to methionine. A deficiency in MTHFR, which can be caused by gene mutations, can lead to hyperhomocysteinemia, a condition characterized by an abnormally high level of homocysteine in the blood. This, in turn, can result in homocystinuria, a disorder of the metabolism of the amino acid methionine. Different MTHFR mutations can lead to either severe homocystinuria or moderate hyperhomocysteinemia, both of which are associated with a wide spectrum of disorders.","inherited methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (mthfr) deficiency is associated with a wide spectrum of disorders including homocystinuria.  some methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (mthfr) gene mutations cause hyperhomocysteinemia and homocystinuria.  a severe deficiency of mthfr results in hyperhomocysteinaemia and homocystinuria.  deficiency in methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (mthfr), the enzyme involved in the remethylation of homocysteine to methionine using methyltetrahydrofolate as cofactor, induces hyperhomocysteinaemia, homocysteinuria, hypomethioninaemia and low methylfolate levels.  severe mthfr deficiency results in marked hyperhomocysteinemia and homocystinuria.  methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (mthfr) deficiency is an autosomal recessive disorder resulting in elevated homocysteine levels in plasma and urine.  severe mthfr deficiency results in homocystinuria and neurologic impairment.  different mthfr mutations lead either to severe homocystinuria as a multisystem disorder or to moderate hyperhomocysteinaemia, which is a common risk factor for disorders ranging from cardiovasculopathy to spina bifida.  the c677t variant of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (mthfr), a key enzyme in the remethylation of homocysteine to methionine, is a frequent genetic cause of mild hyperhomocysteinemia among individuals with low folate status.  methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (mthfr) has a key role in converting homocysteine to methionine so its deficiency might cause homocysteine accumulation and arterial destruction.  the results of our study render the full-length characterisation of affected alleles in severe homocystinuria and moderate hyperhomocysteinaemia due to mthfr deficiency and provide a basis for investigating the regulation of the human mthfr gene.  a polymorphism in methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (mthfr) is the most common genetic cause of mild hyperhomocysteinemia.  methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (mthfr) is a key enzyme in the regulation of plasma homocysteine levels.  mthfr deficiency, an autosomal recessive disorder, results in homocysteinemia.  the mthfr gene encodes the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase known to be involved in the homocysteine-methionine pathway.  methyltetrahydrofolate reductase (mthfr) is a main regulatory enzyme in homocysteine (hcy) metabolism.  mthfr deficiency, an autosomal recessive disorder, results in homocystinuria and hypomethioninaemia and presents with highly variable symptoms affecting many organs but predominantly the central nervous system.  the human 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (mthfr) represents a major enzyme in the folate-dependent regulation of methionine and homocysteine concentrations.  methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (mthfr) is important for folate and homocysteine (hcy) metabolism.  polymorphisms of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (mthfr) have been well documented to cause hyperhomocysteinemia, and recent studies suggest an association of c677t mutation of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase with low bone mineral density (bmd). ||| ",Yes
Is CREB a key memory protein?,Yes,"The cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element binding protein (CREB) is a critical component in memory formation. CREB is a phosphorylation-dependent transcription factor that plays a pivotal role in memory consolidation and various neuropsychological disorders. The phosphorylation of CREB is essential for long-term memory processes. CREB is a crucial mediator of activity-regulated gene transcription underlying memory formation and allocation. It is critically involved in several important brain functions, including the formation of long-term memory. CREB is an evolutionarily conserved transcription regulator essential for long-term memory formation. The CREB-CRE transcriptional pathway is pivotal in the formation of some types of long-term memory. The CREB-binding protein (CBP) is an essential component of long-term memory formation through its histone acetyltransferase function. CREB-dependent transcription necessary for long-term memory is driven by interactions with CBP, affecting the expression of thousands of genes. CREB is also responsible for the short-term memory response in C. elegans against bacterial pathogens. CREB phosphorylation and signaling play an important role in long-term memory formation. However, other posttranslational modifications of CREB are less known.

Can canagliflozin cause euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis?,Yes,"Canagliflozin, a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor, has been reported to cause euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The mechanism of canagliflozin-associated DKA is thought to be related to the drug's inhibition of glucose reabsorption in the kidney, leading to increased glucose excretion in the urine and decreased insulin secretion from the pancreas. This can result in a state of relative insulin deficiency, which can trigger the development of DKA even in the absence of overt hyperglycemia. The risk of canagliflozin-associated DKA may be increased in patients with renal impairment, as systemic exposure to the drug is increased in these individuals. Discontinuation of canagliflozin has been shown to resolve euglycemic DKA in some patients.","treatment with canagliflozin was associated with development of euglycemic ketoacidosis.  we report the presentation and management of two cases of canagliflozin associated diabetic ketoacidosis (dka) and discuss the mechanism of canagliflozin associated dka.  a 52-year-old man with type 2 diabetes mellitus developed profound ketoacidosis without overt hyperglycemia while taking canagliflozin.  we describe a case in which a patient experienced difficult-to-treat metabolic ketoacidosis in the setting of canagliflozin use.  we are reporting a timely case of atypical euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis in a type 1 diabetic patient treated with sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (sglt-2) inhibitor canagliflozin.  the potential for canagliflozin to cause clinical drug-drug interactions (ddis) was assessed.  however, drug interactions with canagliflozin can affect its glucoselowering therapeutic effects or exacerbate its adverse effects.  euglycemic ketoacidosis did not recur in our patient after discontinuing canagliflozin.  this study evaluated renal and non-renal effects of canagliflozin on postprandial plasma glucose (pg) excursion in patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with metformin.  these findings indicate that canagliflozin appears to impede ischemic peripheral tissue recovery and warrant further clinical investigation in individuals with diabetes and a history of peripheral artery disease.  canagliflozin is a recently approved drug for use in the treatment of type 2 diabetes.  ketoacidosis resolved after increasing dextrose and insulin doses supporting the hypothesis that sglt-2 inhibitors may lead to hypoinsulinemia.  canagliflozin is a novel drug for diabetes mellitus with the mechanisms of inducing glucosuria through inhibition of the sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 in the kidney independent of insulin activity.  canagliflozin lowers blood glucose levels independently of insulin, with the inhibition of sglt2 reducing renal reabsorption of glucose and increasing excretion of glucose in the urine.  systemic exposure to canagliflozin increased in the renal impairment groups relative to participants with normal renal function.  to the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of canagliflozin-associated acute pancreatitis in clinical literature.  canagliflozin improves glycemic control in an insulin-independent fashion through inhibition of glucose reuptake in the kidney.  canagliflozin, a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor indicated for lowering glucose, has been increasingly used in diabetes patients because of its beneficial effects on cardiovascular and renal outcomes.  canagliflozin was generally well tolerated, had a low risk of hypoglycaemia and was most commonly associated with adverse events such as genital and urinary tract infections and increased urination, consistent with its mechanism of action.  there is a reported increased incidence of lower extremity amputations in individuals with diabetes who are treated with canagliflozin (an sglt2 receptor inhibitor). ||| ",Yes

Is Tuberous Sclerosis a genetic disease?,Yes,"Justification: Tuberous Sclerosis is indeed a genetic disorder. It is an autosomal dominant disorder, which means that a mutation in one copy of the gene is sufficient to cause the disorder. The mutation can occur in either the TSC1 or TSC2 gene. These genes are responsible for producing proteins that regulate cell growth and division, and mutations in these genes can lead to the development of benign tumors in various organs, including the skin, brain, kidneys, and lungs. The disorder is characterized by high genetic penetrance, meaning that most individuals who inherit the mutated gene will develop the disorder.","tuberous sclerosis (ts) is a rare genetic disorder of autosomal-dominant inheritance.  tuberous sclerosis (ts) is a relatively rare, autosomal dominant syndrome that displays high genetic penetrance in affected families.  tuberous sclerosis is a single-gene disorder caused by heterozygous mutations in the tsc1 (9q34) or tsc2 (16p13.3) gene and is frequently associated with mental retardation, autism and epilepsy.  tuberous sclerosis is a developmental genetic disorder caused by mutations in tsc1, which results in epilepsy, autism, and intellectual disability.  tuberous sclerosis is a relatively common inherited disease that causes multiple benign tumours in different organs, frequently leading to skin rashes, seizures and mental handicap.  here we review the current state of knowledge of the molecular genetics of tuberous sclerosis and the spectrum of mutations seen in and the implications of recent findings for patients.  tuberous sclerosis is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder that is characterized by the early development of hamartomas, malformations, and congenital tumors of the nervous system, skin, kidneys, lungs, and heart.  tuberous sclerosis complex is a rare autosomal dominant disorder caused by mutations in either of tsc1 and tsc2 genes.  tuberous sclerosis (tsc) is an autosomal dominant disorder, caused by mutations of either the tsc1 or tsc2 gene.  tuberous sclerosis (tsc) is caused by a mutation in either the tsc1 or tsc2 gene.  tuberous sclerosis (tsc) is a single-gene disorder caused by heterozygous mutations in the tsc1 or tsc2 gene.  tuberous sclerosis is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by involvement of skin, nervous system, kidneys, and lungs.  tuberous sclerosis complex is an autosomal dominant multi-system disorder with an incidence of about 1 in 6000 live births.  tuberous sclerosis (tsc) is an autosomal dominant disorder with both neurological and cutaneous manifestations often resulting in significant disability.  tuberous sclerosis complex (tsc), a heritable neurodevelopmental disorder, is caused by mutations in the tsc1 or tsc2 genes.  tuberous sclerosis complex (tsc) is a rare autosomal-dominant disorder caused by mutations in the tsc1 or tsc2 genes.  tuberous sclerosis complex is an autosomal dominant disease of benign tumors occurring in multiple organ systems of the body.  tuberous sclerosis (tsc) is a human genetic syndrome characterized by the development of benign tumors in a variety of tissues, as well as rare malignancies.  tuberous sclerosis complex presents diverse clinical characteristics, and either of tsc1 and tsc2 genes shows a wide range of mutations in their coding regions.  we describe the clinical characteristics of a chinese family with tsc1 gene mutation and present a literature review of chinese patients with tuberous sclerosis complex gene mutation reported since 2004. ||| ",Yes
Is a CpG island methylator phenotype involved in ependymomas?,Yes,"Hypermethylation of promoter CpG islands is a common epigenetic event in various human cancers, including ependymomas. The study examines the frequency of aberrant CpG island methylation in several tumor-associated genes in a group of 27 ependymomas. The findings suggest that methylation commonly contributes to the inactivation of cancer-related genes in ependymomas. The study also concludes that there is a general deregulation of CpG island methylation in ependymomas, and that hypermethylation is not limited to single genes, but a number of genes are methylated concurrently. This is similar to the CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) identified in glioma and colon carcinoma. Therefore, it can be concluded that a CpG island methylator phenotype is involved in ependymomas.","we determined the frequency of aberrant cpg island methylation of several tumor-associated genes: p16(ink4a), rb1, mgmt, dapk, timp3, thbs1, tp73, nf2 and caspase 8 in a group of 27 ependymomas, consisting of 22 who grade ii samples and five anaplastic who grade iii tumors.  dna methylation changes are likely to have biological importance in ependymomas.  our findings suggest that methylation commonly contributes to the inactivation of cancer-related genes in ependymomas.  hypermethylation of promoter cpg islands is a common epigenetic event in a variety of human cancers.  taken together, we conclude that hypermethylation of cpg islands is a common epigenetic event that is associated with the development of oligodendroglial tumors.  the aim of the present study is to investigate the relationship between the methylation status and clinicopathological parameters in ependymomas.  aberrant methylation of promoter cpg islands in human genes is an alternative genetic inactivation mechanism that contributes to the development of human tumors.  we conclude that there is a general deregulation of cpg island methylation in leukemia and that hypermethylation is not limited to single genes, but a number of genes are methylated concurrently.  supratentorial and spinal tumors displayed significantly more hypermethylated genes than posterior fossa tumors, similar to the 'cpg island methylator phenotype' (cimp) identified in glioma and colon carcinoma.  aberrant methylation of promoter cpg islands in human genes represents an alternative mechanism for genetic inactivation, and contributes to the development of human tumors.  tumors with a cpg island methylator phenotype (cimp), a distinct subgroup with extensive dna methylation, show characteristic features in the case of colorectal cancer.  the mechanisms underlying ectopic methylation of cpg islands in neoplastic cells are poorly understood.  hypermethylation in cancer often occurs in cpg islands that span the promoter regions of tumor suppressor genes.  the nonrandom pattern of increased cpg island methylation in the hybrid cell lines suggests that locus-specific features and/or clonal selection, and not just dna mtase expression, affect the evolution of ectopic methylation in neoplastic cells.  methylation status of core regions in promoter cpg islands was examined for 20 (candidate) tumor-suppressor genes, 4 genes that are not considered as tumor-suppressors, but are frequently silenced in human cancers, and 6 normally methylated melanoma antigen genes (mages).  the cpg island methylator phenotype (cimp or cimp-high) with widespread promoter methylation is a distinct epigenetic phenotype in colorectal cancer.  aberrant de novo methylation of cpg island dna sequences has been observed in cultured cell lines or upon malignant transformation, but the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are poorly understood.  our results showed that hypermethylation of cpg islands was detectable in 8 of 11 genes studied and 74% of tumors were hypermethylated in at least 1 gene.  the cpg island methylator phenotype (cimp or cimp-high) with widespread promoter methylation is a distinct phenotype in colorectal cancer.  concurrent dna methylation of multiple genes occurs in endometrial cancer and is referred to as the cpg island methylator phenotype (cimp). ||| ",Yes
Is depression associated with poor prognosis of brain tumor patients?,Yes,"The context suggests that depression is associated with worse survival outcomes in patients with brain tumors, specifically malignant astrocytoma and glioma. This association is independent of factors such as degree of disability, tumor grade, and subsequent treatment modalities. The presence of preoperative depressive symptoms has been linked to poor outcomes in patients with astrocytoma. Furthermore, depression has been found to negatively impact the quality of life of cancer patients. Although the underlying mechanisms of this association are not fully understood, it is clear that depression is a common complication of brain tumors and is associated with poor prognosis.","depression as a common complication of brain tumors.  it remains unclear if clinical depression affects survival after surgical management of malignant brain astrocytoma.  in our experience, patients who are actively depressed at the time of surgery were associated with decreased survival after surgical management of malignant astrocytoma, independent of degree of disability, tumor grade, or subsequent treatment modalities.  depression was associated with significantly worsened survival regardless of time of diagnosis, especially among patients with high-grade glioma.  depression in cancer patients is prevalent and negatively impacts their quality of life.  depression appears to be associated with worse survival from cancer, but underlying mechanisms for this association are unknown.  preoperative depressive symptoms are associated with poor outcomes in patients with an astrocytoma.  depression and neurocognitive function, particularly executive functioning (ef), have been associated with overall survival (os) in patients with glioblastoma (gbm).  in the present study, we explored the degree to which tumor genotype may be associated with depression in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (nsclc).  depression can have debilitating effects on patients with a chronic morbid disease, in particular, cancer.  although depression appears to be associated with worse survival from cancer, the underlying mechanisms of this association are unknown.  depression is associated with worse survival in metastatic nsclc, and this relationship may be at least partially explained by tumor egfr genotype.  the aim of this meta-analysis was to study the effect of depression on glioma patients' survival.  depression is a common symptom among gastric cancer (gc) patients and serves as a potential indication of poor prognosis and advanced cancer clinical stage.  using re model, the various measures for survival outcomes displayed worsened outcomes for both high and low-grade glioma patients with depression compared to those without depression.  the findings indicated that depression could influence the association between cognitive functioning and qol in breast cancer patients.  at present, it is not clear whether mood disorders (md) and poor health related quality of life (hrqol) in the glioma population correlate with features of the tumor, or rather with secondary symptoms associated with treatment.  we investigated this possible relationship in a cohort of patients with metastatic nsclc, in which we had previously demonstrated an association between depression and worse survival.  is there a possible common pathogenesis for depression and glioma?  cytokines are associated with depressive symptoms in the general population and are important mediators of tumor growth and progression.the aims of this study were to: (1) characterize depressive symptoms, other treatment-related symptoms and biological mediators; and (2) determine whether preoperative depressive symptoms were associated with the selected biological mediators. ||| ",Yes
Is the protein product of the cylindromatosis gene (CYLD) a deubiquitinating enzyme?,Yes,"The protein product of the cylindromatosis gene (CYLD) is indeed a deubiquitinating enzyme. This has been demonstrated through various studies, including those involving Drosophila and mammalian counterparts. CYLD is known to regulate various cellular processes such as cell proliferation, cell survival, and inflammatory responses, primarily by inhibiting NF-kappab signaling. The deubiquitinating activity of CYLD is crucial for its function as a tumor suppressor, and loss of this activity is correlated with tumorigenesis. Furthermore, CYLD has been shown to remove Lys-63-linked ubiquitin chains from I kappa B kinase signaling components, thereby inhibiting NF-kappab pathway activation.","cylindromatosis (cyld) is a deubiquitinating enzyme that is altered in patients with familial cylindromatosis, a condition characterized by numerous benign adnexal tumors.  here, we examined the potential role of the deubiquitinating enzyme cyld (cylindromatosis), mutation of which has been reported to cause familial cylindromatosis.  cyld is a deubiquitylase with tumor suppressor functions, first identified in patients with familial cylindromatosis.  the cylindromatosis gene (cyld) encodes a deubiquitinase that was initially             identified as a tumor suppressor and has recently been investigated in connection             with a variety of normal physiological processes.  the tumor-suppressor cylindromatosis (cyld) is a deubiquitinating enzyme and key regulator of cell proliferation and inflammation.  loss of the deubiquitinating activity of cyld correlates with tumorigenesis.  cyld has deubiquitinating enzyme activity and inhibits the activation of transcription factor nf-kappab.  loss of the deubiquitinating activity of cyld is correlated with tumorigenesis.  we demonstrate that the protein product of drosophila cyld (cyld), like its mammalian counterpart, is a deubiquitylating enzyme.  cyld, a tumor suppressor gene, has deubiquitinating enzyme activity and inhibits the activation of transcription factor nf-kappab.  the cyld gene product is a deubiquitinating enzyme that was shown to regulate cell proliferation, cell survival and inflammatory responses, mainly through inhibiting nf-kappab signalling.  cyld is a deubiquitination enzyme that regulates different cellular processes, such as cell proliferation and cell survival.  as a deubiquitination enzyme, cyld regulates the proliferation, development and activation of lymphoid cells.  recent studies suggest that transfected cyld has deubiquitinating enzyme activity and inhibits the activation of transcription factor nf-kappab.  it encodes a deubiquitylating enzyme (cyld) that is a negative regulator of the nf-kappab and jnk signaling pathways, in vitro.  the cyld gene encodes a deubiquitinating enzyme that removes lys-63-linked ubiquitin chains from i kappa b kinase signaling components and thereby inhibits nf-kappab pathway activation.  the cylindromatosis tumor suppressor gene (cyld) encodes an enzyme (cyld) with deubiquitinating activity that has been implicated in the regulation of thymocyte selection in an nf-κb-essential-modulator (nemo)-dependent manner.  here we show that cyld is a deubiquitinating enzyme that negatively regulates activation of the transcription factor nf-kappab by specific tumour-necrosis factor receptors (tnfrs).  the cyld lysine 63 deubiquitinase gene (cyld) encodes tumor suppressor protein that is mutated in familial cylindromatosus, and variants have been associated with crohn disease (cd).  familial cylindromatosis is caused by mutations in a gene encoding the cyld protein of previously unknown function. ||| ",Yes
Can FOXOs modulate longevity?,Yes,"The Forkhead Box O (FOXO) transcription factors have been identified as key regulators of longevity across various species. In particular, FOXO3 has been consistently associated with human longevity, as evidenced by numerous studies. The longevity-associated alleles of FOXO3 have been linked to significantly longer lifespan in individuals affected by cardiometabolic disorders. FOXO transcription factors are involved in the regulation of longevity through insulin and insulin-like growth factor signaling. Furthermore, the diversity of upstream regulation and downstream effects of FOXOs suggests that they function as homeostasis regulators, maintaining tissue homeostasis over time and coordinating responses to environmental changes, such as growth factor deprivation, metabolic stress, and oxidative stress.","this article describes briefly the existing knowledge that is related to the role of foxo factors in human longevity.  our study provides novel insights into the basis for the long-established role of foxo3 as a longevity gene.  the forkhead box o (foxo) transcription factors are famous for their role in longevity: both caenorhabditis elegans and drosophila melanogaster can extend their median and maximum lifespan in a foxo-dependent manner, and certain single nucleotide polymorphisms in human foxo genes are associated with reaching an age above 100 years.  foxo3 is a prominent longevity gene.  we highlight some of the key findings that are associated with foxo3 protein, its gene and homologs in relation to lifespan in different species, and the insights these findings might provide about the molecular, cellular, and physiological processes that modulate aging and longevity in humans.  understanding the regulatory inputs on foxo may reveal how changes in these regulatory signaling pathways affect disease and lifespan.  here, we discuss possible connections between foxo and the dna damage response in the context of the broader role of connecting lifespan and disease.  several human studies provide evidence for an association between aging, longevity and variation in foxo3.  for instance, foxo (forkhead box o) genes determine human longevity.  we suggest that the foxo3 longevity genotype increases lifespan only in at-risk individuals by protection against cardiometabolic stress.  in model organisms, foxo activity also affects stem cell maintenance and lifespan as well as age-related diseases, such as cancer and diabetes.  the foxo family of transcription factors is central to the regulation of organismal longevity and cellular survival.  foxo transcription factors (foxos) are central regulators of lifespan across species, yet they also have cell-specific functions, including adult stem cell homeostasis and immune function.  follow-up until dec 31, 2019 found that in cmd-affected individuals, longevity-associated alleles of foxo3 were associated with significantly longer lifespan: haplotype hazard ratio 0.81 (95% ci 0.72-0.91; diabetes 0.77, hypertension 0.82, chd 0.83).  foxo3 is one of the most prominent genes demonstrating a consistently reproducible genetic association with human longevity.  previous studies note specific foxo3 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) associated with human longevity.  foxo transcription factors are involved in the regulation of longevity phenomenon via insulin and insulin-like growth factor signaling.  reduced telomere attrition may be a key mechanism for the longevity-promoting effect of the foxo3 genotype studied.  foxo3 is generally recognized as a ""master"" gene in aging since its association with longevity has been replicated in multiple organisms and human populations.  the diversity of this upstream regulation and the downstream effects of foxos suggest that they function as homeostasis regulators to maintain tissue homeostasis over time and coordinate a response to environmental changes, including growth factor deprivation, metabolic stress (starvation) and oxidative stress. ||| ",Yes
Are there methods for generating highly multiplexed ChIP-seq libraries?,Yes,"The context describes a novel method for generating high-throughput sequencing libraries from scarce amounts of ChIP DNA, termed as nano-ChIP-seq protocol. This method combines a high-sensitivity small-scale ChIP assay and a tailored procedure for library preparation. Additionally, the context mentions a new method for ChIP-seq sample preparation, called lobchip, where library reactions are performed on cross-linked ChIP fragments captured on beads. These methods suggest the existence of techniques for generating highly multiplexed ChIP-seq libraries.","here, we describe a novel method to analyze such data that intelligently uses the joint information from multiple related chip-seq libraries.  although there are a number of methods available for single chip-seq data analysis (e.g.  however, frequently multiple chip-seq libraries derived from differing cell lines or tissue types from the same individual may be available.  the widespread application of chip-seq led to a growing need for consistent analysis of multiple epigenetics profiles, for instance, in human studies where multiple replicates are a common element of design.  while numerous algorithms have recently been proposed for analysing the large chip-seq datasets, their relative merits and potential limitations remain unclear in practical applications.  here we describe a nano-chip-seq protocol that combines a high-sensitivity small-scale chip assay and a tailored procedure for generating high-throughput sequencing libraries from scarce amounts of chip dna.  here, we describe how to perform chip-seq starting with whole tissues or cell lines, and ending with millions of short sequencing tags that can be aligned to the reference genome of the species under investigation.  we describe a new method for chip-seq sample preparation, termed lobchip, where the library reactions are performed on cross-linked chip fragments captured on beads.  we also outline additional procedures to recover chip-chip libraries for chip-seq and discuss contemporary issues in data analysis.  chip-seq is the method of choice for genome-wide studies of protein-dna interactions.  current chip-seq studies are interested in comparing multiple epigenetic profiles across several cell types and tissues simultaneously for studying constitutive and differential regulation.  chip-seq is the primary technique used to investigate genome-wide protein-dna interactions.  chip-seq is a powerful technology to measure the protein binding or histone modification strength in the whole genome scale.  chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by massively parallel, high throughput sequencing (chip-seq) is the method of choice for genome-wide identification of dna segments bound by specific transcription factors or in chromatin with particular histone modifications.  chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with massively parallel sequencing (chip-seq) is increasingly being applied to study transcriptional regulation on a genome-wide scale.  although a variety of methods exist for analysis of the established alternative chip microarray (chip-chip), few approaches have been described for processing chip-seq data.  we leveraged these findings to produce a set of ctcf chip-seq datasets in rare, primary hematopoietic progenitor cells.  however, conventional chip protocols necessitate the use of large numbers of cells, and library preparation steps associated with current high-throughput sequencing platforms require substantial amounts of dna; both of these factors preclude the application of chip-seq technology to many biologically important but rare cell types.  chip-seq is becoming the main approach to the genome-wide study of protein-dna interactions and histone modifications.  these approaches were integrated in a general-purpose framework, named ccat (control-based chip-seq analysis tool), for the significance analysis of chip-seq. ||| ",Yes
Does Enzastaurin improve survival of glioblastoma patients?,No,"The study investigates the use of Enzastaurin in combination with radiation therapy for the treatment of newly diagnosed glioblastoma patients without mgmt promoter hypermethylation. The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the progression-free survival rate at 6 months (PFS-6) in these patients. Enzastaurin is a protein kinase C inhibitor with anti-tumor activity and has shown promising results in preclinical studies and phase I and II trials in various advanced cancers. However, the study does not provide conclusive evidence on the improvement of overall survival in glioblastoma patients with the use of Enzastaurin. Further studies are needed to determine the long-term effects of Enzastaurin on the survival of glioblastoma patients.","enzastaurin has anti-glioma activity in patients with recurrent high-grade glioma, but does not appear to have enough single-agent activity to be useful as monotherapy.  enzastaurin, a potent inhibitor of protein kinase c-beta, inhibits angiogenesis and has direct cytotoxic activity against glioma cells in preclinical studies.  enzastaurin is emerging as a promising new antitumor treatment.  this study was designed to determine if maintenance enzastaurin improved the outcome of whole brain radiotherapy (wbrt) in lung cancer (lc) patients with brain metastases (bms).  this study's primary objective was evaluation of the progression-free survival rate at 6 months (pfs-6) in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma without o(6)-methylguanine-dna-methyltransferase (mgmt) promoter hypermethylation postsurgically treated with enzastaurin before and concomitantly with radiation therapy, followed by enzastaurin maintenance therapy.  enzastaurin is a protein kinase c inhibitor with anti-tumor activity.  several preliminary studies showed promising results in patients with various advanced cancers and suggested that enzastaurin can be safely used long term in combination with traditional chemotherapies.  enzastaurin - a novel oral antitumor agent that selectively inhibits protein kinase cbeta activity - has demonstrated promise in phase i and ii trials in various advanced cancers, and is being investigated in multiple hematologic malignancies and solid tumors.  enzastaurin (ly317615.hcl) is an oral selective pkc-beta inhibitor with antiproliferative efficacy in various tumor models.  patients were treated with enzastaurin prior to, concomitantly with, and after standard partial brain radiotherapy.  enzastaurin was evaluated alone and in combination with the egfr inhibitor gefitinib, on growth and signalling protein expression in human cancer cells sensitive and resistant to anti-egfr drugs, both in vitro and in nude mice.  remarkably, these results were confirmed in vivo, where enzastaurin showed antitumour activity and cooperativity with gefitinib in mice grafted with geo and geo-gr tumours, incrementing their median survival and inhibiting the aforesaid protein expression and secretion in tumour specimens.  enzastaurin (ly317615) was initially developed as an antiangiogenic cancer therapy.  in conclusion, enzastaurin by interfering with signalling proteins implicated in egfr drug resistance markedly cooperates with gefitinib in sensitive and gefitinib-resistant tumours, thus overcoming and reverting such resistance and providing a rational basis for its development in patients resistant to anti-egfr drugs.  here we report on a multicenter, open-label, uncontrolled phase ii study of patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma without mgmt promoter hypermethylation treated with enzastaurin and radiation therapy within 4 study periods.  this review addresses the mechanism of action, development, preclinical studies, and clinical study results with enzastaurin.  we investigated the antitumour effect and ability to overcome the resistance to anti-egfr drugs of enzastaurin, an inhibitor of vegfr-dependent pkcbeta signalling.  we demonstrated the marked inhibitory activity of enzastaurin against geo colon and pc3 prostate cancer cells and their gefitinib-resistant counterparts geo-gr and pc3-gr, accompanied by inhibition of pakt and its effector pp70s6k, pgsk3beta and vegf expression and secretion.  enzastaurin alone presented not active in renal cell carcinoma cell lines.  glioblastoma treatment as now constituted offers increased survival measured in months over untreated patients. ||| ",No
Does prudent diet reduce cardiovascular risk?,Yes,"The evidence suggests that adherence to a prudent diet is associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Epidemiological findings indicate that higher adherence to a healthy diet may lower CVD risk, and consumption of healthy dietary patterns has been linked to reduced risk of CVD and metabolic syndrome. A heart-healthy diet has been shown to lower an individual's risk for CVD, and healthy lifestyle choices, including eating a prudent diet, can substantially reduce coronary heart disease (CHD) risk by improving lipids, blood pressure, and other risk factors. A successful dietary strategy should reduce CHD endpoints, improve correctable risk factors for CHD, and provide for an overall healthful lifestyle. Persons following current dietary guidelines have a lower risk of mortality from CHD. The evidence regarding the impact of diet on intermediate risk factors, such as blood pressure and cholesterol levels, and the impact on cardiovascular endpoints is discussed. Compared with participants whose diet quality remained relatively stable, those with the greatest improvement in diet quality scores had a 7% to 8% lower CVD risk in the subsequent 4-year period. Adherence to several diet quality scores, including the alternative healthy eating index, alternative Mediterranean diet score, and dietary approach to stop hypertension, has been associated with lower risk of CVD.","prudent dietary patterns are associated with reduced risk of arterial cardiovascular diseases (cvd).  this paper describes the importance of diet in cardiovascular disease prevention.  epidemiological findings indicate that higher adherence to a healthy diet may lower cardiovascular disease (cvd) risk.  consumption of healthy dietary patterns has been associated with reduced risk of cardiovascular disease and metabolic syndrome.  consuming a heart-healthy diet lowers the individual's risk for cardiovascular disease.  healthy lifestyle choices such as eating a prudent diet, exercising regularly, managing weight, and not smoking may substantially reduce coronary heart disease (chd) risk by improving lipids, blood pressure, and other risk factors.  a successful dietary strategy should reduce coronary heart disease (chd) endpoints, improve correctable risk factors for chd, and provide for an overall healthful lifestyle.  persons following current dietary guidelines have a lower risk of mortality from coronary heart disease.  we conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: what are the effects of dietary advice in generally healthy adults without existing cvd or increased cvd risk factors to improve cardiovascular outcomes (mortality, cardiovascular events, and cardiovascular risk factors)?  we conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: what are the effects of dietary advice in generally healthy adults without existing cvd or increased cvd risk factors to improve cardiovascular outcomes (mortality, cardiovascular events, and cardiovascular risk factors)?  individual change in dietary behaviour has the potential to decrease the burden of chronic disease, particularly cardiovascular disease (cvd).  individual change in dietary behaviour has the potential to decrease the burden of chronic disease, particularly cardiovascular disease (cvd).  the evidence regarding the impact of diet on intermediate risk factors (such as blood pressure and cholesterol levels) and the impact on cardiovascular endpoints are discussed.  evidence that lowering blood cholesterol levels reduces risk of coronary heart disease has prompted widespread recommendations that hyperlipidemic individuals undergo dietary therapy.  compared with participants whose diet quality remained relatively stable in each 4-year period, those with the greatest improvement in diet quality scores had a 7% to 8% lower cvd risk in the subsequent 4-year period (pooled hazard ratio, 0.92  for the alternative healthy eating index; 0.93  for the alternative mediterranean diet score; and 0.93  for the dietary approach to stop hypertension; all p for trend <0.05).  modifiable risk factors, such as diet, are becomingly increasingly important in the management of cardiovascular disease, one of the greatest major causes of death and disease burden.  our findings suggest that a heart healthy dietary pattern is associated with moderately reduced risk of mi, but not related to risk of vte.  adherence to a healthy diet was examined in relation to cvd, coronary heart disease (chd), and stroke incidence (cox regression), and risk markers (linear regression) with adjustment for relevant confounders.  adherence to several diet quality scores, including the alternative healthy eating index, alternative mediterranean diet score, and dietary approach to stop hypertension, has been associated with lower risk of cardiovascular disease (cvd), but little is known about how changes in these scores over time influence subsequent cvd risk.  we analyzed the association between 4-year changes in the 3 diet quality scores (alternative healthy eating index, alternative mediterranean diet score, and dietary approach to stop hypertension) and subsequent cardiovascular disease (cvd) risk among 29 343 men in the health professionals follow-up study and 51 195 women in the nurses' health study (1986-2010). ||| ",Yes
Are epigenetic modifications implicated in cardiovascular development and disease?,Yes,"Epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation and histone modifications, have been reported to play a significant role in cardiovascular development and disease. These modifications are key regulators of gene transcription and are often associated with maladaptive processes underlying cardiovascular disease. DNA methylation, in particular, has been identified as a key epigenetic mechanism contributing to the developmental origins of adult cardiovascular disease. Epigenetic aberrations caused by environmental factors and lifestyle choices have been linked to the development of various cardiovascular disorders, including atherosclerosis and hypertension. Furthermore, epigenetic mechanisms have been found to regulate chromatin structure and lineage-specific gene expression during cardiovascular development and disease. The development of new chromatin-modifying drugs indicates that targeting epigenetic changes is a promising approach to reduce the burden of cardiovascular disease.","there is a rapidly growing body of evidence that epigenetic modifications are involved in the pathological mechanisms of many cardiovascular diseases (cvds), which intersect with many of the pathways involved in oxidative stress.  this review will discuss the role of epigenetic mechanisms in heart development as well as aberrant epigenetic regulation contributing to cardiovascular disease.  epigenetic modifications of the genome, such as dna methylation and histone modifications, have been reported to play a role in processes underlying cardiovascular disease (cvd), including atherosclerosis, inflammation, hypertension and diabetes.  gene alterations have been found to be associated with cardiovascular diseases, and epigenetic mechanisms are continuously being studied to find new useful strategies for the clinical management of afflicted patients.  epigenetic modifications, such as histone or dna modifications are key regulators of gene transcription and changes are often associated with maladaptive processes underlying cardiovascular disease.  the purpose of this review is to summarize the newest results about the inheritable epigenetic features of cardiovascular diseases.  this review summarizes recent findings in the epigenetics of vascular cells and discusses the new challenges for therapeutic strategies of cardiovascular diseases.  the present study provided a direct evidence that dna methylation is a key epigenetic mechanism contributing to the developmental origins of adult cardiovascular disease.  this review summarizes the different epigenetic aspects involved in cardiac development and disease along with current therapeutic interventions.  epigenetic aberrations caused by environmental factors and lifestyle choices have been associated with the development of a number of pathologies, including cardiovascular disorders.  epigenetic modifications, especially alteration in dna methylation, are increasingly being recognized as a key factor in the pathogenesis of complex disorders, including atherosclerosis.  epigenetic mechanisms might play a role in the pathophysiology of hypertension, a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease and renal failure.  epigenetic mechanisms, including dna methylation and histone post-translational modifications (ptms), have been known to regulate chromatin structure and lineage-specific gene expression during cardiovascular development and disease.  several association studies have been carried out to elucidate the role of genetic variants in cardiovascular diseases (cvds), while studies on the epigenome regulating gene expression changes are helping to understand the development of disease and factors promoting such changes.  here, we describe main human epigenetic mechanisms involved in atherosclerosis, coronary heart disease, ischemic stroke, peripheral artery disease; cardiomyopathy and heart failure.  we also explore the establishment of epigenetic cues that may lead to hypertension at the vascular level such as dna methylation, histone modifications (methylation and acetylation), and the role of micrornas in the endothelial cells and blood vessel smooth muscle which participate in hypertension.  we aimed to systematically review studies investigating the association between epigenetic marks (global, candidate-gene or genome-wide methylation of dna, and histone modifications) and blood pressure or hypertension.  recent studies suggest that epigenetic changes which may arise as a consequence of environmental factors play an important role in predisposition to disease.  epigenetic modifications which are defined by dna methylation, histone modifications and microrna mediated gene regulation, have been found to be associated with cardiac dysfunction and cardiac regeneration but the mechanisms are unclear.  the development of new chromatin modifying drugs indicates that targeting epigenetic changes is a promising approach to reduce the burden of cardiovascular disease in this setting. ||| ",Yes

However, it is important to note that the incidence of hot flashes is still present in patients treated with anastrozole. The lower incidence of hot flashes with anastrozole compared to tamoxifen may be due to the fact that anastrozole reduces circulating estrogen, which is known to be associated with hot flashes. Despite the lower incidence of hot flashes with anastrozole, patients should still be aware of the potential for this side effect and discuss any concerns with their healthcare provider.","arimidex (anastrozole) is a potent aromatase inhibitor capable to induce an in-vivo milieu deprived of estradiol.  anastrozole (arimidex, 2,-2bis(2-met hyl)propiononitrile) is a novel, potent aromatase inhibitor belonging to the triazole class.  the arimidex (anastrozole), tamoxifen, alone or in combination (atac) trial was designed to compare the efficacy and safety of anastrozole with tamoxifen as adjuvant treatment for postmenopausal women with early-stage breast cancer.  objective: the hot flash is a common vasomotor disorder that causes distress in menopausal women and that can be debilitating in men with prostate cancer who are treated with androgen deprivation therapy (adt).  data from the 'arimidex', tamoxifen, alone or in combination (atac) trial have indicated that anastrozole ('arimidex') may supplant tamoxifen as the preferred adjuvant endocrine therapy for hormone receptor-positive, early breast cancer in postmenopausal women.  results from two studies, the north american trial and the tamoxifen or arimidex randomized group efficacy and tolerability (target) trial carried out in europe/rest of the world comparing 'arimidex' (anastrozole) 1 mg with tamoxifen 20 mg for treatment of advanced breast cancer in postmenopausal women, have previously been reported individually and as a prospectively combined analysis.  arimidex is a potent and selective aromatase inhibitor undergoing evaluation as a treatment for postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer.  in the 'arimidex', tamoxifen alone or in combination (atac) trial, the aromatase inhibitor (ai) anastrozole had a significantly better efficacy and safety profile than tamoxifen as initial adjuvant therapy for hormone receptor-positive (hr+) early breast cancer (ebc) in postmenopausal patients.  a 68-year-old woman was prescribed anastrozole after surgical removal of her breast cancer and adjuvant radiation therapy.  the arimidex, tamoxifen, alone or in combination (atac) trial (median follow-up, 68 months) has shown that adjuvant anastrozole has superior efficacy and better tolerability than tamoxifen.  anastrozole, a selective nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor is widely used as an adjuvant therapy for postmenopausal women with early hormone-sensitive breast cancer.  anastrozole, a nonsteroidal selective aromatase inhibitor, has recently been approved in the us and several other countries for the adjuvant treatment of postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive early breast cancer.  compared with tamoxifen, anastrozole was associated with a significantly lower incidence of vaginal bleeding, vaginal discharge, hot flushes, endometrial cancer, ischaemic cerebrovascular events, venous thromboembolic events and deep vein thrombosis including pulmonary embolism; tamoxifen was associated with a lower incidence of musculoskeletal disorders and fracture.  however, anastrozole reduces circulating estrogen, and low estradiol levels are associated with decreased bone mineral density (bmd) and increased fracture risk.  in the arimidex, tamoxifen alone or in combination (atac) trial, anastrazole 1mg was significantly more effective than tamoxifen 20mg or combined treatment (17 and 19% relative risk reduction) for disease-free survival in postmenopausal women with early breast cancer.  doses of 1 to 10 mg of arimidex suppressed estradiol to the maximum degree measurable.  at median follow-up of 68 months (range 1-93), treatment-related adverse events occurred significantly less often with anastrozole than with tamoxifen (1884  vs 2117 ; p<0.0001), as did treatment-related serious adverse events (146  vs 277 ; p<0.0001) and adverse events leading to withdrawal (344  vs 442 ; p=0.0002).  patients given anastrozole had significantly fewer overall events for the global index of the women's health initiative (744  vs 851 ; hazard ratio 0.85 , p=0.001) and the global index of disease-free survival and serious adverse events (1453  vs 1594 ; 0.88 ; p=0.0004).  anastrozole is associated with accelerated bone loss over the 5-year treatment period.  arimidex had no clinically significant effects on key enzymes that regulate cortisol and aldosterone biosynthesis. ||| ",Yes
Is paroxetine effective for treatment of premenstrual dysphoric disorder?,Yes,"The context suggests that paroxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), is an effective treatment for premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). Paroxetine has proven efficacy in the treatment of depression, panic disorder, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Anxiety and depression are common in PMDD, and these conditions have been linked to serotonergic dysregulation. The context also mentions that serotonergic antidepressants, such as fluoxetine and sertraline, have been shown to be effective treatments for PMDD. Although the context does not provide direct evidence for the efficacy of paroxetine in the treatment of PMDD, it suggests that paroxetine may be an effective treatment based on its mechanism of action and its proven efficacy in the treatment of other conditions that share features with PMDD.","serotonergic antidepressants have been shown to be effective treatments for premenstrual dysphoric disorder (pmdd).  fluoxetine is useful in the treatment of premenstrual dysphoria.  we evaluated the efficacy and safety of fluoxetine (which selectively inhibits the reuptake of serotonin) in the treatment of premenstrual dysphoria.  evidence that serotonergic antidepressants are effective for treating premenstrual syndrome (pms) raises the question of whether dosing only in the symptomatic premenstrual phase is effective for this disorder.  sertraline was significantly more effective than a placebo and was well tolerated as a treatment for premenstrual dysphoric disorder when administered intermittently during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle.  the goal of the current study was to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of sertraline for premenstrual dysphoric disorder when treatment was limited to the luteal phase.  this preliminary study compared the efficacy and tolerability of escitalopram administered at symptom onset or throughout the luteal phase in premenstrual dysphoric disorder (pmdd).  two hundred eighty-one women who met diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (4th edition) criteria for premenstrual dysphoric disorder and who completed two prospective screening cycles and one single-blind placebo cycle were randomized to three cycles of double-blind, luteal phase treatment with either a placebo or sertraline in a flexible daily dose of 50-100 mg.  premenstrual dysphoric disorder improved significantly with either luteal phase or symptom-onset dosing of escitalopram.  although research has established a strong association between premenstrual dysphoric symptoms and depression, there is little data on the effect of antidepressents on premenstrual symptoms.  paroxetine is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (ssri) with proven efficacy in the treatment of depression, panic disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder.  anxiety and depression commonly occur in premenstrual dysphoric disorder (pmdd).  these preliminary results suggest that fluoxetine is an effective and well-tolerated treatment for severe pms.  premenstrual dysphoria shares certain features with depression and anxiety states, which have been linked to serotonergic dysregulation.  premenstrual dysphoric disorder is a menstrually related disorder that intermittently causes disabling emotional, behavioral, and physical symptoms.  the results add support to other preliminary reports of efficacy of serotonergic antidepressants administered premenstrually and indicate the clinical importance of determining an optimal dose/benefit ratio of serotonergic antidepressants for pms patients.  this study determined if women with premenstrual dysphoric disorder (pms) showed impaired mood and performance when they were experiencing their premenstrual symptoms, and if the effects of alprazolam varied as a function of menstrual cycle phase.  paroxetine is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor commonly prescribed for the treatment of depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, panic disorder, social anxiety disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder.  taken together, these studies confirm that paroxetine is an effective and well tolerated treatment for patients with social anxiety disorder.  this study compared the efficacy of three treatments--imipramine, phenelzine, and placebo--on the premenstrual symptoms of women with atypical depression who had responded to treatment for their depressive symptoms. ||| ",Yes
Do plant genomes contain CpG islands?,Yes,"The study indicates that plant genomes, specifically those of rice and arabidopsis thaliana, contain DNA segments rich in CpG dinucleotides, which are referred to as CpG islands. These CpG-rich clusters in plant genomes satisfy the criteria used for identifying human CpG islands. The position of a plant CpG island within its associated gene appears to be related to the extent of tissue-specific expression of the gene. The CpG islands of most widely expressed rice genes occur near the 5'-end of the genes.","we screened plant genome sequences, primarily from rice and arabidopsis thaliana, for cpg islands, and identified dna segments rich in cpg dinucleotides within these sequences.  cpg islands mark cpg-enriched regions in otherwise cpg-depleted vertebrate genomes.  in this study, we performed a systematic analysis of cpg islands in ten mammalian genomes.  our study revealed that cpg islands vary greatly among mammalian genomes.  together, these findings indicate that functionally relevant variations of cpg islands exist.  cpg islands, which are clusters of cpg dinucleotides in gc-rich regions, are considered gene markers and represent an important feature of mammalian genomes.  cpg islands (cgis) are cpg-rich regions compared to cpg-depleted bulk dna of mammalian genomes and are generally regarded as the epigenetic regulatory regions in association with unmethylation, promoter activity and histone modifications.  it has been envisaged that cpg islands are often observed near the transcriptional start sites (tss) of housekeeping genes.  accurate identification of cpg islands with epigenetic regulatory function in bulk genomes is of wide interest.  our results show that prevention of methylation is an intrinsic property of cpg islands, recognized even if a human cpg island is transferred to a plant genome.  these plant cpg-rich clusters satisfied the criteria used for identifying human cpg islands, which suggests that these cpg clusters may be regarded as plant cpg islands.  for example, cpg islands in the human genome vary ∼30-fold in their lengths.  in the vertebrate genomes studied to date the 5' end of many genes are associated with distinctive sequences known as cpg islands.  regions with abundant gc nucleotides, a high cpg number, and a length greater than 200 bp in a genome are often referred to as cpg islands.  we found that both the number of cpg islands and their density vary greatly among genomes, though many of these genomes encode similar numbers of genes.  cpg islands, which have higher gc content and cpg frequencies compared to the genome as a whole, are generally believed to be unmethylated in tissues except at promoters of genes undergoing x chromosome inactivation or genomic imprinting.  cpg islands are discrete regions of dna with significantly greater frequencies of cpg doublets than bulk genomic dna.  a higher number of cpg islands were identified in chromosomes 21 and 22 of the human genome than with the other methods from the literature.  the position of a plant cpg island within its associated gene appeared to be related to the extent of tissue-specific expression of the gene; the cpg islands of most of the widely expressed rice genes occurred near the 5'-end of the genes.  a large proportion of the genes belonged to one of two classes, in which a cpg island occurred near the 5'-end of the gene or covered the whole gene region. ||| ",Yes
Is autosomal dominant inheritanced form of Osteogenesis imperfecta caused by mutations in the genes associated with collagen production?,Yes,"Justification: The autosomal dominant form of Osteogenesis imperfecta is indeed caused by mutations in the genes associated with collagen production. These mutations primarily occur in either the COL1A1 or COL1A2 genes, which encode the alpha 1 and alpha 2 chains of type I collagen, respectively. The mutations result in the production of defective or insufficient collagen, leading to the characteristic bone fragility and osteoporosis seen in this disorder.","classic osteogenesis imperfecta, an autosomal dominant disorder associated with osteoporosis and bone fragility, is caused by mutations in the genes for type i collagen.  osteogenesis imperfecta is inherited as a dominant disease because if one allele is mutated, it contributes a mutant, destructive subunit polypeptide to collagen, which requires many subunits to form normal, polymeric, collagenous structures.  osteogenesis imperfecta is a clinically heterogenous disease caused by defective collagen syntesis associated with a mutation in the col1a1 or col1a2 genes.  in general, osteogenesis imperfecta is caused by heterozygous mutations in either of the genes encoding the alpha 1 or alpha 2 chains of type i collagen (col1a1 and col1a2, respectively).  mutations in type i collagen result in autosomal dominant osteogenesis imperfecta, whereas mutations in either of two components of the collagen prolyl 3-hydroxylation complex (cartilage-associated protein  and prolyl 3-hydroxylase 1 ) cause autosomal recessive osteogenesis imperfecta with rhizomelia (shortening of proximal segments of upper and lower limbs) and delayed collagen folding.  in general, osteogenesis imperfecta (brittle bone disease) is caused by heterozygous mutations in the genes encoding the alpha 1 or alpha 2 chains of type i collagen (col1a1 and col1a2, respectively).  most cases are caused by an autosomal dominant mutation in either col1a1 or col1a2 gene encoding type i collagen.  osteogenesis imperfecta (oi) is the most common heritable bone fragility disorder, usually caused by dominant mutations in genes coding for collagen type i alpha chains, col1a1 or col1a2 osteocalcin (ocn) is now recognized as a bone-derived regulator of insulin secretion and sensitivity and glucose homeostasis.  autosomal dominant oi is caused by mutations in the genes (col1a1 or col1a2) encoding the chains of type i collagen.  osteogenesis imperfecta (oi) is a rare heritable skeletal disorder which is mainly caused by defected type i collagen.  osteogenesis imperfecta (oi) is a heritable connective tissue disorder usually characterized by either a reduction in the production of normal collagen i or the synthesis of abnormal collagen.  osteogenesis imperfecta (oi) is a genetic disorder of connective tissue characterized by bone fragility and alteration in synthesis and posttranslational modification of type i collagen.  osteogenesis imperfecta (oi) is a heritable bone fragility disorder that is usually due to dominant mutations in col1a1 or col1a2.  the aim of this study was to identify mutations and allelic variants of the col1a1 gene in patients with osteogenesis imperfecta (oi).  three of 10 children with lethal or severe osteogenesis imperfecta, who did not have a primary collagen defect yet had excess post-translational modification of collagen, were found to have a recessive condition resulting in crtap deficiency, suggesting that prolyl 3-hydroxylation of type i collagen is important for bone formation.  autosomal dominant forms result from mutations in either the col1a1 (collagen type i alpha-1 chain) or col1a2 (collagen type i alpha-2 chain) genes encoding the type i collagen.  in most cases an impaired collagen production due to mutations in col1a1 or col1a2 cause this hereditary bone fragility syndrome with an autosomal dominant inheritance.  mutations affecting the pro alpha 1(i) or pro alpha 2(i) collagen genes have been identified in each of the major clinical types of osteogenesis imperfecta.  osteogenesis imperfecta is a heritable disorder that causes bone fragility.  osteogenesis imperfecta (oi) is a hereditary bone disease characterized by decreased bone density and multiple fractures, usually inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. ||| ",Yes
Is LDB1-mediated enhancer looping dependent on cohesin?,No,"The context suggests that LDB1-mediated enhancer looping is not dependent on cohesin. This is supported by the observation that LDB1 can mediate enhancer-promoter looping in erythroid cells independent of mediator and cohesin. Furthermore, the cas9-directed tethering of mutant LDB1 to the β-globin promoter forced LCR loop formation in the absence of mediator or cohesin occupancy. Additionally, chromatin immunoprecipitation results indicate that cohesin is almost completely absent from validated and predicted LDB1-regulated erythroid enhancer-gene pairs. These findings suggest that LDB1-mediated enhancer looping is not dependent on cohesin.","the ldb1 complex mediates enhancer-gene interactions at the β-globin locus through ldb1 self-interaction.  recent experiments suggest that the formation of loops might be mediated by loop extrusion factor proteins such as cohesin.  these results uncouple enhancer-promoter looping from nuclear migration and transcription activation and reveal new roles for ldb1 in these processes.  our findings establish ldb1 as a critical effector of gata1-mediated loop formation and indicate that chromatin looping causally underlies gene regulation.  further, cas9-directed tethering of mutant ldb1 to the β-globin promoter forced lcr loop formation in the absence of mediator or cohesin occupancy.  both ldb1 and ctcf are required for enhancer-car2 looping, and the domain of ldb1 contacted by ctcf is necessary to rescue car2 transcription in ldb1-deficient cells.  here we show that ldb1 controls gene expression at multiple levels.  thus, lineage specific factors largely mediate enhancer-promoter looping in erythroid cells independent of mediator and cohesin.  moreover, encode data and our chromatin immunoprecipitation results indicate that cohesin is almost completely absent from validated and predicted ldb1-regulated erythroid enhancer-gene pairs.  ldb1 (lim-domain-binding 1) is a cofactor that participates in formation of transcriptional regulatory complexes involving transcription factors containing lim domains as well as other factors.  we find that an ldb1-bound enhancer upstream of carbonic anhydrase 2 (car2) activates its expression by interacting directly with ctcf at the gene promoter.  chromatin loops juxtapose distal enhancers with active promoters, but their molecular architecture and relationship with transcription remain unclear.  promoter-tethered ldb1 interacted with endogenous ldb1 complexes at the lcr to form a chromatin loop, causing recruitment and phosphorylation of rna polymerase ii.  to separate the roles of ldb1 and mediator in lcr looping, we expressed a looping-competent but transcription-activation deficient form of ldb1 in ldb1 knock down cells: lcr/β-globin proximity was restored without mediator core occupancy.  mechanistic studies in erythroid cells indicate that ldb1, as part of a gata1/tal1/lmo2 complex, brings erythroid-expressed genes into proximity with enhancers for transcription activation.  genome-wide studies and crispr/cas9 genome editing indicate that ldb1-ctcf enhancer looping underlies activation of a substantial fraction of erythroid genes.  these results implicate ldb1 as a factor that facilitates nuclear relocation for transcription activation.  these findings provide evidence that modification of lys134 can play a major role in regulating ldb1 expression.  we show that the ldb1 dimerization domain (dd) is necessary and, when fused to lmo2, sufficient to completely restore lcr-promoter looping and transcription in ldb1-depleted cells.  remarkably, targeting ldb1 or only its self-association domain to the β-globin promoter substantially activated β-globin transcription in the absence of gata1. ||| ",No

However, it is important to note that the use of retroviral vectors, especially those derived from murine oncoretroviruses, is associated with the risk of malignant transformation of infected cells and ectopic expression of the proteins of interest.","recombinant retroviruses are currently used as gene delivery vehicles for the purpose of gene therapy.  recombinant retroviruses are widely used for gene transfer into eukaryotic cells and exhibit significant potential for human gene therapy.  currently, a variety of retroviruses that provide distinct advantages for gene delivery has been modified and used in clinical trials.  retroviruses are used for a variety of applications requiring the delivery of exogenous genes to cells and animals.  recombinant retroviruses are a common vehicle to deliver an exogenous gene to a target cell, which makes them a useful tool in the field of gene therapy.  recombinant retroviruses are by far the most frequently used vehicle in clinical gene therapy.  several viral and physicochemical vehicles have been used for the transfer of genes to mammalian cells, but recombinant retroviruses are used in the majority of gene therapy clinical trials today.  retroviruses, adenoviruses, poxviruses, adeno-associated virus, herpesviruses, and others are being engineered to serve as gene therapy vectors and are being administered to patients in a clinical setting.  the ability to target the delivery and expression of therapeutic genes in vivo using retroviral vectors is a prerequisite for widespread and routine use in the clinic and will be of great importance for the safe and successful treatment of certain genetic disorders as well as tumors and viral infections.  retroviral vectors are one of the most promising vehicles for the delivery of therapeutic genes in human gene therapy protocols.  retroviruses are ideal tools for gene transfer into dividing cells both in vitro and in vivo, which has led to their expanding use in developing systems.  gene transfer vectors derived from gamma-retroviruses or lentiviruses are currently used for the gene therapy of genetic or acquired diseases.  processes for large-scale manufacturing of recombinant retroviruses that can produce high gene transfer efficiencies will have significant impact on the clinical implementation of gene therapy.  various modifications have been made to retroviral-based vectors and helper cells to alter gene expression, target delivery, improve viral titers, and increase safety.  retrovirus-derived gene transfer systems (retroviral vectors) are the most commonly used gene transfer tools in modern biology.  as with any delivery tool, the efficiency, the ability to target certain tissue or cell type, the expression of the gene of interest, and the safety of retroviral-based systems are important for successful application of gene therapy.  gene transfer vectors based on retroviridae are increasingly becoming a tool of choice for biomedical research and for the development of biotherapies in rare diseases or cancers.  the use of retroviral vectors (rvs) derived from the murine oncoretroviruses for gene therapy is associated with the risk of malignant transformation of infected cells and ectopic expression of the proteins of interest.  retroviruses and adenoviruses are among the most commonly used viral vectors in trials.  highly oncogenic retroviruses served as a model for the construction of artificial retroviral gene transfer systems. ||| ",Yes
Is there a sequence bias in MNase digestion patterns?,Yes,"The use of micrococcal nuclease (MNase) for the analysis of nucleosome organization has been found to exhibit a sequence preference, leading to a bias in the interpretation of nucleosome positions and occupancies. This sequence bias is evident in the discrepancy between the 1:1 ratio typically observed in heterozygous digestion products and the actual nucleosome organization. The presence of positional bias of motifs in DNA sequences further supports the existence of a sequence bias in MNase digestion patterns. The use of MNase-seq for the genome-wide examination of the nucleosome landscape has also revealed the existence of a sequence-dependent effect, despite the finding that the relative rate of incorporation of the correct nucleotide is essentially the same with Mg2+ and Mn2+. The presence of compositional heterogeneity in sequences also implies that the sequences must have evolved under more general conditions than is commonly assumed, further supporting the existence of a sequence bias in MNase digestion patterns.","next-generation sequencing (ngs) has also been utilized for analyses of mnase-digests, but some technical biases are commonly present in the ngs experiments.  this sequence-dependent effect was seen in spite of the finding that the relative rate of incorporation of the correct nucleotide at different positions on the template was essentially the same with mg2+ and mn2+.  however, due to its sequence preference, the interpretations of the positions and occupancies of nucleosomes using mnase have remained controversial.  digestion of chromatin with micrococcal nuclease (mnase) is widely used to probe nucleosome organization.  this discrepancy may be related to the bias towards a 1:1 ratio typically observed in heterozygous digestion products.  analysis of mnase digests by end-labeling techniques or overlapping quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qpcr) can be used to map locus-specific nucleosome positions.  commonly occurring sequence features, such as deletions and insertions, are known to affect the accuracy of msa programs, but the extent to which alignment accuracy is affected by the positions of insertions and deletions has not been examined independently of other sources of sequence variation.  here we report computer simulations which provide a simple estimator of genetic distances from the comparison of rnase a digestion patterns.  since m13mp8 and m13mp9 have their array of cloning sites in an antiparallel order, either orientation for inserting a double-digest fragment can be selected by the choice of the vector.  micrococcal nuclease (mnase) has been widely used for analyses of nucleosome locations in many organisms.  mnase-seq allows the genome-wide examination of the nucleosome landscape by determination of nucleosome positioning and occupancy.  previous work has highlighted the existence of positional bias of motifs in the dna sequences, which might indicate not only that the pattern is important, but also provide hints of the positions where these patterns occur preferentially.  although there was an overall greater tendency for misincorporation to occur in mn2+-activated chain elongation, some specific sites on the template were more prone to misincorporation with mg2+ and others with mn2+.  the presence of the above-mentioned compositional heterogeneity implies that the sequences must have evolved under more general conditions than is commonly assumed.  in data sets containing sequences with partially overlapping deletions, most msa programs preferentially aligned the gaps vertically at the expense of incorrectly aligning residues in the flanking regions.  however, from the same set of sequences different msas are often inferred, depending on the methodologies used and the assumed parameters.  we assessed the performance of 6 popular msa programs (clustalw, dialign-t, mafft, muscle, probcons, and t-coffee) and one experimental program, prank, on amino acid sequences that differed only by short regions of deleted residues.  here, we established a gel-based method to map nucleosome positions in saccharomyces cerevisiae, using isolated nuclei as the substrate for the histone h4 s47c-site-directed chemical cleavage in parallel with mnase digestion.  the results show that the number of non-shared fragments is proportional to the number of mutations between each pair of sequences compared.  the fidelity of e. coli dna polymerase i in the presence of mg2+ vs mn2+ was examined at many positions along natural dna templates, by use of an electrophoretic assay of misincorporation. ||| ",Yes
Is there evidence that tomato juice lowers cholesterol levels?,Yes,"The consumption of tomato juice has been shown to lead to a reduction in total cholesterol levels in various studies. In one study, the consumption of tomato juice resulted in a significant decrease in total cholesterol levels (l: 157.6 v. 153.2 mg/dl, p = 0.008; lc: 153.4 v. 147.4 mg/dl, p = 0.002) and that of crp (l: 315.6 v. 262.3 microg/l, p = 0.017; lc: 319.2 v. 247.1 microg/l, p = 0.001) in both groups. Another study found a significant improvement in the inflammation status and the endothelial dysfunction of the tomato-juice supplemented patients. Epidemiological evidence also suggests that tomato-based products could reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases, including chronic diseases such as cvd and cancer, via antioxidant, hypocholesterolaemic and anti-inflammatory mechanisms. Overall, interventions supplementing tomato were associated with significant reductions in ldl-cholesterol (-0.22 mmol/l; p = 0.006).","the consumption of tomato juice led to a reduction in total cholesterol levels (l: 157.6 v. 153.2 mg/dl, p = 0.008; lc: 153.4 v. 147.4 mg/dl, p = 0.002) and that of crp (l: 315.6 v. 262.3 microg/l, p = 0.017; lc: 319.2 v. 247.1 microg/l, p = 0.001) in both groups.  in the present study, we examined whether supplementation with tomato-juice has any implication on the risk status of patients with metabolic syndrome.  in conclusion, tomato juice may have favorable effects on lipid metabolism, but polyphenol fortification does not constitute additional beneficial cardiovascular effects.  a novel functional tomato sauce from vine-ripened tomatoes compares favourably with a commercialised sterol-enriched yogurt in term of absolute ldl-cholesterol change.  the results of the present study suggest an alleviating effect of tomato-juice with regard to risk factors associated with metabolic syndrome.  epidemiologic evidence suggests that tomato-based products could reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases.  epidemiological studies suggest that consumption of tomato products reduces the risk of cvd via antioxidant, hypocholesterolaemic and anti-inflammatory mechanisms.  raw tomato consumption produced a favorable effect on hdl-c levels in overweight women.  no significant differences were observed in the plasmatic parameters, except that hdl-cholesterol increased significantly after consumption of both tomato juices.  intake of a tomato sauce with a high carotenoid content may support treatment of patients affected by common hypercholesterolemia.  epidemiological evidence indicates that high consumption of tomatoes and tomato-based products reduces the risk of chronic diseases such as cvd and cancer.  the available evidence on the effects of tomato products and lycopene supplementation on cv risk factors supports the view that increasing the intake of these has positive effects on blood lipids, blood pressure and endothelial function.  epidemiological data have shown a link between dietary intake of tomatoes and tomato products (rich in carotenoids) and a decreased risk of chronic diseases.  overall, interventions supplementing tomato were associated with significant reductions in ldl-cholesterol (-0.22 mmol/l; p = 0.006), il-6 (standardised mean difference -0.25; p = 0.03), and improvements in fmd (2.53%; p = 0.01); while lycopene supplementation reduced systolic-bp (-5.66 mmhg; p = 0.002).  epidemiological evidence suggests an association between consumption of tomato products or lycopene and lower risk for cardiovascular diseases (cvd).  we found a greater ldl-cholesterol reduction in the participants with a basal ldl-cholesterol more than 152 mg/dl (15% for sterol-enriched yogurt and 12% for tomato sauce at high adherence).  we compared the effects of polyphenol-enriched and standard tomato juice on parameters of lipid and oxidative status and blood pressure in subjects with stage 1 hypertension.  a significant difference in ldl-cholesterol change was found between participants taking yogurt, tomato sauce (high adherence) and tomato sauce (low adherence) (- 16; - 12; + 8 mg/dl respectively; p < 0.001).  the aim of this study was to compare the lipid-lowering effect of a novel functional tomato sauce with a well-known functional food with a lipid-lowering effect, i.e.  there was a significant improvement in the inflammation status and the endothelial dysfunction of the tomato-juice supplemented patients. ||| ",Yes
Is muscle regeneration possible in mdx mice with the use of induced mesenchymal stem cells?,Yes,"The context suggests that muscle regeneration is possible in mdx mice using induced mesenchymal stem cells. Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (bm-mscs) have been shown to facilitate muscle regeneration in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) model mice. The mdx mouse, a model for DMD, has a greater regenerative capacity of its skeletal muscles compared to non-dystrophic animals. Muscle-derived stem cells (mdscs) isolated from mdx mice have displayed the capability to commit to the myogenic lineage and regenerate more efficiently than myoblasts in skeletal and cardiac muscle. The injection of normal myoblasts or muscle-derived stem cells into the muscle of dystrophin-deficient mdx mice results in the incorporation of donor myoblasts into the host muscle. Furthermore, the injection of mc13 cells results in muscle regeneration and partial restoration of dystrophin in mdx mice. Therefore, it can be concluded that muscle regeneration is possible in mdx mice with the use of induced mesenchymal stem cells.","we show here that bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (bm-mscs) also facilitate muscle regeneration in duchenne muscular dystrophy (dmd) model mice.  unlike dmd, skeletal muscles of mdx mice undergo successful regeneration and do not show extensive fibrosis and functional impairment.  adequate mitogenic activity in cme from mdx muscles may be related to successful muscle regeneration in mdx mice.  here, we have tested the hypothesis that muscles of mdx mice regenerate better than those of nondystrophic animals.  in the present study, we report the purification of muscle-derived stem cells from the mdx mouse, an animal model for duchenne muscular dystrophy.  the mdx mouse, a genetic homologue of human duchenne muscular dystrophy (dmd), has been attributed with a greater regenerative capacity of its skeletal muscles.  muscle-derived stem cells (mdscs) isolated from murine skeletal tissue by the preplate method have displayed the capability to commit to the myogenic lineage and regenerate more efficiently than myoblasts in skeletal and cardiac muscle in murine duchenne muscular dystrophy mice (mdx).  mdx mouse, the animal model of duchenne muscular dystrophy, develops an x-linked recessive inflammatory myopathy with an apparent sustained capacity for muscle regeneration.  our research group has isolated populations of muscle-derived stem cells (mdscs) from the postnatal skeletal muscle of mice.  the x-linked dystrophic animal model, the mdx mouse, shows an extraordinary capacity for sustained muscle regeneration compared with x-linked dystrophic golden retriever dogs and humans with duchenne muscular dystrophy.  we used the mdx mouse model of duchenne muscular dystrophy to investigate the effect of the host satellite cell niche on the contribution of donor muscle stem cells (satellite cells) to muscle regeneration.  it is well established that the injection of normal myoblasts or of muscle-derived stem cells (mdscs) into the muscle of dystrophin-deficient mdx mice results in the incorporation of a number of donor myoblasts into the host muscle.  in the dystrophic (mdx) mouse, skeletal muscle undergoes cycles of degeneration and regeneration, and myogenic progenitors (satellite cells) show ongoing proliferation and differentiation at a time when counterpart cells in normal healthy muscle enter quiescence.  to test the hypothesis that muscles of mdx mice might have inherently superior muscle regeneration to that in nondystrophic animals, muscle regeneration in response to a crush injury was examined in mdx mice and in the nondystrophic, parental strain c57bl/10sn.  in comparison with satellite cells, mdscs display an improved transplantation capacity in dystrophic mdx muscle that we attribute to their ability to undergo long-term proliferation, self-renewal, and multipotent differentiation, including differentiation toward endothelial and neuronal lineages.  however, efficient regeneration does not occur without muscle-resident mesenchymal progenitor cells.  we have previously reported that cd34(+) cells purified from mouse fetal muscles can differentiate into skeletal muscle in vitro and in vivo when injected into muscle tissue of dystrophic mdx mice.  little difference in the regenerative capacity, either histologically or with respect to the timing of muscle precursor replication, was found between mdx mice and c57bl/10sn or other nondystrophic strains of mice.  intramuscular, and more importantly, intravenous injection of mc13 cells result in muscle regeneration and partial restoration of dystrophin in mdx mice.  mdx mice uniquely recover from degenerative dystrophic lesions by an intense myoproliferative (regenerative) response. ||| ",Yes
Is Stat4 a transcription factor?,Yes,"Justification: Stat4 is a member of the signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) family of molecules. It localizes to the cytoplasm and is activated in response to IL-12. After phosphorylation, dimerization, and translocation to the nucleus, Stat4 functions as a transcription factor, regulating the expression of various genes. It plays a critical role in TH1 cell development and differentiation, and is required for TH1 development. The molecular mechanisms controlling the transcription of the Stat4 gene are not yet fully understood, but its function as a transcription factor is well established.","stat4 is a member of the signal transducer and activator of transcription (stat) family of molecules that localizes to the cytoplasm.  signal transducer and activator of transcription 4 (stat4) is a member of the stat family and localizes to the cytoplasm.  stat4 is a transcription factor activated in response to il-12, and is involved in th1 cell development.  stat4 regulates various genes expression as a transcription factor after it is phosphorylated, dimerizes and translocates to the nucleus.  signal transducer and activator of transcription (stat)6 is a transcription factor important for the development of th2 cells and regulation of gene expression by il-4 and il-13.  the stat transcription factor stat4 is a critical regulator of th1 differentiation and inflammatory disease.  stat4 is required for th1 development, although how a transiently activated factor generates heritable patterns of gene expression is still unclear.  these results further substantiate our observation that stat factors can function as transcriptional inhibitors.  the molecular mechanisms controlling the transcription of the stat4 gene are however, unclear.  we have investigated the mechanism by which stat6, through its transactivation domain, induces transcription.  stat (signal transducer and activator of transcription) proteins have been shown to be essential transcription factors which mediate biological effects of cytokines.  our previous studies showed that stat5 functions not only as a transcriptional activator but also as a transcriptional inhibitor, depending on the target promoter.  signal transducers and activators of transcription (stat) are latent transcription factors that participate in cytokine signaling by regulating the expression of early response genes.  the transcription factor stat6 plays a critical role in interleukin-4-dependent gene activation.  stat4 was initially cloned as a result of its homology with stat1 (refs 4, 5) and is widely expressed, although it is only tyrosine-phosphorylated after stimulation of t cells with interleukin (il)-12 (refs 6,7).  the molecular mechanisms by which transcription is selectively activated and precisely controlled by signal transducer and activator of transcription (stat) factors represent a central issue in cytokine-mediated cellular responses.  signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (stat6) has a crucial role in regulation of il-4-induced gene responses.  transcription factor sp4 is a member of the sp1 family.  interleukin-4 (il-4) stimulation leads to the activation of the signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (stat6).  stat6-mediated transcription is depend ent on the c-terminal transcription activation domain (tad), but the mechanisms by which stat6 activates transcription are poorly understood. ||| ",Yes
Have germline variants been associated to colorectal cancer?,Yes,"Justification: The context indicates that genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified several loci harboring variants that affect the risk of colorectal cancer. These variants are present in the germline sequence, and their inactivation, such as in E-cadherin, has been reported to confer susceptibility to colorectal cancer. The context also mentions that common but weakly penetrant mutations of certain genes may confer an increased susceptibility to colorectal cancer, and that multiple single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been associated with colorectal cancer risk. Therefore, it can be concluded that germline variants have been associated with colorectal cancer.","genome-wide association studies (gwas) have identified several loci harboring variants that affected the risk of colorectal cancer; however, the specific mechanisms by which germline variation influenced the tumorigenesis of colorectal cancer (crc) remains unrevealed.  inactivation of e-cadherin is common in colorectal cancer, and truncating germline mutations have been reported to confer susceptibility to colorectal as well as diffuse gastric cancer.  variability in molecular findings was present for colorectal cancers arising from acquired methylation, as well as those cancers suggestive of a germ line origin.  to determine if the at-risk single-nucleotide polymorphism (snp) alleles for colorectal cancer (crc) could contribute to clinical situations suggestive of an increased genetic risk for crc, we performed a prospective national case-control study based on highly selected patients (crc in two first-degree relatives, one before 61 years of age; or crc diagnosed before 51 years of age; or multiple primary crcs, the first before 61 years of age; exclusion of lynch syndrome and polyposes) and controls without personal or familial history of crc.  the genetics of sporadic and non-syndromic familial colorectal cancer (crc) is not well defined.  not only the tumor genome, but also the germline sequence must be analysed to depict the overall genetic profile, providing potential therapeutic strategies for personalized medicine.  common but weakly penetrant mutations of certain genes may confer an increased susceptibility to colorectal cancer and account for a proportion of 'sporadic' cases.  family history of colorectal cancer is a risk factor for sporadic colorectal cancer, but it is not known which step of the adenoma-carcinoma pathway it influences.  this case control study investigated the relation between family history of cancer and colorectal adenomas and cancers.  the molecular basis for most non-hnpcc familial colorectal cancer cases is unknown, but there is increasing evidence that common genetic variants may play a role.  our results suggest that several colorectal cancer susceptibility snps might also be related to survival by influencing disease progression.  multiple single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) have been associated with colorectal cancer (crc) risk.  a colorectal cancer may develop through a particular molecular genetic pathway, raising the question of whether the particular molecular changes are random, or are unique to the particular segment of colon.  patients with a colorectal cancer (n = 171) had more frequently a family history of cancer, both colorectal (15.8%; p < 0.01) and other cancers (35.7%; p < 0.001) than general population controls (n = 309; fhcrc: 8.1%; fhoc: 21.7%).  epidemiological studies indicate a genetic contribution to colorectal cancer (crc) and colorectal adenoma (cra) risk, but specific genetic variants remain unknown.  colorectal cancer (crc) is a common complex disease caused by the combination of genetic variants and environmental factors.  sporadic colorectal cancer is influenced by numerous single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps), each with minor effects on the cancer risk.  genome-wide association studies (gwas) have identified multiple single-nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) associated with colorectal cancer risk.  several genome wide association studies of colorectal cancer (crc) have identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) on chromosome 15q13.3 associated with crc risk.  to evaluate the potential influence of colorectal cancer susceptibility snps on disease prognosis, we investigated whether gwas-identified colorectal cancer risk snps and polygenic risk scores (prss) might be associated with survival among colorectal cancer patients. ||| ",Yes

Can tetracycline affect tooth formation?,Yes,"Tetracycline is known to adversely affect the color of developing teeth when administered to children or pregnant women. The incorporation of tetracycline into enamel and dentin is caused by physiochemical processes that may take place regardless of the developmental stage of the mineralized tissues. The distribution pattern of tetracycline in the developing dental hard tissues is greatly affected by pathologic changes induced by certain substances. Tetracycline solutions have been found to cause demineralization of enamel and dentin, incorporation of fluorescent material in enamel and dentin, and formation of yellow, rhombohedral crystals on dental surfaces. Furthermore, tetracyclines react with dental hard tissues to form long-lasting antimicrobial compounds and have a retarding effect on pellicle and plaque formation and an antienzymatic effect.

Is LPS a microbial product?,Yes,"The context provided indicates that Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a major component of the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria. It is an integral part of the outer cell membrane complex and is released as an endotoxin during infections. LPS is also referred to as a bacterial endotoxin and is known to participate in the induction of inflammatory responses.

Is acid alpha-glucosidase the enzyme that causes Pompe disease when mutant?,Yes,"The acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA) enzyme is the causative factor in Pompe disease when it is mutated. Pompe disease is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the GAA gene, which encodes the GAA enzyme. The deficiency of this enzyme results in the accumulation of glycogen in the lysosomes, leading to the clinical manifestations of Pompe disease.

Could transcription factors act as cell-cell signalling molecules?,No,"Transcription factors are proteins that regulate gene expression by binding to specific DNA sequences. They are involved in intracellular signaling pathways, where they respond to extracellular stimuli by modulating gene expression. However, transcription factors themselves do not act as cell-cell signaling molecules. Instead, they are part of the cell's response to signals transmitted by other molecules, such as hormones, growth factors, or cytokines, which bind to membrane receptors and trigger intracellular signaling cascades. These signaling pathways ultimately lead to the activation or repression of transcription factors, which in turn regulate the expression of target genes. Therefore, while transcription factors play a crucial role in cellular signaling, they do not function as cell-cell signaling molecules themselves.","the function of transcription factors is modulated by intracellular signal transduction pathways, which are activated by specific ligands binding to the appropriate membrane receptors.  transcription factors determine cell lineages, control cell fate, and regulate cellular responses to stimuli.  dominant-negative transcription factors can be used to investigate the effect of signaling pathways on complex cellular processes that are regulated by a particular transcription factor.  it is suggested that if such transcription factors also had a mechanism to sense the expression level of the gene they control, then they could create a feedback loop able to keep expression of a gene within a limited range.  transcription factors are proteins that recognize specific dna sequences and affect local transcriptional processes.  transcription factor signalling networks are branched and interconnected so that any single transcription factor can activate many different genes and one gene can be activated by a combination of different transcription factors.  moreover co-activators or transcription intermediary factors, have been identified which could mediate some of the transcriptional effects of the hormone-receptor complex.  transcription factors are regulatory proteins that bind to specific sites of chromosomal dna to enact responses to intracellular and extracellular stimuli.  nuclear receptors comprise a family of transcription factors that regulate gene expression in a ligand dependent manner.  information about transcription factor binding sites can help determine which combinations of factors work together to regulate a gene, but it is unclear how far the binding data from one cell type can inform about regulation in other cell types.  by integrating data on co-localized transcription factor binding sites in the k562 cell line with expression data across 38 distinct hematopoietic cell types, we developed regression models to describe the relationship between the expression of target genes and the transcription factors that co-localize nearby.  transcription factors are involved in this regulatory process through their combinatorial binding with dna.  synergistic interaction between different classes of transcription factors bound to distinct sites within a promoter/enhancer region is one mechanism by which this can occur.  evidence from transfection studies and cell-free assays points to an interaction of the hormone receptors with general transcription factors, as well as with sequence-specific transcription factors.  understanding which dna sequences a particular transcription factor recognizes provides important clues into the set of genes that they regulate and, through this, their potential biological functions.  members of transcription factor families typically have similar dna binding specificities yet execute unique functions in vivo.  dna-binding transcription factors regulate the expression of genes near to where they bind.  ligand-dependent transcriptional regulation by nuclear receptors is believed to be mediated by intermediary factors (tifs) acting on remodelling of the chromatin structure and/or the activity of the transcriptional machinery.  identification of transcription factor (tf) activities associated with a certain physiological/experimental condition is one of the preliminary steps to reconstruct transcriptional regulatory networks and to identify signal transduction pathways.  our approach shows that gene expression can be explained by a modest number of co-localized transcription factors, however, information on cell-type specific binding is crucial for understanding combinatorial gene regulation. ||| ",Yes

Do all archaea possess multiple origins of DNA replication?,No,"The context indicates that while the majority of archaea possess multiple replication origins, not all archaea exhibit this characteristic.

This diversity in DNA replication initiation mechanisms is remarkable, having been discovered in only a few groups of archaea where in vivo studies are possible. The use of multiple replication origins in archaea is not yet fully understood, and further research is needed to fully comprehend the mechanisms governing DNA replication in archaea.","while some archaea possess a bacterial-like mode of dna replication with single origins of replication per chromosome, the majority of species characterized to date possess chromosomes with multiple replication origins.  furthermore, recent work has shown that archaea, like eukaryotes, have multiple replication origins.  the use of multiple origins for chromosome replication has been demonstrated in archaea.  two studies have shown that multiple origins of replication function in two archaeal species.  dna replication is initiated at origins and is highly conserved in eukaryotes, but our limited understanding of archaea has uncovered a wide diversity of replication initiation mechanisms.  the use of multiple replication origins in archaea is not well understood.  bacteria and some archaea replicate from single origins, whereas most archaea and all eukaryotes replicate using multiple origins.  archaea, the third domain of life, use a single or multiple origin(s) to initiate replication of their circular chromosomes.  this review summarizes the research progress in understanding of archaeal replication origins with particular focus on the utilization, control and evolution of multiple replication origins in haloarchaea.  this review summarizes the search for origins of replication in archaea, and our current knowledge of initiation, the process by which replication origins are recognized, the dna molecule is unwound and the replicative helicase is loaded onto the dna in preparation for dna synthesis.  these are the first reports of archaea having multiple origins.  similar to the dormant origins in eukaryotes, some potential origins in archaea appear to be inactive during genome replication.  unlike bacteria, archaea may have multiple origins per chromosome and multiple orc1/cdc6 initiator proteins.  this is the first report revealing diverse control mechanisms of origins in haloarchaea, which has provided novel insights into the use and coordination of multiple replication origins in the domain of archaea.  in this review, the current knowledge of the mechanisms governing dna replication in archaea is summarized.  archaea therefore have a unique replication system showing mechanistic similarities to both bacteria and eukarya.  the recently published complete genome sequences of some archaeal species together with preliminary biochemical studies suggest that the archaea quite likely duplicate their chromosome by using replication machinery that seems to be a simplified version of the eukaryotic machinery, although their metabolic facets and their cellular morphology are prokaryotic-like.  the basic structure of replication origins is conserved among archaea, typically including an at-rich unwinding region flanked by several conserved repeats (origin recognition box, orb) that are located adjacent to a replication initiator gene.  these results indicate that origin-dependent replication is strictly required for h. mediterranei and that dormant replication origins in archaea can be activated if needed.  this diversity in dna replication initiation is all the more remarkable for having been discovered in only three groups of archaea where in vivo studies are possible. ||| ",No

Is desmin an intermediate filament protein involved in Dilated Cardiomyopathy (DCM)?,Yes,"Desmin, an intermediate filament protein, plays a crucial role in maintaining the structural integrity and cytoskeletal organization of cardiomyocytes. Recent studies have confirmed that a missense mutation in the gene encoding desmin can cause dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). Desmin-related cardiomyopathy is characterized by the aggregation of desmin and related proteins in myocytes. The exon 8 of the desmin gene, critical for the pathogenesis of DCM, has been analyzed. It has been suggested that the remodeling of the desmin cytoskeleton might contribute to the progression of idiopathic DCM. The accumulation of cleaved and misfolded desmin is a hallmark of heart failure. In patients with idiopathic DCM, a decrease or lack of desmin expression is a strong predictor of an unfavorable prognosis. Mutations in the human desmin gene cause cardiac disease, remodeling, and heart failure.

They are key mediators in cardiac excitation, and their homeostasis is central to the regulation of cardiac contractility. Calcium cycling is crucial in the excitation-contraction coupling of cardiomyocytes, thereby having a significant role in cardiac functionality. Disturbed myocardial calcium handling is a hallmark of various cardiovascular diseases, including heart failure, cardiac hypertrophy, and certain types of tachyarrhythmias. Abnormal calcium homeostasis is often associated with chronic cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension, heart failure, or cardiac arrhythmias. Proper cardiac calcium homeostasis is essential for normal excitation-contraction coupling, and disruption of myocellular calcium handling can lead to cardiac pathologies such as arrhythmias and heart failure.","calcium homeostasis in the cardiomyocyte is critical to the regulation of normal cardiac function.  calcium has a fundamental role in the maintenance of myocardial function and vascular tone.  altered calcium homeostasis may play a key role in the pathophysiology of human heart failure.  calcium ions are important in many aspects of normal cardiac function as well as in the response to certain pathologic states.  the significance of abnormal calcium homeostasis under conditions of heart failure, myocardial infarction, ventricular fibrillation and cardiomyopathy is examined.  calcium (ca2+) is a key player in cardiomyocyte homeostasis, and its roles span from excitation-contraction coupling to metabolic and structural signaling.  calcium is an important mediator in cardiac excitation and disorders in cardiac ca(2+) homeostasis have great influence on the cardiac action potential.  calcium cycling is crucial in the excitation-contraction coupling of cardiomyocytes, and therefore has a key role in cardiac functionality.  a specific calcium-sensing receptor on cardiac myocytes could play a role in regulating cardiac development, function, and homeostasis.  disturbed myocardial calcium (ca(+)) handling is one of the pathophysiologic hallmarks of cardiovascular diseases such as congestive heart failure, cardiac hypertrophy, and certain types of tachyarrhythmias.  calcium (ca2+) is a key mediator of myocardial function.  the control of intracellular calcium is central to regulation of cardiac contractility.  in this review, we summarize the role of local ca(2+) homeostasis in these processes in healthy cardiac muscle cells, and highlight how mismanaged ca(2+) handling contributes to the pathophysiology of conditions such as cardiac arrhythmia, ischemic heart disease, cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure.  abnormal ca(2+)homeostasis is often associated with chronic cardiovascular diseases, such as hypertension, heart failure or cardiac arrhythmias, and typically contributes to the basic ethiology of the disease.  the role of calcium in the mediation of myocardial damage under conditions of ischemia and secondary to a phenomenon known as 'the calcium paradox' is discussed.  proper cardiac ca2+ homeostasis is essential for normal excitation-contraction coupling.  calcium regulates contraction, and disruption of myocellular ca2+ handling plays a role in cardiac pathologies such as arrhythmias and heart failure.  cardiac disorders and different drugs alter the calcium transients of cardiomyocytes and can cause serious dysfunction of the heart.  both intra- and extracellular calcium play multiple roles in the physiology and pathophysiology of cardiomyocytes, especially in stimulus-contraction coupling.  however, proteins involved in calcium removal were significantly altered in the failing human heart: (1) sr-ca(2+)-atpase levels and the ratio of sr-ca(2+)-atpase to its inhibitory protein phospholamban were significantly decreased, and (2) na(+)-ca2+ exchanger levels and the ratio of na(+)-ca2+ exchanger to sr-ca(2+)-atpase were significantly increased. ||| ",Yes
Is bapineuzumab effective for treatment of patients with Alzheimer's disease?,No,"Bapineuzumab, a humanized anti-amyloid-beta monoclonal antibody, was evaluated in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease. Despite demonstrating target engagement with brain amyloid-beta and inducing exposure-dependent reductions in brain amyloid burden, bapineuzumab did not improve clinical outcomes in patients with Alzheimer's disease. The preliminary cognitive efficacy of bapineuzumab appears uncertain, and it did not demonstrate a significant treatment difference over placebo on cerebral amyloid signal at one year. Therefore, bapineuzumab is not considered an effective treatment for patients with Alzheimer's disease.","bapineuzumab appears capable of reducing the cerebral beta-amyloid peptide burden in patients with alzheimer's disease.  bapineuzumab, an anti-β-amyloid monoclonal antibody, was evaluated in patients with mild to moderate alzheimer disease.  the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (pks) of bapineuzumab (aab-001), a humanized monoclonal antibody to amyloid beta, were evaluated in patients with mild-to-moderate alzheimer disease in a phase 1, randomized, third-party unblinded, placebo-controlled, single ascending dose trial.  bapineuzumab, a humanized anti-amyloid-beta (abeta) monoclonal antibody for the potential treatment of alzheimer disease (ad), was evaluated in a multiple ascending dose, safety, and efficacy study in mild to moderate ad.  bapineuzumab, a humanized anti-amyloid-beta monoclonal antibody, is in clinical development for the treatment of alzheimer's disease.  we performed this systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the safety and efficacy of bapineuzumab in patients with mild to moderate alzheimer's disease.  bapineuzumab, an anti-amyloid monoclonal antibody, was evaluated as a candidate for immunotherapy in mild-to-moderate alzheimer's disease (ad) patients.  bapineuzumab, an anti-amyloid-β monoclonal antibody, was evaluated in two placebo-controlled trials in apoe*ɛ4 carriers and noncarriers, respectively, with alzheimer's disease.  bapineuzumab did not improve clinical outcomes in patients with alzheimer's disease, despite treatment differences in biomarkers observed in apoe ε4 carriers.  bapineuzumab is a humanized anti-amyloid-beta (aβ) monoclonal antibody directed at lowering the cerebral aβ deposit in alzheimer's disease (ad).  bapineuzumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody, targets amyloid-β (aβ1-40/1 -42) that is believed to play a key role in the pathogenesis of alzheimer disease (ad).  bapineuzumab demonstrated target engagement with brain aβ, consistent with published clinical data.  bapineuzumab treatment induced exposure-dependent reductions in brain amyloid burden.  bapineuzumab is a fully humanized monoclonal antibody that binds to neurotoxic amyloid proteins in the brain, enhancing their clearance.  bapineuzumab sc once-monthly did not demonstrate significant treatment difference over placebo on cerebral amyloid signal at one year but was well-tolerated.  clinical studies using the n-terminal-directed anti-aβ antibody bapineuzumab have demonstrated reduced brain pet-pittsburg-b signals, suggesting the reduction of aβ plaques, and reduced levels of total and phosphorylated tau protein in the csf of treated ad patients.  however, the preliminary cognitive efficacy of bapineuzumab, a humanized anti-aβ monoclonal antibody, appears uncertain.  at week 71, bapineuzumab-treated participants with aria-e vs non-aria-e showed greater reduction in brain amyloid pet, greater reductions in csf phosphorylated tau (p-tau) (all comparisons p < 0.01), and total tau (t-tau) (all comparisons p < 0.025), and greater hippocampal volume reduction and ventricular enlargement (all p < 0.05).  this phase 2, open-label extension (ole) study evaluated long-term safety and efficacy of bapineuzumab in patients with the mild-to-moderate ad.  gantenerumab appears capable of reducing the cerebral β-amyloid peptide burden in patients with alzheimer's disease. ||| ",No
Does GC content vary markedly within a given isochore?,No,"The GC content within a given isochore does not vary markedly. Isochores are defined as regions of the genome with relatively homogeneous GC content, and they are distinguished from neighboring regions by a sharp change in GC content at the boundaries. While the GC content of different isochores can vary significantly, the GC content within a single isochore is relatively uniform. This uniformity is a defining characteristic of isochores and is thought to be maintained by a variety of evolutionary processes, including mutation biases and selection for specific GC content.","gc content varies greatly between different genomic regions in many eukaryotes.  mammalian genomes consist of regions differing in gc content, referred to as isochores or gc-content domains.  in general, gc-poor isochores tend to be longer than gc-rich ones.  the regional variation in gene g + c content might therefore be a reflection of the isochore structure of chromosomes, but the factors influencing the variation of nucleotide substitution rate are still open to question.  indeed, after correcting for possible biases, we show that intron gc content and size display isochore-specific correlations.  moreover, we demonstrated that the regional similarities in g + c content (isochores) and synonymous substitution rate were independent of each other.  bacterial genomes possess varying gc content (total guanines (gs) and cytosines (cs) per total of the four bases within the genome) but within a given genome, gc content can vary locally along the chromosome, with some regions significantly more or less gc rich than on average.  the variation of gc content is a key genome feature because it is associated with fundamental elements of genome organization.  most studies of this relationship have examined broad-scale compositional patterns, for example, total gc percentages in genomes and occurrence of gc-rich isochores.  (4) the true uniqueness of the human (or mammalian) genome is the presence of very high gc regions, which exhibit unusually high compositional heterogeneity and contain few long homogeneous segments (isochores).  variations in gc content between genomes have been extensively documented.  we have examined how the gc content varies within microbial genomes to assess whether this property can be associated with certain biological functions related to the organism's environment and phylogeny.  in order to determine whether this organization named isochore organization influences gene expression patterns, the relationship between gc content and gene expression has been investigated in man and mouse.  genomes with comparable gc contents can, however, still differ in the apportionment of the g and c nucleotides between the two dna strands.  our study indicates that, whereas gc contents of isochores may show variation among different classes of vertebrates, there is no consistent relationship between adaptation temperature and the percentage of thermal stability-enhancing g + c base pairs in protein-coding genes.  additionally, different window sizes result in different gc content distribution patterns within the same genome.  variation in gc content is assumed to correlate with various processes, including mutation biases, recombination, and environmental parameters.  it has been proposed that the mammalian genome comprises a mosaic of regions - termed isochores - with differing g + c content.  gc content, an important characteristic for a genome, is related to many important functions, and therefore gc content and its distribution are routinely reported for sequenced genomes.  we utilize a new quantity gcvar, the intra-genomic gc content variability with respect to the average gc content of the total genome. ||| ",No
Has Revlimid been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration?,Yes,"Information

     The provided context does not contain information regarding the approval status of Revlimid by the US Food and Drug Administration. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether Revlimid has been approved by the US FDA based solely on the given context.","since its approval in 1997 by the fda (united states food and drug administration), rituximab has been used for certain b-cell lymphomas and treatment-resistant rheumatoid arthritis.  this report summarizes the u.s. food and drug administration (fda)'s approval of temsirolimus (torisel), on may 30, 2007, for the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma (rcc).  vilazodone was recently approved by the us food and drug administration (fda) for the treatment of major depressive disorder (mdd).  after public hearings in july 2010, and june 2011, the fda revoked this approved indication in november 2011, on the basis of additional evidence regarding its risk/benefit profile.  preliminary results were presented at the mountain states conference for residents and preceptors in may 2019 in salt lake city, ut, and at an encore presentation october 2019 at the american college of clinical pharmacy annual meeting in new york, ny.  rituximab is a top-selling biologic that was first approved by the fda in 1997 for a non-hodgkin lymphoma orphan indication.  when venlafaxine was introduced in 1994, it was the first of the newer generation antidepressants to be classified as a serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (snri).  we investigate why, despite internal negative opinions and an advisory committee's non-approval recommendation, the fda approved relenza in the late 1990s.  everolimus was recently approved by the food and drug administration for use in liver transplantation.  by law, the commissioner of the food and drug administration (fda) is responsible for determining whether a new drug is safe and efficacious before it is approved for marketing in the u.s. and for monitoring its use after approval.  an extended release (xr) formulation of venlafaxine, introduced in 1997, subsequently received regulatory approval for treatment of three anxiety disorders: generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder and panic disorder.  in february 2008, the us food and drug administration (fda) granted accelerated approval for bevacizumab for metastatic breast cancer.  the purpose of this review is to summarize the fda's approach to its review of the clinical pharmacology and the clinical efficacy and safety data for this new drug application, important issues in its decision-making, and its conclusions.  it has since been approved for additional orphan indications, with rheumatoid arthritis as the only fda-approved, nonorphan indication.  a major activity occupying the u.s. food and drug administration for several years has been a rewrite of the fda's ind and nda regulations which govern the clinical testing of investigational new drugs and the process for subsequent market approval for those drug entities.  the us food and drug administration (fda) is open to accepting real-world evidence (rwe) to support its assessment of medical products.  we conducted a systematic review of publicly available fda approval documents from january 2019 to june 2021.  the food and drug administration (fda) has determined the regulatory review period for therma choice5 uterine ballon therapy system and is publishing this notice of that determination as required by law.  multivariable logistic regression modeling was performed to assess factors associated with receiving rituximab for an fda-approved indication.  on october 6, 2006, the u.s. food and drug administration granted regular approval to vorinostat (zolinza(r); merck & co., inc., whitehouse station, nj), a histone deacetylase inhibitor, for the treatment of cutaneous manifestations of cutaneous t-cell lymphoma (ctcl) in patients with progressive, persistent, or recurrent disease on or following two systemic therapies. ||| ",Yes
Has the gorilla genome been determined?,Yes,"The genome sequence for the western lowland gorilla has been presented and analyzed, and the majority of the gorilla genome is reported to be occupied with mobile genetic elements (MGEs), including long terminal repeats (LTRs) and non-LTRs such as Alus and L1s. The draft genome sequence of Lactobacillus gorillae strain KZ01(T) isolated from a western lowland gorilla has also been reported. Furthermore, a 6.0-kb DNA fragment from the gorilla gorilla genome, including the 5' part of the beta-globin gene and about 4.5 kb of its upstream flanking region, has been cloned and sequenced. Two fetal globin genes (G gamma and A gamma) from one chromosome of a lowland gorilla have been sequenced and compared to three human loci. These findings suggest that the gorilla genome has been determined to a certain extent.","here we present the assembly and analysis of a genome sequence for the western lowland gorilla, and compare the whole genomes of all extant great ape genera.  here we report that majority of gorilla genome is occupied with mges (> 36%) with presence of ltrs and non-ltrs such as alus and l1s.  recently published gorilla genome has offered an opportunity to study human evolution through variety of approaches.  we describe a novel application of ""forensic"" genetics to study a key demographic event in a population of wild gorillas.  here we present dna sequences from 16 noncoding autosomal loci from 15 western gorillas and 3 eastern gorillas, including 2 noninvasively sampled free-ranging individuals.  this review summarizes what is currently known concerning genetic variation in gorillas, on both inter- and intraspecific levels.  relatively little is known about the evolutionary and demographic histories of gorillas, one of our closest living relatives.  after chimpanzees and bonobos, gorillas are humans' closest living relatives; but in contrast, relatively little is known about the structure and variation of gorilla mhc class i genes (gogo).  here, we report the draft genome sequence of lactobacillus gorillae strain kz01(t) isolated from a western lowland gorilla (gorilla gorilla gorilla).  a 6.0-kb dna fragment from gorilla gorilla including the 5' part of the beta-globin gene and about 4.5 kb of its upstream flanking region was cloned and sequenced.  genetic studies focusing on individual identification may play a valuable role in future gorilla conservation efforts.  this study examines neuroanatomical variation between gorilla species using structural neuroimaging.  we generated genetic profiles for a sampling of an unstudied population of grauer's gorillas from within the species' core range at 13 autosomal microsatellite loci and combined them with previously published and newly generated data from four other grauer's gorilla populations, two mountain gorilla populations, and one western lowland gorilla population.  although gorillas regarded as the largest extant species of primates and have a close phylogenetic relationship with humans, eukaryotic communities have not been previously studied in these populations.  revised estimates of the amount and pattern of mitochondrial dna diversity in gorillas are provided, revealing two reciprocally monophyletic and highly divergent groups of gorillas, concurrent with their geographic distribution.  we used microsatellite genotyping and non-invasively collected dna samples to identify one individual western lowland gorilla as being most likely to have caused the death of another in lopé national park, gabon.  we determined a mitochondrial dna sequence from one of these specimens and compared it to sequences from other gorillas.  two fetal globin genes (g gamma and a gamma) from one chromosome of a lowland gorilla (gorilla gorilla gorilla) have been sequenced and compared to three human loci (a g gamma-gene and two a gamma-alleles).  in 30% of the genome, gorilla is closer to human or chimpanzee than the latter are to each other; this is rarer around coding genes, indicating pervasive selection throughout great ape evolution, and has functional consequences in gene expression.  in comparison to their close relatives the chimpanzees and humans, very little is known concerning the amount and structure of genetic variation in gorillas. ||| ",Yes
Are chromomethylases present in animal genomes?,No,"The context does not provide information on the presence of chromomethylases in animal genomes. The focus of the context is on the presence of beta-carbonic anhydrase (CA) enzymes in various organisms, including animals. The study investigates the distribution and numbers of eccDNAs in the genome of the domestic rock pigeon, and confirms the presence of beta-CA sequences in 55 metazoan species. However, there is no mention of chromomethylases in the context. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the presence of chromomethylases in animal genomes based on the provided information.","the beta-carbonic anhydrase (ca, ec 4.2.1.1) enzymes have been reported in a variety of organisms, but their existence in animals has been unclear.  here, we sequenced the mitochondrial genomes of cephalonomia gallicola (chrysidoidea: bethylidae) and wallacidia oculata (vespoidea: mutillidae).  animal-type photolyases have very limited sequence homology to microbial-type photolyases.  the c3 and factor b genes, but probably not the other complement genes, are present in the genome of the cnidaria and some protostomes, indicating that the origin of the central part of the complement system was established more than 1,000 mya.  the ability to obtain large amounts of genomic sequence for organisms and high throughput technology has led to a change in the thrust of research at the level of chromosomes in animals.  here, we investigate the distribution and numbers of eccdnas in a condensed and less repeat-rich genome compared with the human genome, using columba livia domestica (domestic rock pigeon) as a model organism.  the novel beta-ca gene, here named dmbca, was identified from flybase, and its orthologs were searched and reconstructed from sequence databases, confirming the presence of beta-ca sequences in 55 metazoan species.  in the hymenoptera, three types of protein-coding gene rearrangement events occur, i.e.  members of most complement gene families are also present in ascidians, although they do not show a one-to-one correspondence to their counterparts in higher vertebrates, indicating that the gene duplications of each gene family occurred independently in vertebrates and ascidians.  the purpose of the present study was to perform extensive sequence analysis to show that the beta-cas are present in invertebrates and to clone and characterize a member of this enzyme family from a representative model organism of the animal kingdom, e.g., drosophila melanogaster.  the recent accumulation of genomic information of many representative animals has made it possible to trace the evolution of the complement system based on the presence or absence of each complement gene in the analyzed genomes.  sequencing projects have revealed the information of many animal genomes and thereby enabled the exploration of genome evolution.  in the last years, chromosome conformation capture experiments (4c-seq, 5c, and hic) in several organisms have shown that the genomes of many bilaterian animals are organized in the 3d chromatin space in compartments called topologically associated domains (tads).  the chromosome complements (karyotypes) of animals display a great diversity in number and morphology.  overall, our results support that eccdnas are common in pigeons, that the amount of unique eccdna types per nucleus can differ between species as well as subspecies, and suggest that eccdnas from repeats are found in proportions relative to the content of repetitive elements in a genome.  against this background, the genomes of all species are remarkably conserved, not only in transcribed sequences, but also in some chromosome-specific non-coding sequences and in gene order.  in particular, the chromophore/cofactor composition of animal photolyases is of special interest since the presence and nature of a second chromophore in these enzymes are not known in contrast to the microbial photolyases which contain fad cofactor, and folate or deazaflavin as second chromophores.  this conclusion is supported by the phylogenetic distribution and prevalence of metameric phyla in the cambrian, and the similarity of the genomes and segmentation mechanisms across current bilaterian phyla.  vertebrate genomes are mosaics of isochores.  phylogenetic and ancestral state reconstruction analysis revealed an arthropod-specific set gene family, named smyda, that is ancestral to arthropod animals and specifically diversified during insect evolution. ||| ",No
Are splicing speckles associated with transcription?,Yes,"It has been observed that upon transcriptional activation of a gene in vivo, pre-mRNA splicing factors are recruited from nuclear speckles to sites of transcription. This suggests that nuclear speckles play a role in modulating the concentration of splicing factors in the nucleoplasm to regulate alternative pre-mRNA splicing. Furthermore, the speckled localization of pre-mRNA splicing factors is a reflection of the transcriptional and pre-mRNA splicing activities of the cell. In actively transcribing cells, factors involved in pre-mRNA splicing localize in a speckled pattern at the fluorescence microscopic level. The speckled distribution of splicing factors in the nucleus is altered when either transcription or pre-mRNA splicing activities are interrupted, suggesting that the organization of the splicing machinery in the interphase nucleus is a direct reflection of the transcriptional activity of the cell.","we conclude that one function of speckles is to supply splicing factors to active genes.  when single genes are transcriptionally activated in living cells, splicing factors leave speckles in peripheral extensions and accumulate at the new sites of transcription.  we have previously shown that upon transcriptional activation of a gene in vivo, pre-mrna splicing factors are recruited from nuclear speckles, in which they are concentrated, to sites of transcription (misteli, t., j.f.  these results suggest that nuclear speckles play a role in modulating the concentration of splicing factors in the nucleoplasm to regulate alternative pre-mrna splicing.  their targeting into and accumulation in the speckles is a result of the cumulative loading of splicing factors to the pre-mrna and the complexes formed give rise to the speckled pattern observed.  nuclear speckles are thought to be involved in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression, such as pre-mrna splicing.  furthermore, these data demonstrate that the speckled localization of pre-mrna splicing factors is a reflection of the transcriptional and pre-mrna splicing activities of the cell.  speckles are nuclear bodies that contain pre-mrna splicing factors and polyadenylated rna.  the function of speckles and the organization of cellular transcription and pre-mrna splicing in vivo are not well understood.  in this study, we show that, in hela cells, the (pre)spliceosomal assembly on precursor mrna (pre-mrna) is associated with the speckles.  in actively transcribing cells, factors involved in pre-mrna splicing localize in a speckled pattern at the fluorescence microscopic level.  in the mammalian cell nucleus, splicing factors are distributed in nuclear domains known as speckles or splicing factor compartments (sfcs).  however, previous studies have localized splicing factors to a network of ""speckles,"" which is distinct from individual sites of gene transcription where pre-mrna is spliced.  although nuclear speckles are thought to represent reservoirs from which splicing factors are recruited to sites of transcription and splicing, the presence of poly(a) rna in these structures remains enigmatic.  several of the rna substrates with which these factors interact have been shown to localize in tracks that are associated with regions in which splicing factors are concentrated (nuclear speckles).  the speckled distribution of splicing factors in the nucleus is altered when either transcription or pre-mrna splicing activities are interrupted suggesting that the organization of the splicing machinery in the interphase nucleus is a direct reflection of the transcriptional activity of the cell.  accumulation of rna from various actively transcribed speckle-associated genes could contribute to the observed speckle size variations within a single cell.  within the mammalian cell nucleus, most splicing factors are concentrated in 20-40 distinct domains called speckles.  in a previous study (melcák et al., 2001), it has been shown that the pre-spliceosomal assembly on microinjected splicing-competent precursor mrna takes place in the speckles, and it has been suggested that the targeting of rna into speckes consists of two interdependent steps, namely the diffusion process, followed by the energy-dependent translocation of rna into the speckles.  speckles have been detected with antibodies specific for splicing snrnps and members of the sr family of splicing factors. ||| ",No
Are there any functional differences between Mfd and its human Cocaine syndrome protein B (CSB) homolog?,Yes,"The context suggests that there are functional differences between Mfd and its human Cocaine syndrome protein B (CSB) homolog. The catalytic efficiency of Mcoch against (-)-cocaine is remarkably lower than that of Hcoch by ~250-fold. This indicates a significant difference in the functional efficiency of these two proteins in the context of cocaine metabolism. Furthermore, the context also mentions that the remarkable difference in the catalytic activity between Mcoch and Hcoch is consistent with the difference between the enzyme-(-)-cocaine binding modes obtained from molecular modelling. This further supports the notion of functional differences between these two proteins.","we conclude that the brains of cocaine patients are structurally dissimilar from those of nondrug-using controls.  both cocaine treatment regimens significantly increased mor protein levels and protein stability, but only multiple intermittent treatments increased mor mrna levels as well as c-fos mrna levels and activator protein 1 binding activity.  (+)-cocaine, although not the naturally occurring stereoisomer, was 10-20-fold more potent than (-)-cocaine in competing for binding to the primary muscarinic recognition site.  the remarkable difference in the catalytic activity between mcoch and hcoch is consistent with the difference between the enzyme-(-)-cocaine binding modes obtained from molecular modelling.  here we show that brain-derived neurotrophic factor (bdnf) signaling through tyrosine kinase b (trkb) receptors in nacsh neurons is necessary for cocaine-induced dendritic spine formation by using either localized trkb knockout or viral-mediated expression of a dominant negative, kinase-dead trkb mutant.  srif neurons were more susceptible than npy neurons to the effects of cocaine.  given the important role of d1-msns in brain reward function, the present findings provide new insight into mechanisms by which brain cb2rs modulate cocaine action.  together, these findings indicate that bdnf-trkb signaling both mediates and reverses cocaine-induced increases in dendritic spine density in nacsh neurons, and these morphological changes are entirely dissociable from changes in addictive behavior.  according to the kinetic data, the catalytic efficiency (k(cat)/k(m)) of mbche against (-)-cocaine is comparable with that of hbche, but the catalytic efficiency of mcoch against (-)-cocaine is remarkably lower than that of hcoch by ~250-fold.  loss of trkb function after cocaine self-administration, however, leaves spine density intact but markedly enhances the motivation for cocaine, an effect mediated by specific loss of trkb signaling through phospholipase cgamma1 (plcγ1).  naturally occurring (-)-cocaine, in comparison with the corresponding human bche (hbche) and an hbche-based cocaine hydrolase (hcoch, i.e.  cocaine dependence is associated with abnormalities in brain structure in humans.  these data suggest that the high-affinity binding sites for cocaine and imipramine in the cerebral cortex are distinct entities.  results showed an enhanced rsfc within the sensory motor cortex and the left frontal-parietal network in cocaine users than controls.  structural deficiencies within limbic and prefrontal regions may contribute to the characteristic drug-seeking and drug-taking behaviors that prevail in persons dependent on cocaine.  cocaine was not selective for muscarinic receptor subtypes.  cocaine exposure has been reported to alter central μ-opioid receptor (mor) expression in vivo.  based on these novel findings, it is hypothesized that epigenetic mechanisms are implicated in cocaine's action on mor expression in neurons.  however, it is unclear whether these differences in brain structure predispose an individual to drug use or are a result of cocaine's action on the brain.  this study investigates the impact of chronic cocaine exposure on brain structure and drug-related behavior in mice. ||| ",Yes
Is there a relationship between B cells and Multiple Sclerosis?,Yes,"The evidence indicates that B cells play a significant role in the pathogenesis of Multiple Sclerosis (MS). B cells contribute to MS through various mechanisms, including antibody production, antigen presentation to T cells, and cytokine/chemokine production. The role of B cells in MS is further supported by the observation of significant overlaps between peripheral lymphoid and clonally expanded central nervous system (CNS) B cell populations in MS patients, suggesting that B cell trafficking may be critical in driving MS exacerbations. However, the precise roles and specific contributions of distinct B cell subsets in MS pathogenesis remain to be fully elucidated.","accumulating evidence supports a major role of b cells in multiple sclerosis (ms) pathogenesis.  increasing evidence suggests that b cells contribute both to the regulation of normal autoimmunity and to the pathogenesis of immune mediated diseases, including multiple sclerosis (ms).  b cells are one of the key players in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis (ms).  increasing evidence indicates the involvement of b cells in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis (ms), but their precise roles are unclear.  b cells play a central role in multiple sclerosis (ms) pathology.  there is ongoing debate on how b cells contribute to the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis (ms).  the role of b cells in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis (ms), an autoimmune neurodegenerative disease, is becoming eminent in recent years, but the specific contribution of the distinct b cell subsets remains to be elucidated.  b lymphocytes are thought to play a relevant role in multiple sclerosis (ms) pathology.  these results suggest that b cells play a role in ms independent from antibody production and possibly related to their role in antigen presentation to t cells or to their chemokine/cytokine production.  b lymphocytes contribute to the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis (ms) by secreting antibodies and producing cytokines.  b cells are key contributors to chronic autoimmune pathology in multiple sclerosis (ms).  b cells are important pathogenic players in multiple sclerosis (ms), but their exact role is not known.  the critical question is how b cells contribute to ms.  recent reports advocate greater involvement of b cells and immunoglobulins in the initiation and propagation of ms lesions at different stages of their ontogeny.  the role of b cells in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis (ms) is incompletely understood.  molecular analyses of b cell populations in ms patients have revealed significant overlaps between peripheral lymphoid and clonally expanded central nervous system (cns) b cell populations, indicating that b cell trafficking may play a critical role in driving ms exacerbations.  b lymphocytes participate to the pathogenesis of ms via the secretion of functionally-diverse cytokines that might play a role in determining disease phenotypes.  the contribution of b cells and their products to the pathogenesis of ms has long been debated.  in this paper, we discuss both the deleterious and the beneficial roles of b cells and immunoglobulins in ms lesions.  it is debated whether multiple sclerosis (ms) might result from an immunopathological response toward an active epstein-barr virus (ebv) infection brought into the central nervous system (cns) by immigrating b cells. ||| ",Yes
Is vemurafenib used for thyroid cancer?,Yes,"Vemurafenib, a selective BRAF inhibitor, has shown promising clinical activity in patients with papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) harboring the BRAF(V600E) mutation. It has been observed to induce partial responses and stable disease in patients with PTC that has become refractory to radioactive iodine. However, vemurafenib often displays limited efficacy in poorly differentiated and anaplastic thyroid carcinomas, possibly due to intrinsic and/or acquired resistance mechanisms. Despite this, vemurafenib is considered a potentially effective and well-tolerated treatment strategy in patients with advanced PTC harboring the BRAF(V600E) mutation.","vemurafenib, a selective braf inhibitor, appears to have promising clinical activity in patients with papillary thyroid cancer (ptc) harboring the braf(v600e) mutation.  vandetanib is an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor approved for treatment of advanced symptomatic or progressive medullary thyroid cancer (mtc).  vandetanib is the most widely used tyrosine kinase inhibitor for the treatment of patients with advanced medullary thyroid cancer (mtc).  a new study shows that the braf inhibitor vemurafenib may induce partial responses and stable disease in patients with papillary thyroid cancer that has become refractory to radioactive iodine.  unfortunately, vemurafenib often displays limited efficacy in poorly differentiated and anaplastic thyroid carcinomas probably because of intrinsic and/or acquired resistance mechanisms.  the tyrosine kinase inhibitors (tki) vandetanib and cabozantinib are approved as targeted therapies in advanced medullary thyroid carcinoma (mtc) with symptoms or high tumour burden.  this phase 2 study investigated the efficacy and safety of dovitinib (tki258), a receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor with potent activity against fibroblast growth factor receptor (fgfr) and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (vegfr), in locally advanced or metastatic thyroid cancer patients.  vandetanib was recently approved for the treatment of medullary thyroid cancer.  our data demonstrate that vemurafenib induces er stress response-mediated autophagy in thyroid cancer and autophagy inhibition may be a beneficial strategy to sensitize braf-mutant thyroid cancer to vemurafenib.  vandetanib is the first targeted drug to show evidence of efficacy in a randomised phase 2 trial in patients with locally advanced or metastatic differentiated thyroid carcinoma.  indeed, vemurafenib did not inhibit cell proliferation of braf v600e thyroid cscs, but rather stimulated cell proliferation along with a paradoxical over-activation of erk and akt pathways.  vemurafenib induced a high level of autophagy in braf-mutant thyroid cancer cells.  two tyrosine kinase inhibitors (tkis), vandetanib and cabozantinib, have been approved for recurrent/metastatic (r/m) medullary thyroid carcinoma (mtc).  dovitinib has a modest activity with manageable toxicity in locally advanced or metastatic thyroid cancer.  vemurafenib is a potentially effective and well-tolerated treatment strategy in patients with advanced ptc harboring the braf(v600e) mutation.  the brafv600e inhibitor vemurafenib is widely used to treat melanomas harboring the activated brafv600e mutation; however, vemurafenib showed poor efficacy in colon cancer, which impeded its clinical application for colon cancer patients with this mutation.  however, braf-mutant thyroid cancer is relatively resistant to vemurafenib, and the reason for this disparity remains unclear.  vemurafenib is a selective and potent small molecule inhibitor of the v600 mutant form of the braf protein used in the treatment of melanoma and colorectal cancer.  these findings highlight that hmgb1-mediated autophagy may account for vemurafenib resistance in thyroid cancer harboring braf mutation, implying a promising approach to overcome vemurafenib resistance in vemurafenib-mutant thyroid carcinomas.  vemurafenib, an inhibitor of mutated b-rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma, is frequently used in the treatment of melanoma and erdheim-chester disease (ecd) patients. ||| ",Yes
Is amoxicillin used for treatment of malnutrition in children?,Yes,"Explanation: Current World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines recommend the use of oral amoxicillin for children with uncomplicated malnutrition. This recommendation is based on the high risk of infectious mortality among children with severe acute malnutrition (SAM). Amoxicillin is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that is commonly used for the treatment of upper respiratory tract infections and acute otitis media in children. It is also classified as a first-line drug against Helicobacter pylori gastric infections. Despite concerns about increasing antibiotic resistance, current evidence supports the continued use of oral amoxicillin for treating children with uncomplicated SAM as outpatients.","current who guidelines recommend oral amoxicillin for children with uncomplicated malnutrition and parenteral benzylpenicillin and gentamicin for those with complicated malnutrition.  given the high risk of infectious mortality among children with severe acute malnutrition (sam), the world health organization recommends routine administration of a broad-spectrum antibiotic like amoxicillin as part of the management of uncomplicated sam.  routine amoxicillin for children with uncomplicated severe acute malnutrition raises concerns of increasing antibiotic resistance.  children with severe acute malnutrition (sam) are treated with empiric amoxicillin or penicillin and gentamicin because of the high risk of severe infections.  antibiotics are recommended by the who as part of the management of uncomplicated severe acute malnutrition in children.  we evaluated whether azithromycin, an antibiotic with antimalarial properties, improved malarial parasitemia outcomes in children with severe acute malnutrition compared with amoxicillin, an antibiotic commonly used for severe acute malnutrition that does not have antimalarial properties.  amoxicillin is one of the most used antibiotics among pediatric patients for the treatment of upper respiratory tract infections and specially for acute otitis media (aom), a common diseases of infants and childhood.  amoxicillin is a beta-lactam antibiotic largely used in childhood.  amoxicillin is the most common antibiotic prescribed in children with increasing use over time.  we performed an ancillary study nested within a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in niger testing the role of routine 7 day amoxicillin therapy in nutritional recovery of children 6 to 59 months of age with uncomplicated severe acute malnutrition.  infants and young children with severe acute malnutrition (sam) are treated with empiric broad-spectrum antimicrobials.  an oral ciprofloxacin dose of 10 mg/kg three times daily (30 mg/kg/day) may be a suitable alternative antibiotic for the management of sepsis in severely malnourished children.  amoxicillin is a worldwide used antibiotic, and it is classified as a first-line drug against helicobacter pylori gastric infections.  however, evidence for the efficacy of amoxicillin to improve nutritional recovery or reduce mortality has been mixed.  amoxicillin, used to treat a number of infections and listed by the who as an essential medicine, presented as a good drug candidate for this study.  ciprofloxacin (10 mg/kg, 12 hourly) was administered either 2 h before or up to 2 h after feeds to kenyan children hospitalized with severe malnutrition.  oral ciprofloxacin is a potential alternative to the standard parenteral ampicillin/gentamicin combination, but its pharmacokinetics in malnourished children is unknown.  conclusion current evidence supports the continued use of broad-spectrum oral amoxicillin for treating children with uncomplicated sam as outpatients.  although azithromycin may have advantages over amoxicillin in terms of dosing and administration for uncomplicated severe acute malnutrition, it may not yield additional benefit for malaria outcomes.  amoxicillin continues to be the drug of first choice in the treatment of acute otitis media in children, because it is generally considered to be the safest and least expensive of the available choices. ||| ",Yes
Does Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) show a bias for highly expressed loci?,No,"Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) is a technique that allows for the enrichment of genomic regions associated with specific transcription factors, histone modifications, and other epitopes present on chromatin. However, the technique itself does not inherently show a bias for highly expressed loci.

Is enzastaurin effective treatment of glioblastoma?,No,"Enzastaurin has been shown to have anti-glioma activity in patients with recurrent high-grade glioma, but it does not appear to have enough single-agent activity to be useful as monotherapy. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that enzastaurin, a potent inhibitor of protein kinase C-beta, inhibits angiogenesis and has direct cytotoxic activity against glioma cells. However, the median effective concentrations of enzastaurin were found to be at the upper limits of, or above, the clinically achievable range in all cell lines tested. Therefore, enzastaurin alone may not be an effective treatment for glioblastoma. However, the efficacy of enzastaurin can be potentiated by the addition of other molecularly targeted therapies, indicating that combining therapies may provide a more effective strategy than single-agent therapy to treat patients with malignant gliomas.","enzastaurin has anti-glioma activity in patients with recurrent high-grade glioma, but does not appear to have enough single-agent activity to be useful as monotherapy.  the initial objective of this study was to assess the efficacy of enzastaurin in a series of malignant human glioma cell lines with diverse genomic alterations.  enzastaurin, a potent inhibitor of protein kinase c-beta, inhibits angiogenesis and has direct cytotoxic activity against glioma cells in preclinical studies.  although enzastaurin independently produced a dose-dependent inhibition of cellular proliferation and decreased cell viability in each of the glioma cell lines examined, and partially down-regulated akt and gsk3beta phosphorylation, median effective concentrations were at the upper limits of, or above, the clinically achievable range in all cell lines tested.  enzastaurin is emerging as a promising new antitumor treatment.  several preliminary studies showed promising results in patients with various advanced cancers and suggested that enzastaurin can be safely used long term in combination with traditional chemotherapies.  enzastaurin - a novel oral antitumor agent that selectively inhibits protein kinase cbeta activity - has demonstrated promise in phase i and ii trials in various advanced cancers, and is being investigated in multiple hematologic malignancies and solid tumors.  enzastaurin (ly317615.hci), a protein kinase c (pkc)-beta inhibitor, has a radiosensitising effect on 4t1 murine breast cancer and human glioma cells; however, the exact mechanism of this action has not been evaluated.  taken together, these findings suggest that the efficacy of enzastaurin can be potentiated by the addition of 17-aag, and indicate that combining molecularly targeted therapies may provide a more effective strategy than single-agent therapy to treat patients with malignant gliomas.  enzastaurin (ly317615) was initially developed as an antiangiogenic cancer therapy.  remarkably, these results were confirmed in vivo, where enzastaurin showed antitumour activity and cooperativity with gefitinib in mice grafted with geo and geo-gr tumours, incrementing their median survival and inhibiting the aforesaid protein expression and secretion in tumour specimens.  we analysed the anti-tumour effects of enzastaurin in 22 lung cancer cell lines to ascertain the potential for enzastaurin-based treatment of lung cancer.  enzastaurin (ly317615.hcl) is an oral selective pkc-beta inhibitor with antiproliferative efficacy in various tumor models.  in conclusion, enzastaurin by interfering with signalling proteins implicated in egfr drug resistance markedly cooperates with gefitinib in sensitive and gefitinib-resistant tumours, thus overcoming and reverting such resistance and providing a rational basis for its development in patients resistant to anti-egfr drugs.  enzastaurin was evaluated alone and in combination with the egfr inhibitor gefitinib, on growth and signalling protein expression in human cancer cells sensitive and resistant to anti-egfr drugs, both in vitro and in nude mice.  enzastaurin showed preclinical antitumor activity against human tcc and enhanced the activity of gemcitabine.  enzastaurin displays pro-apoptotic properties against a spectrum of malignancies and is currently being investigated in clinical trials.  this review addresses the mechanism of action, development, preclinical studies, and clinical study results with enzastaurin.  enzastaurin induced significant apoptosis and inhibited proliferation in vitro at low micromolar concentrations.  enzastaurin alone presented not active in renal cell carcinoma cell lines. ||| ",No
Are genes symmetrically distributed between leading and lagging DNA strand in bacteria?,No,"The distribution of genes on the leading and lagging strands of the replication fork in bacteria is known to be biased. The nucleotide compositions of most bacteria differ between the leading and lagging DNA strands, with a strong bias for genes to be encoded on the leading strand. This phenomenon is attributed to collisions between the DNA and RNA polymerases. Strand biases are widespread in bacterial genomes, and the asymmetrical replication forks could have a major role in defining and constraining the structure of the bacterial chromosome. The results of a study in C. acetobutylicum indicate that there is little asymmetry between the two replication strands on open reading frame number and gene length, whereas the other three features presented significant strand bias. The analysis of 211 prokaryotic genomes found that SGD correlates not only with PolC, but also with purine asymmetry (PAS). The results demonstrated the continuous influence of essentiality on orientation bias and provided details on this visible structural feature of bacterial genomes.","many bacterial chromosomes display nucleotide asymmetry, or skew, between the leading and lagging strands of replication.  among prokaryotic genomes, the distribution of genes on the leading and lagging strands of the replication fork is known to be biased.  the nucleotide compositions of most bacteria differ between the leading and lagging dna strands.  in many bacteria, there is a strong bias for genes to be encoded on the leading strand of dna, resulting in coorientation of replication and transcription.  while all bacteria have a preference for gs over cs on the leading strand, we discover that the direction of the a/t skew is determined by the polymerase-alpha subunit that replicates the leading strand.  studies had found that bacterial genes are preferentially located on the leading strands.  in bacteria, most genes are on the leading strand of replication, a phenomenon attributed to collisions between the dna and rna polymerases.  it has been suggested that in bacteria such as bacillus subtilis, polc is responsible for the synthesis of the leading strand and dnae for the lagging strand, whereas in many other bacteria dnae is responsible for the synthesis of both strands.  strand biases are widespread in bacterial genomes.  this suggests that asymmetrical replication forks could have a major role in defining and constraining the structure of the bacterial chromosome.  bacterial genetic information is generally carried on a circular chromosome with a single origin of replication from which two replication forks proceed bidirectionally toward the opposite terminus region.  it is hoped that this review will improve the understanding of the extent and reasons for various types of strand bias in bacterial genomes.  we describe a model to quantify the contribution of mutational differences between the leading and lagging strands in producing replication-induced skew.  such a pattern could also arise from selection coupled with a bias for genes coded on the leading strand.  our results in c. acetobutylicum indicate that there is little asymmetry between 2 replication strands on open reading frame number and gene length, whereas the other 3 features presented significant strand bias.  in this work we have analyzed 211 prokaryotic genomes in terms of compositional strand asymmetries and the presence or absence of polc and have found that sgd correlates not only with polc, but also with purine asymmetry (pas).  as in eukaryotes, bacterial genomes are not randomly folded.  in this review, we discuss 5 types of bias, including gene orientation, the number of open reading frames, nucleotide composition, substitution rate, and gene length, between leading and lagging strands during replication.  the results demonstrated the continuous influence of essentiality on orientation bias and provided details on this visible structural feature of bacterial genomes.  and many experiences prove that the genes between leading strand and lagging strand is distinctly in copy, transcription and repair. ||| ",No
Can a given genotype exhibit opposite fitness effects (beneficial and detrimental) within the same environment?,Yes,"It is possible for a given genotype to exhibit opposite fitness effects within the same environment due to the phenomenon of antagonistic pleiotropy. This occurs when a single allele has opposing effects on different fitness components or traits. For instance, a mutation may enhance one trait, leading to a beneficial effect, while simultaneously impairing another trait, resulting in a detrimental effect. The net fitness outcome of such a mutation would depend on the balance between these opposing effects. This phenomenon can maintain genetic variation in populations and may have implications for the evolution of complex traits and life-history strategies.","however, alleles affecting traits like sex, evolvability, and cooperation can cause fitness effects that depend heavily on differences in the environmental, social, and genetic context of individuals carrying the allele.  such trait-specific dominance has been studied previously in models for the maintenance of genetic variation by antagonistic effects of an allele on two fitness components.  the effects of mutation and demography may generate population differences in overall levels of antagonistic fitness variation, as well as molecular population genetic signatures of balancing selection.  understanding how interactions among deleterious mutations affect fitness may shed light on a variety of fundamental biological phenomena, including the evolution of sex, the buffering of genetic variations, and the topography of fitness landscapes.  in this study it is hypothesized that modulation of different traits would have contrasting relevance for the fitness of populations of diverse origins.  if a mutation has opposite effects on fitness when expressed in different contexts, then genetic conflict arises.  mutations beneficial in one environment may cause costs in different environments, resulting in antagonistic pleiotropy.  it is concluded that modulation of a functional trait can be relevant to fitness in a given population (i.e.  tradeoffs in performance or fitness across environments have important implications regarding the nature of evolutionary constraints.  yet selection acts on phenotypes, not additive genetic variance alone, meaning that persistence and evolutionary potential in the near term, at least, may be influenced by other sources of fitness variation, including nonadditive genetic and maternal environmental effects.  because the phenotypic optima of males and females often differ, the fitness consequences of newly arisen alleles might not be concordant between the sexes and can be sexually antagonistic--genetic variants favored in one sex are deleterious in the other.  environmental features can alter the behaviors and phenotypes of organisms, influencing the dynamics of natural and sexual selection.  by generalizing these models to an arbitrary number of fitness components or other phenotypic traits with different degrees of dominance, i show that genetic polymorphism is generally impossible without antagonistic fitness effects of different traits and without trait-specific dominance.  nonadditivity in fitness effects from two or more mutations, termed epistasis, can result in compensation of deleterious mutations or negation of beneficial mutations.  depending on the genetic architecture of male and female fitness, sex-specific selection can have negative, positive, or neutral consequences for the opposite sex.  we found that mildly deleterious mutations interacted synergistically in poor-resource environments but antagonistically in rich-resource environments.  however, if such long-term genetic constraints do exist, they must be due to underlying pleiotropy such that alleles that confer high performance in one environment invariably confer low performance in another.  antagonistic selection--where alleles at a locus have opposing effects on male and female fitness (""sexual antagonism"") or between components of fitness (""antagonistic pleiotropy"")--might play an important role in maintaining population genetic variation and in driving phylogenetic and genomic patterns of sexual dimorphism and life-history evolution.  one genotype develops rapidly and has superior viability but reduced fertility relative to the alternative genotype.  experimental environmental manipulation, particularly when conducted in experiments where the dynamics of the purging of deleterious alleles are compared, has demonstrated both direct and indirect effects on the strength and direction of selection. ||| ",Yes
Are shadow enhancers associated with development?,Yes,"Justification: Shadow enhancers are associated with development as they play a critical role in controlling the expression of many developmental genes in both invertebrates and vertebrates, including mammals. These seemingly redundant transcriptional cis-regulatory elements regulate the same gene and drive overlapping expression patterns. They are found to be abundant and evolutionarily conserved, underscoring their key role in emerging metazoan gene regulatory networks. Shadow enhancers help foster robustness in gene expression in response to environmental or genetic perturbations, and they might provide an important mechanism for buffering gene expression against mutations in non-coding regulatory regions of genes implicated in human disease. They can interact in complex ways and may also help to drive the formation of transcriptional hubs within the nucleus. Technological advances have shed light on how shadow enhancers establish precise gene expression patterns and confer phenotypic robustness.","many developmental genes are controlled by shadow enhancers—pairs of enhancers that drive overlapping expression patterns.  recent studies have shown that shadow enhancers are remarkably abundant and control most developmental gene expression in both invertebrates and vertebrates, including mammals.  shadow enhancers, groups of seemingly redundant enhancers, are found in a wide range of organisms and are critical for robust developmental patterning.  it was suggested that shadow enhancers help foster robustness in gene expression in response to environmental or genetic perturbations .  these results support the hypothesis that compensatory evolution can occur between shadow enhancers, which has implications for mechanistic and evolutionary studies of gene regulation.  these results suggest that shadow enhancers represent a novel mechanism of canalization whereby complex developmental processes ""bring about one definite end-result regardless of minor variations in conditions"" .  using sequence analysis and experimental perturbation, we show that each shadow enhancer is regulated by different transcription factors.  shadow enhancers are seemingly redundant transcriptional cis-regulatory elements that regulate the same gene and drive overlapping expression patterns.  shadow enhancers can interact in complex ways and may also help to drive the formation of transcriptional hubs within the nucleus.  critical developmental control genes sometimes contain ""shadow"" enhancers that can be located in remote positions, including the introns of neighboring genes .  shadow enhancers might provide an important mechanism for buffering gene expression against mutations in non-coding regulatory regions of genes implicated in human disease.  despite their apparent redundancy, the prevalence and evolutionary conservation of shadow enhancers underscore their key role in emerging metazoan gene regulatory networks.  our results suggest the widespread use of shadow enhancers is partially due to their noise suppressing ability.  technological advances in genome editing and live imaging have shed light on how shadow enhancers establish precise gene expression patterns and confer phenotypic robustness.  evidence is presented that the snail gene is regulated by a distal shadow enhancer located within a neighboring locus.  we hypothesized that shadow enhancers drive consistent expression levels by buffering upstream noise through a separation of transcription factor (tf) inputs at the individual enhancers.  we hypothesized that compensatory evolution can maintain the total expression of a gene, while individual shadow enhancers diverge between species.  by measuring the transcriptional dynamics of several kruppel shadow enhancer configurations in live drosophila embryos, we showed that individual member enhancers act largely independently.  to test this hypothesis, we analyzed expression driven by orthologous pairs of shadow enhancers from drosophila melanogaster, drosophila yakuba, and drosophila pseudoobscura that control expression of krüppel, a transcription factor that patterns the anterior-posterior axis of blastoderm embryos.  both shadows and objects significantly influenced the perceived trajectory of the target, though the influence of the shadow was overall stronger. ||| ",Yes
Is there any cross-talk between the Wnt and the Akt pathways?,Yes,"The Wnt and Akt signaling pathways have been shown to interact in various contexts. For instance, the dopamine D2 receptor (D2DR) regulates Akt and may also target the Wnt pathway, both of which inhibit glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3). Additionally, Wnt5a and YAP expression are significantly correlated in specific cancer types, suggesting a more intricate crosstalk between YAP/TAZ and the Wnt pathway than previously thought. The Wnt pathway itself is known to activate at least two signaling pathways, the β-catenin-dependent and -independent pathways, and can be triggered by Wnt ligands to activate a variety of intracellular signaling cascades. The specific mechanisms of crosstalk between the Wnt and Akt pathways are still being elucidated, but evidence suggests that they do indeed interact and play a role in various cellular processes.","wnts activate at least two signaling pathways, the β-catenin-dependent and -independent pathways.  to our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating a direct cross-talk between akt and src in endothelial-barrier regulation.  abnormal wnt signaling is often observed in human cancers.  wnt ligands trigger the activation of a variety of β-catenin-dependent and β-catenin-independent intracellular signaling cascades.  multiple signaling pathways, including wnt signaling, participate in animal development, stem cell biology, and human cancer.  we focused on the roles of wnt4, wnt5a and wnt6, which are thought to be part of the non-canonical wnt pathway.  wnt5a regulates multiple intracellular signalling cascades, but how wnt5a determines the specificity of these pathways is not well understood.  alterations in the wnt signaling pathway have been implicated in alzheimer's disease; however, its role in the processing of the amyloid precursor protein remains unknown.  wnt5a is a representative wnt ligand that can activate both β-catenin-dependent canonical and β-catenin-independent noncanonical wnt pathways.  this study examined whether the internalization of wnt receptors affects the ability of wnt5a to regulate its signalling pathways.  these results suggest that wnt5a regulates distinct pathways through receptor internalization-dependent and -independent mechanisms.  to date, most data regarding the crosstalk between the wnt signaling pathway and the yap/taz transcriptional coactivators focuses on the wnt/β-catenin branch of the pathway.  our data demonstrate that in human bbb cells the expression of pgp is controlled by a cross-talk between canonical and non-canonical wnt pathways.  the dopamine d2 receptor (d2dr) regulates akt and may also target the wnt pathway, two signalling cascades that inhibit glycogen synthase kinase-3 (gsk-3).  moreover, wnt5a and yap expression are significantly correlated in specific cancer types, suggesting that the crosstalk between yap/taz and the wnt pathway is more intricate than previously thought.  to investigate the expression of wnt and tgf-β signaling and the crosstalk between these 2 signaling pathways in aga.  these results suggest that the noncanonical wnt pathway might be critically important in gastric carcinogenesis.  despite the variations in intracellular signaling, wnt pathways share the effector proteins frizzled, dishevelled, and β-arrestin.  recent experiments have explored effects of activities of kinases other than the well-studied gsk3beta, in wnt pathway signaling, particularly at the level of beta-catenin.  recent studies suggest that ift-a proteins and kinesin-2 modulate canonical wnt/wg-signalling independently of their ciliary role. ||| ",Yes
Does cortical spreading depression appear in ischemic penumbra following ischemic stroke?,Yes,"Cortical spreading depression (CSD) has been observed in the penumbral zone of the brain in rats with focal cerebral ischemia. This phenomenon has been shown to promote the expansion of infarction and worsen penumbra conditions in cortical border zones of experimental focal ischemia. Furthermore, CSD and peri-infarct depolarization (PID) have been shown to cause secondary neuronal damage and infarct expansion in various experimental models of stroke. The existence of subcortical zones of ischemic penumbra has also been demonstrated, with transient peri-infarct depolarizations emerging not only in cortical but also in striatal gray matter. These findings suggest that CSD is likely to occur in boundary zones in the ischemic human cerebral cortex.","spontaneous cortical spreading depression (csd) has been found to occur in the penumbral zone of the brain in rats with focal cerebral ischemia, and has been shown to promote expansion of infarction.  spreading depression-like peri-infarct depolarizations not only characterize but also worsen penumbra conditions in cortical border zones of experimental focal ischemia.  recent studies have shown that the brain ischemic area defined by the map of decreased apparent diffusion coefficient (adc) obtained by diffusion-weighted imaging (dwi) during the first hours of ischemic stroke includes a significant part of ischemic penumbra.  we conclude that in focal ischemia, transient peri-infarct depolarizations emerge not only in cortical but also in striatal gray matter, thereby demonstrating the existence of subcortical zones of ischemic penumbra.  whether lowered apparent diffusion coefficient (adc) values were present in the ischemic penumbra of patients presenting with acute ischemic stroke and were specific to regions of the penumbra that proceeded to infarction was investigated.  cortical spreading depression promotes lesion progression in experimental stroke, and may contribute to the initiation of migraine attacks.  cortical spreading depression (csd) has been observed during the early phase of subarachnoid hemorrhage (sah).  cortical spreading depression (csd) and periinfarct depolarization (pid) have been shown in various experimental models of stroke to cause secondary neuronal damage and infarct expansion.  to determine the relationship between early onset poststroke depression and ischemic stroke lesion location.  depression of electrocorticogram propagating over the cortex surface results in cortical spreading depression (csd), which is probably related to the pathophysiology of stroke, epilepsy, and migraine.  cortical spreading depression (csd) occurrence has been suggested to be associated with seizures, migraine aura, head injury and brain ischemia-infarction.  cortical tissue surrounding acute ischemic infarcts undergoes repetitive spontaneous depolarizations.  nineteen patients with hemispheric stroke of less than 6 hours' onset and with acute scans showing a perfusion lesion greater than a diffusion lesion (ischemic penumbra) were studied.  the concept of ""cortical spreading depression"" following subarachnoid hemorrhage (sah) drastically tends to change the direction of vasospasm research.  prediction of the regions of the ischemic penumbra that are likely to progress to infarction is of great clinical interest.  acute psychosis or other neuropsychiatric symptoms including depression may present in stroke patients and patients with lesions either within the prefrontal or occipital cortices, or in subcortical areas such as the basal ganglia, thalamus, mid-brain, and brainstem.  cortical spreading depression (csd) has been much studied experimentally but never demonstrated unequivocally in human neocortex by direct electrophysiological recording.  the relationship between poststroke depression and ischemic stroke lesion location is controversial.  cortical spreading depolarization (csd), cortical spreading ischemia (csi), and early brain injury are involved in the occurrence of delayed brain ischemia after subarachnoid hemorrhage (sah).  on the basis of these observations, we suggest that the related phenomenon, peri-infarct depolarization, is indeed likely to occur in boundary zones in the ischemic human cerebral cortex. ||| ",Yes
Is there a difference in the rate between gene fusion and gene fission?,Yes,"The rate of gene fusion and gene fission can vary due to their distinct mechanisms and evolutionary implications. Gene fusion involves the merging of two adjacent genes into a single gene, often resulting in a new protein with altered or novel functions. This process is facilitated by genomic rearrangements, such as deletions, amplifications, and translocations. In contrast, gene fission is the splitting of a single gene into two separate genes, which can lead to the diversification of gene functions.

     Recent comparative genome analyses have revealed several cases of fusion/fission events across diverse phylogenies. However, the rate of these events can differ due to their distinct evolutionary pressures and consequences. For instance, gene fusions are more likely to occur when the original genes are functionally linked, such as in the same metabolic pathway. In contrast, gene fission may be more prevalent in cases where the original gene has multiple functions that can be independently regulated or optimized.

     The occurrence of gene fusions and fissions can also be influenced by the organism's genomic architecture, such as the presence of mobile genetic elements, repetitive sequences, and chromosomal rearrangements. Therefore, the rate of gene fusion and fission can vary across different lineages and taxa, reflecting their unique evolutionary histories and selective pressures.","during the course of evolution genes undergo both fusion and fission by which orfs are joined or separated.  gene fission and fusion, the processes by which a single gene is split into two separate genes and two adjacent genes are fused into a single gene, respectively, are among the primary processes that generate new genes.  we have also examined the evolution of the gene fusion events identified, to determine whether they can be attributed to fusion or fission, by looking at the conservation of the fused genes and of the individual component genes across the major eukaryotic and prokaryotic lineages.  fusion genes, also known as ""chimeras"", are formed by the breakage and re-joining of two different chromosomes.  gene fusion is an important evolutionary process.  recent comparative genome analysis shows several cases of fusion/fission across distant phylogeny.  on many occasions, the evolutionary scenario also involves one or more secondary fissions of the fusion gene.  fusion genes result from genomic rearrangements, such as deletions, amplifications and translocations.  these data suggest that gene fission plays an important and hitherto underestimated role in gene evolution.  the occurrence of gene fusions suggests that the two original genes that participated in the fusion are functionally linked, i.e.  the process of gene fusion involves the formation of a single chimeric gene from multiple complete or partial gene sequences.  gene fusions have been studied extensively, as frequent drivers of tumorigenesis as well as potential therapeutic targets.  gene fusion is recognized as an important mechanism by which genes and their protein products can evolve new functions.  we name the products of such fusion events cross-strand chimeric rna (cscrna).  we find relatively limited occurrence of gene fusions/fissions within the protist lineages examined.  our results point to two trypanosome-specific gene fissions, which have recently been experimentally confirmed, one fusion involving proteins involved in the same metabolic pathway, as well as two novel putative functional links between fusion-linked protein pairs.  the evolutionary history of gene fusions was studied by phylogenetic analysis of the domains in the fused proteins and the orthologous domains that form stand-alone proteins.  the grouping into families will help distinguish sequencing or prediction errors from real biological fusions, and it will yield additional insight into the function and history of fused genes.  with the application of defined constraints, certain properties of the detected genes are evaluated to predict whether they may be fused.  gene fusions can be used as tools for functional prediction and also as evolutionary markers. ||| ",Yes

However, there is no mention of TIEG1 (TGF-β-inducible early growth response protein 1) in the context. Therefore, based on the given information, it cannot be confirmed that TIEG1 has been associated with apoptosis.","although the newly identified protein tumor necrosis factor α-induced protein 8-like 1 (tnfaip8l1), also known as tipe1, has been reported to be able to induce apoptosis in human hepatocellular carcinoma cells, the involvement of tipe1 in apoptosis remains to be elucidated.  these findings suggest that tl1 may act as an autocrine factor to induce apoptosis in endothelial cells via activation of multiple signaling pathways, including stress protein kinases as well as certain caspases.  although some studies have suggested that tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (trail) might be involved in atherosclerosis, its potential role in endothelial dysfunction and apoptosis has not been investigated.  the present study was undertaken to explore whether tl1 induces apoptosis in endothelial cells and, if so, to explore its mechanism of action.  tipe1 (tumor necrosis factor-α-induced protein 8-like 1 or tnfaip8l1) is a newly identified member of the tipe (tnfaip8) family, which play roles in regulating cell death.  these results indicated that tipe1 could promote the apoptosis of raw264.7 cells by upregulating the pro-apoptotic members of the bcl-2 family of proteins, and that the mapks signaling pathway was not involved in the pro-apoptotic effect of tipe1.  tipe1 (tumor necrosis factor-α-induced protein 8-like 1 or tnfaip8l1) belongs to the tipe (tnfaip8) family, which act as a regulator of cell death.  consequently, these data provide the first evidence that targeted silencing of tigar induces apoptotic and autophagic cell death in hepg2 cells, and our data raise hope for the future successful application of tigar sirna in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc).  surprisingly, tfeb promotes rather than inhibits apoptosis in response to 15d-pgj2.  tipe1 (tumor necrosis factor-α-induced protein 8-like 1) contributes to cell death in diverse cancers.  here we investigated the role of pctaire1 in apoptosis, especially in the extrinsic cell death pathway.  the cell apoptosis rate was detected by flow cytometry.  our findings revealed that tipe1 induced apoptosis in hcc cells by negatively regulating rac1 pathway, and loss of tipe1 might be a new prognostic indicator for hcc patients.  tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (trail) serves as an extracellular signal triggering apoptosis in tumor cells.  tipe2, also known as tnfaip8l2, a member of the tumor necrosis factor-alpha-induced protein-8 (tnfaip8) family, is known as an inhibitor in inflammation and cancer, and its overexpression induces cell death.  so far, the function of apoptosis mediated by tia-1 has been extensively studied in higher animals, and apoptosis happens to be related to biological immune defense.  we examined the role of tipe2 with respect to adjuvant arthritis (aa)-associated pathogenesis by analyzing the tipe2 regulation of death receptor (dr5)-mediated apoptosis in vitro.  this work not only evidences how tfeb is activated by 15d-pgj2, but also unveils a previously unexplored role of ros-dependent activation of tfeb in modulating cell apoptosis in response to 15d-pgj2.  it may be involved in the induction of apoptosis in target cells during lymphocyte attack.  taken together, our results suggest that oxidative stress mediates trail-induced apoptosis in hela cells. ||| ",Yes
Does CRISPR inversion of CTCF sites alter genome topology?,Yes,"The inversion of CTCF sites using CRISPR technology has been shown to reconfigure the topology of chromatin loops between distal enhancers and target promoters, thereby altering gene-expression patterns. This is due to the fact that the location and relative orientations of CTCF sites determine the specificity of long-range chromatin looping in mammalian genomes. Furthermore, the orientation of at least some enhancers carrying CTCF sites can determine both the architecture of topological chromatin domains and enhancer/promoter specificity.","inversion of cbs elements within the pcdh enhancer reconfigures the topology of chromatin loops between the distal enhancer and target promoters and alters gene-expression patterns.  recent studies identified a correlation between the orientation of ctcf-binding sites (cbss) and chromatin loops.  however, crispr rna is reported to bind to other genomic locations that differ from the intended target site by a few nucleotides, demonstrating significant off-target activity.  using crispr dna-fragment editing, in conjunction with chromosome conformation capture, we find that ctcf sites, if located between enhancers and promoters in the protocadherin (pcdh) and β-globin clusters, function as an enhancer-blocking insulator by forming distinct directional chromatin loops, regardless whether enhancers contain ctcf sites or not.  our analysis demonstrates the importance of structural rearrangements in mediating the effect of crispr-cas9-induced dna damage, with implications for the use of crispr-cas9 gene-editing in cancer cells.  structural rearrangements are a ubiquitous feature of cancer cells and their impact on the functional consequences of crispr-cas9 gene-editing has not yet been assessed.  utilizing crispr-cas9 knockout screens for 250 cancer cell lines, we demonstrate that targeting structurally rearranged regions, in particular tandem or interspersed amplifications, is highly detrimental to cellular fitness in a gene-independent manner.  to test the functional significance of this observation, we combined crispr/cas9-based genomic-dna-fragment editing with chromosome-conformation-capture experiments to show that the location and relative orientations of cbss determine the specificity of long-range chromatin looping in mammalian genomes, using protocadherin (pcdh) and β-globin as model genes.  the recently discovered clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (crispr)-cpf1 system expands the genome editing toolbox.  a recent publication in cell helps resolve this paradox by revealing crispr-array-independent mechanisms of chromosomal homing unique to different cast types.  crispr-dt will empower researchers in genome editing.  the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (crispr)-cpf1 system has been successfully applied in genome editing.  crispr-associated tn7 transposons (casts) co-opt cas genes for rna-guided transposition.  to carry out target site-specific genome editing, we released the crisprdirect ( http://crispr.dbcls.jp /) website.  furthermore, ctcf insulators promote, counter-intuitively, long-range chromatin interactions with distal directional ctcf sites, consistent with the cohesin ""loop extrusion"" model.  here, we exploited crispr interference and programmable base editing to determine their potential in editing a tert gene promoter-activating mutation, which occurs in many diverse cancer types, particularly glioblastoma5-8.  clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (crispr)-cas9 technology allows the modification of dna sequences in vivo at the location of interest.  thus, although enhancers can function in an orientation-independent manner in reporter assays, in the native chromosome context, the orientation of at least some enhancers carrying cbss can determine both the architecture of topological chromatin domains and enhancer/promoter specificity.  finally, gene expression levels are negatively correlated with ctcf insulators located between enhancers and promoters on a genome-wide scale.  in this study, we reanalyzed the published crispr-cpf1 grnas data and found many sequence and structural features related to their target efficiency. ||| ",Yes
Is Doxorubicin cardiotoxic?,Yes,"Doxorubicin, a widely used chemotherapeutic agent, is recognized to have cardiotoxic side effects. The cardiotoxicity of doxorubicin is a significant and dose-limiting clinical problem, and its mechanism remains incompletely understood. The drug produces severe side effects such as cardiotoxicity, which is mainly caused by its metabolite, doxorubicinol. The induction of death receptors in cardiomyocytes is likely a critical mechanism by which doxorubicin causes cardiotoxicity. Dexrazoxane is used to protect against doxorubicin cardiotoxicity.","doxorubicin is a highly effective anticancer agent but causes cardiotoxicity in many patients.  doxorubicin (dox) is one of the most effective antitumor drugs, but its cardiotoxicity has been a major concern for its use in cancer therapy for decades.  doxorubicin (dox) is one of the most effective chemotherapeutic drugs; however, its incidence of cardiotoxicity compromises its therapeutic index.  doxorubicin (dox) is a widely administered chemotherapeutic drug and incidences of cardiotoxicity associated with its administration have been of general concern.  doxorubicin (dox), a wide-spectrum chemotherapeutic agent, is recognized to have cardiotoxic side effects when it is applied in hematological diseases and solid tumor management.  doxorubicin  is an effective anticancer agent whose major limiting side effect is cardiotoxicity.  doxorubicin (dox) is an effective chemotherapeutic agent, however, its use is limited by cardiotoxicity.  cardiotoxicity is a treatment-limiting side effect of the anticancer drug doxorubicin (dox).  doxorubicin, a highly effective anticancer drug, produces severe side effect such as cardiotoxicity, which is mainly caused by its metabolite, doxorubicinol.  doxorubicin (dox) is an effective antineoplastic agent used to treat cancers, but its use is limited as dox induces adverse cardiotoxic effects.  doxorubicin (dox, an anthracycline) is a widely used chemotherapy agent against various forms of cancer; however, it is also known to induce dose-dependent cardiotoxicity leading to adverse complications.  doxorubicin (former generic name, adriamycin), a highly effective anticancer drug, produces cardiotoxicity, which limits its therapeutic potential.  our observation that doxorubicin was more potent than doxorubicinol in inhibiting tumor cell growth in vitro suggests that the cardiotoxicity of doxorubicin is dissociable from its anticancer activity.  doxorubicin is one of the most effective anticancer drug, but its usefulness is limited by the risk of developing cardiomyopathy, cardiac dysfunction and ventricular arrhythmias.  here, we review the correlation of cardiotoxicity of doxorubicinwith its peak plasma concentration and diffusion in the heart, followed by reductive bioactivation or oxidativeinactivation.  these data demonstrate that the induction of death receptors in cardiomyocytes is likely a critical mechanism by which doxorubicin causes cardiotoxicity.  selective cardiotoxicity of doxorubicin remains a significant and dose-limiting clinical problem.  however, the mechanism of doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity is unclear.  the mechanisms of doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity remain incompletely understood.  dexrazoxane is used to protect against doxorubicin cardiotoxicity. ||| ",Yes
Are microtubules marked by glutamylation?,Yes,"Microtubules are indeed marked by glutamylation, a posttranslational modification that is functionally important and enriched on stable microtubules. This modification is catalyzed by a family of tubulin tyrosine ligase-like (ttll) enzymes and is observed in all stages of the cell cycle, including interphase. The length of the glutamyl side chain is spatially controlled and microtubule type specific. Moreover, a cell cycle-dependent gradient of glutamylation has been observed along the cell anteroposterior axis. This modification is also involved in the regulation of centriole stability, neuronal outgrowth, and cilia motility.","we showed that microtubules are intensely glutamylated in all stages of the cell cycle, including interphase.  posttranslational glutamylation of tubulin is present on selected subsets of microtubules in cells.  microtubule glutamylation is an important modulator of microtubule function and has been implicated in the regulation of centriole stability, neuronal outgrowth and cilia motility.  glutamylation of the microtubules is catalyzed by a family of tubulin tyrosine ligase-like (ttll) enzymes.  here we demonstrate that glutamylation, and in particular the generation of long glutamate side chains, promotes the severing of microtubules.  the length of the glutamyl side chain is spatially controlled and microtubule type specific.  moreover, a cell cycle-dependent gradient of glutamylation was observed along the cell anteroposterior axis, which might be related to active growth of the microtubule 'corset' during the cell cycle.  glutamylation is a functionally important tubulin posttranslational modification enriched on stable microtubules of neuronal axons, mitotic spindles, centrioles, and cilia.  the diverse populations of microtubule polymers in cells are functionally distinguished by different posttranslational modifications, including polyglutamylation.  a set of glutamylases and deglutamylases controls levels of tubulin polyglutamylation, a prominent post-translational modification of neuronal microtubules.  strikingly, in the same cell, hyperelongation of glutamyl side chains stabilized cytoplasmic microtubules and destabilized axonemal microtubules.  microtubules can be deglutamylated by the cytosolic carboxypeptidase ccp1.  we have undertaken an analysis of the glutamylating ttll enzymes in c. elegans we find that although all five ttll enzymes are expressed in the embryo and adult worm, loss of individual enzymes does not perturb microtubule function in embryonic cell divisions.  polyglutamylation is enriched on subsets of microtubules including those found in the centrioles, mitotic spindle, and cilia.  microtubules (mts) play crucial roles during neuronal life.  tubulins, building blocks of microtubules, are modified substrates of diverse post-translational modifications including phosphorylation, polyglycylation and polyglutamylation.  we show that in cilia of tetrahymena, ttll6 e-ligases generate glutamylation mainly on the b-tubule of outer doublet microtubules, the site of force production by ciliary dynein.  posttranslational modifications (ptms) such as acetylation, detyrosination, and polyglutamylation have long been considered markers of stable microtubules and have recently been proposed to guide molecular motors to specific subcellular destinations.  glutamylation is a conserved tubulin modification  that is enriched in axonemes.  in vertebrates, balanced activities of tubulin glutamyl ligase and cytoplasmic carboxypeptidase deglutamylase enzymes maintain organelle- and cell type-specific tubulin glutamylation patterns. ||| ",Yes
Can administration of the thyrotropin releasing hormone reduce fatigue in cancer patients?,No,"The administration of thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH) has not been shown to reduce fatigue in cancer patients. The context provided discusses the use of TRH to evaluate the inhibition of thyrotropin (TSH) release in normal subjects and hypothyroid patients, but it does not provide evidence for the use of TRH to reduce fatigue in cancer patients. The context also discusses the use of thyroid hormone therapy in the management of thyroid cancer, but it does not mention the use of TRH for this purpose. The context does discuss the relationship between fatigue and the TSH receptor (TSHR)-Asp727Glu polymorphism, but it does not suggest that TRH can be used to reduce fatigue in cancer patients.","research on determinants of well-being in patients on thyroid hormone replacement therapy is warranted, as persistent fatigue-related complaints are common in this population.  inhibition of thyrotropin (tsh) release by chronic treatment with small quantities of triiodothyronine (t(3)) and thyroxine (t(4)) was evaluated by determining the serum tsh response to thyrotropin-releasing hormone (trh) in normal subjects and hypothyroid patients.  long-term thyroid hormone (th) therapy aiming at the suppression of serum thyrotropin (tsh) has been traditionally used in the management of well differentiated thyroid cancer (thyrca).  suppression of thyroid stimulating hormone (tsh) below the normal range with administration of l-thyroxine has been shown to improve survival in patients treated for thyroid cancer (tc).  it was recently demonstrated that treatment with levorotatory thyroxine (t4) plus triiodothyronine (t3) compared with treatment with t4 alone improves psychologic functioning in hypothyroid patients with thyroid cancer or autoimmune thyroiditis.  furthermore, the relationship between fatigue and the tsh receptor (tshr)-asp727glu polymorphism, a common genetic variant of the tshr, was analyzed.  suppression of thyrotropin (often referred to as thyroid-stimulating hormone, or tsh) with levothyroxine used in management of intermediate- and high-risk differentiated thyroid cancer (dtc) to reduce the likelihood of progression and death is based on conflicting evidence.  temporary thyroid hormone withdrawal has previously been used, but causes hypothyroidism and, rarely, tumor progression.  patients with thyroid cancer benefit from treatment with exogenous thyroid hormone for two reasons: it provides adequate levels of thyroid hormone to peripheral tissues, and it reduces the level of thyrotropin, which may be an important growth factor in patients with differentiated malignant neoplasms.  therefore, we evaluated quality of life in patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma (dtc) on tsh-suppressive thyroxine therapy as a model for subclinical hyperthyroidism and we investigated whether restoration to euthyroidism affects quality of life.  in this study, we evaluated the impact of different states of hypothyroidism on fatigue and fatigue-related symptoms.  to detect recurrent disease in patients who have had differentiated thyroid cancer, periodic withdrawal of thyroid hormone therapy may be required to raise serum thyrotropin concentrations to stimulate thyroid tissue so that radioiodine (iodine-131) scanning can be performed.  suppression therapy of thyreostimulin (tsh) using thyroid hormones improves survival of subjects operated for differentiated thyroid cancer.  thyrotropin stimulates radioiodine uptake for scanning in patients with thyroid cancer, but the sensitivity of scanning after the administration of thyrotropin is less than that after the withdrawal of thyroid hormone.  depressive symptomatology improved with thyroxine.  the mean serum total t4 and free t4 concentrations increased significantly in both groups after thyroxine therapy (p < 0.01), the serum total triiodothyronine (t3) level did not change (p > 0.05), and the serum thyrotropin level (tsh) and t3/t4 ratio decreased markedly (p < 0.01).  the elevation of thyroid-stimulating hormone, or thyrotropin (tsh), that occurs with hypothyroidism stimulates uptake of radioiodine in normal and cancerous thyroid tissues.  levothyroxine suppression of thyrotropin (tsh) is broadly applied to patients with thyroid cancer despite lack of consensus on the optimal tsh concentration necessary to reduce cancer recurrence while minimizing toxicity from subclinical hyperthyroidism.  aih patients had significantly higher levels of fatigue compared with dtc patients, which could not be attributed to clinical or thyroid hormone parameters.  the modest effect of the tshr-asp727glu polymorphism on fatigue was found in dtc patients only. ||| ",Yes
Do chromatin features predict genes associated with eQTLs?,Yes,"Chromatin features have been identified as critical predictors of variant regulatory potential when connected to expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) in a wide range of human tissues and cell types. These features provide insights into the regulatory mechanisms underlying disease risk and offer a possible mechanism by which genetic variants, often in non-coding regions, may influence observable phenotypes. Therefore, chromatin features can predict genes associated with eQTLs, contributing to the understanding of complex traits and the roles of trait-related eQTLs and their corresponding target genes in trait determination.","expression quantitative trait loci (eqtls) help to explain the regulatory mechanisms underlying these genetic associations.  the collection of expression quantitative trait loci (eqtls) is an important resource to study complex traits through understanding where and how transcriptional regulations are controlled by genetic variations in the non-coding regions of the genome.  expression quantitative trait loci (eqtls) are genetic variants that affect gene expression.  expression quantitative trait loci (eqtls) studies provide associations of genetic variants with gene expression but fall short of pinpointing functionally important eqtls.  expression quantitative trait loci (eqtl) can provide a link between disease susceptibility variants discovered by genetic association studies and biology.  by connecting large-scale epigenomic profiles to expression quantitative trait loci (eqtls) in a wide range of human tissues/cell types, we identify critical chromatin features that predict variant regulatory potential.  expression quantitative trait loci (eqtl) are genomic regions regulating rna transcript expression levels.  expression quantitative trait loci (eqtls) characterize the associations between genetic variation and gene expression to provide insights into tissue-specific gene regulation.  gene expression is influenced by variants commonly known as expression quantitative trait loci (eqtl).  although expression quantitative trait loci (eqtls) have been powerful in identifying susceptibility genes from genome-wide association study (gwas) findings, most trait-associated loci are not explained by eqtls alone.  expression quantitative trait locus (eqtl) analysis is a powerful tool to study the biological mechanisms linking the genotype with gene expression.  previous studies have focused on associating eqtls with traits to identify the roles of trait-related eqtls and their corresponding target genes involved in trait determination.  expression quantitative trait loci (eqtl), or genetic variants associated with changes in gene expression, have the potential to assist in interpreting results of genome-wide association studies (gwas).  conditioned on a tissue, expression quantitative trait loci (eqtls) are genetic variants associated with gene expression, and egenes are genes whose expression levels are associated with genetic variants.  in this article we present a method for functional eqtl discovery and provide insights into relevance of noncoding variants for cell-specific gene regulation and for disease association beyond conventional eqtl mapping.  these eqtls provide insights into regulatory mechanisms underlying disease risk.  genome-wide association studies (gwas) have identified many variants, often in non-coding regions, with unknown functions and eqtl provide a possible mechanism by which these variants may influence observable phenotypes.  however, most genes are influenced by multiple eqtls which, thus, jointly affect any downstream phenotype.  expression quantitative trait loci (eqtls) have been found to be enriched in trait-associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (snps).  this approach allowed us to identify functionally important eqtls and show mechanisms that explain their cell-type restriction. ||| ",Yes
Is fatigue prevalent in patients receiving treatment for glioblastoma?,Yes,"Fatigue is a frequently reported symptom in patients with glioblastoma, both at baseline and throughout the disease trajectory.

Furthermore, fatigue is a common symptom in patients with brain tumors, including long-term survivors of low-grade brain tumors. Therefore, it can be concluded that fatigue is prevalent in patients receiving treatment for glioblastoma.","our findings indicate that glioblastoma patients are frequently affected by fatigue at baseline, suggesting that factors other than those related to radio- or chemotherapy have significant impact, particularly depression and tumor localization.  fatigue is a consistently reported, severe symptom among patients with gliomas throughout the disease trajectory.  the aim of this study was to determine the prevalence and severity of fatigue in long-term survivors with a low-grade glioma (lgg), and to analyze the relationship between fatigue and demographic variables, disease duration, tumor characteristics, former tumor treatment modalities, antiepileptic drug (aed) use, self-reported concentration, motivation, and activity.  our findings indicate that fatigue is a common symptom in patients with diffuse glioma, both pre- and postoperatively.  the main goal of this study was to assess frequency, clinical correlates, and independent predictors of fatigue in a homogeneous cohort of well-defined glioblastoma patients at baseline prior to combined radio-chemotherapy.  fatigue is common among glioma patients undergoing radiotherapy (rt) and impacts quality of life (qol).  we prospectively included 65 glioblastoma patients at postsurgical baseline and assessed fatigue, sleepiness, mean bedtimes, mood disturbances, and clinical characteristics such as clinical performance status, presenting symptomatology, details on neurosurgical procedure, and tumor location and diameter as well as pharmacological treatment including antiepileptic drugs, antidepressants, and use of corticosteroids.  quality of life (qol) impairment and fatigue are frequently experienced during treatment for recurrent high-grade glioma (hgg).  the purpose of this study was to explore the prevalence of pre- and postoperative high fatigue, perioperative changes, and factors associated with pre- and postoperative high fatigue in patients undergoing primary surgery for diffuse glioma.  to evaluate changes in fatigue at the time of diagnosis (time 1) and two weeks after the completion of radiation therapy (time 2) and to determine the relationship between fatigue and quality of life (qol) at each time interval in patients with glioblastoma multiformae (gbm).  further studies are needed to determine whether pharmacologic treatment improves fatigue in glioma patients undergoing rt.  tiredness may be caused by the brain injury due to the tumor or the treatment in patients with glioblastoma multiforme (gbm).  to evaluate fatigue and cognitive functioning in patients with low-grade glioma and to assess whether cognitive functioning and employment status differ between patients with severe and non-severe mental fatigue.  only fatigue appeared to be more common in glioblastoma patients than in healthy controls (48% vs 11%; p < .001) but not the frequency of sleepiness (22% vs 19%; p = .43).  patients with low grade glioma show high rates of fatigue, especially in the mental domain, which might be associated with deficits in cognitive functioning and changes in employment status.implications for rehabilitationthe majority of patients with low grade glioma suffers from severe mental fatigue and has deficits in cognitive functioning, which may affect employment status.patients with low grade glioma should be screened for fatigue with the multidimensional fatigue inventory, to differentiate between mental and physical fatigue.patients with low grade glioma with severe mental fatigue should be screened for problems in cognitive functioning with an objective neuropsychological test battery.cognitive and vocational rehabilitation programs should aim at coping with severe mental fatigue and attention deficits in patients with low grade glioma.  fatigue is a common symptom in patients with brain tumors, but comprehensive studies on fatigue in patients with meningioma specifically are lacking.  in addition to neurologic symptoms, fatigue is commonly reported in patients with primary brain tumors during radiation therapy and in long-term survivors of low-grade brain tumors.  clinical factors (performance status, tumor details, age, gender) were collected by chart review on glioma patients with fatigue (""i have lack of energy"" on functional assessment of cancer therapy-brain), as well as available genotyping data.  cancer patients present a high degree of fatigue, which dramatically affects the quality of their everyday life.  fatigue is a common and distressing symptom in cancer patients which negatively affects patients' daily functioning and health-related quality of life. ||| ",Yes
Can GDF15 be a biomarker for metformin treatment?,Yes,"Justification: The context suggests that GDF15 levels are associated with metformin use, as evidenced by a 40% rise in GDF15 levels in participants with diabetes after metformin treatment. The relatively high bioavailability of GDF15 might partly explain the protective cardiovascular effects of metformin. Furthermore, the context reveals that noncoding variation within a metformin-activated enhancer may increase GDF15 expression and help predict GDF15 levels. These findings suggest that GDF15 can be a biomarker for metformin treatment.","aim: gdf15 levels are a biomarker for metformin use.  growth differentiation factor 15 (gdf-15), a suggested biomarker for metformin use, may explain the potential cardioprotective and anti-cancer properties of metformin.  in participants with diabetes, metformin treatment was associated with a 40% rise in gdf-15 level, which was independent of the other major factors, and largely explained their elevated gdf-15 levels.  the relatively high gdf-15 bioavailability might partly explain the protective cardiovascular effects of metformin.  to gain insight into the relationship of gdf-15 with metformin and major cardiovascular risk factors, we analysed the data from the summit cohort (n = 1438), a four-centre, nested, case-control study aimed at verifying whether biomarkers of atherosclerosis differ according to the presence of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease.  conclusion: noncoding variation within a metformin-activated enhancer may increase gdf15 expression and help to predict gdf15 levels.  our results contrast the bmi-lowering effects of an acute increase in gdf15 levels observed after metformin use.  results: the gwas lead snp rs888663, the snp rs62122429 associated with gdf15 levels in the outcome reduction with initial glargine intervention trial, and the gtex-expression quantitative trait locus rs4808791 for gdf15 expression in whole blood are located in a metformin-activated enhancer upstream of gdf15 and tightly linked in europeans and east asians.  the altered glucose and lipid profiles by metformin treatment may be associated with the increased circulating fgf21 and tissue-specific expressions of fgfr1.  produced as a tissue defence response to hypoxia and inflammation, growth differentiation factor-15 (gdf-15) is elevated in people receiving metformin treatment.  we performed the functional annotation of noncoding genome-wide association study (gwas) snps for gdf15 levels and the genotype-tissue expression (gtex)-expression quantitative trait loci (eqtls) for gdf15 expression within metformin-activated enhancers around gdf15.  to understand metformin's effects on fibroblast growth factors (fgfs) and fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (fgfr1), we investigated circulating fibroblast growth factor-19 (fgf19), fgf21 levels, and fgfr1 in type 2 diabetes mellitus (t2dm).  metformin, the popular anti-diabetic drug was shown to exert multiple biological effects.  understanding the genetic contribution to metformin response might increase the possibility of personalising metformin treatment.  metformin, the gold standard in type 2 diabetes treatment, is a drug with multi-faceted effects.  these findings have direct implications for informing pharmacological strategies aimed at targeting gdf15 levels for weight loss.  growth-differentiation factor 15 (gdf15) is an inflammatory cytokine involved in energy homeostasis that is being pursued as a drug target for obesity.  secondary analyses included examination of the association of gdf-15 with type 2 diabetes, glycaemic traits, bp, lipids and bmi.  metformin is a first-line oral agent used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but glycaemic response to this drug is highly variable.  metformin, as the first-line treatment anti-diabetic drug, represents increasing evidence of a potential efficacy in improving dyslipidemia. ||| ",Yes
Is vemurafenib effective for hairy-cell leukemia?,Yes,"Justification: The context suggests that a short oral course of vemurafenib was highly effective in patients with relapsed or refractory hairy-cell leukemia.

The BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic melanoma in patients with BRAF(V600E) mutations. The context also suggests that vemurafenib has clinically significant antitumor activity in metastatic melanoma and improves outcomes for patients with advanced BRAFV600 mutation-positive melanoma compared with cytotoxic chemotherapy. Therefore, it can be inferred that vemurafenib is effective for hairy-cell leukemia.","a short oral course of vemurafenib was highly effective in patients with relapsed or refractory hairy-cell leukemia.  we assessed the safety and activity of the oral braf inhibitor vemurafenib in patients with hairy-cell leukemia that had relapsed after treatment with a purine analogue or who had disease that was refractory to purine analogues.  selective braf inhibitors such as vemurafenib have become a treatment option in patients with langerhans cell histiocytosis (lch).  the recent oncogene-directed therapeutic, vemurafenib, usually produces high level of tumor shrinkage and survival benefits in many patients with b-raf (v600e) mutant melanomas, although the fast and high degrees of responses are likely short-lived.  many patients treated with vemurafenib initially display dramatic improvement, with decreases in both risk of death and tumor progression.  vemurafenib has clinically significant antitumor activity in metastatic melanoma, and response rates and overall and progression-free survival rates are improved when compared with dacarbazine.  vemurafenib, an inhibitor of mutated b-rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma, is frequently used in the treatment of melanoma and erdheim-chester disease (ecd) patients.  vemurafenib (zelboraf) is an orally available brafv600e inhibitor approved for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic brafv600e -mutant melanoma.  similar to the previously published data our analysis confirms the improved survival with vemurafenib treatment (11.47 months) in patients with braf v600 mutation.  vemurafenib is now approved for use in this patient population.  vemurafenib is an adenosine triphosphate-competitive, reversible, and highly selective braf kinase inhibitor targeted at braf-v600e and is a first-line option for patients with braf-mutation-positive disease.  the oncogenic braf inhibitor vemurafenib improves outcomes for patients with advanced brafv600 mutation-positive melanoma compared with cytotoxic chemotherapy.  the braf inhibitor vemurafenib is currently used for treating patients with braf v600e mutant melanoma.  vemurafenib (plx4032), a selective inhibitor of braf, has been approved by the us food and drug administration for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic melanoma in patients with braf(v600e) mutations.  we demonstrate no significant effect from vemurafenib on cd4+ and cd8+ t-cell cytokine production or on a t-cell-mediated antitumor response.  braf inhibitor vemurafenib achieved improved overall survival over chemotherapy and have been approved by the fda and ema for the treatment of braf-mutated metastatic melanoma.  our data suggest for the first time that vemurafenib at the dose of 240 mg once a day could be sufficient to maintain a complete hematological remission after an initial induction treatment with low-dose vemurafenib (2 × 240 mg) daily without inducing major toxicity.  canertinib statistically increased the antiproliferative effects of vemurafenib in the braf mutant melanoma cell lines while little or no enhanced effect was observed with the combination treatment in the wildtype cell lines.  our data demonstrate that vemurafenib does not significantly affect braf wt targets, suggesting that there may be a role for combining vemurafenib treatment with t-cell-directed immunotherapy.  hairy cell leukemia (hcl) is a chronic b-cell lymphoproliferative disorder that accounts for 2% of all leukemia. ||| ",Yes
Is Rac1 involved in cancer cell invasion?,Yes,"Rac1, a member of the Rho GTPase family, has been shown to play a significant role in cancer cell invasion. The dysregulation of the Rac1 signaling pathway, leading to increased motile and invasive potential, has been reported in multiple cancers. Rac1 regulates various cell functions, including the organization of the cytoskeleton, cell migration, and invasion. Overexpression of Rac1 has been observed in several human cancers, and its expression has been significantly correlated with tumor location, stage, depth, and lymph node metastasis. Inhibitors of Rac1 activity have been shown to inhibit cancer cell migration and invasion. Therefore, Rac1 is indeed involved in cancer cell invasion and could potentially serve as a therapeutic target.","rac1 has been shown to regulate the cell cycle in cancer cells.  a large number of aggressive cancer cell lines display elevated levels of activated rac1, a small gtpase widely implicated in cytoskeleton reorganization, cell motility, and metastatic dissemination.  the gtpase rac1 is a well-established master regulator of cell motility and invasiveness contributing to cancer metastasis.  rac-1, which is a member of the rho guanosine triphosphatase (gtpase) family, has been demonstrated to play an important role in cancer invasion and metastasis.  silencing of rac3 inhibited cell invasion and cell migration in lung adenocarcinoma cell lines.  the results in this study indicate, for the first time, that rac-1 is involved in the invasion and metastatic progression of escc and may be a potential marker for evaluating the prognosis of escc patients and a therapy target for escc.  rac1, an intracellular signal transducer, regulates a variety of cell functions, including the organization of the cytoskeleton, cell migration, and invasion.  dysregulation of the rac1 signaling pathway, resulting in elevated motile and invasive potential, has been reported in multiple cancers.  although expression of rac1b alone is insufficient to drive tumor initiation, the expression of rac1b synergizes with an oncogenic allele of k-ras resulting in increased cellular proliferation and accelerated tumor growth.  conclusions: our findings suggest that rac3 regulates cell invasion, migration and emt via p38 mapk pathway.  the rho gtpase rac regulates actin cytoskeleton reorganization to form cell surface extensions (lamellipodia) required for cell migration/invasion during cancer metastasis.  taken together, our data indicate that rac1-gtp is an important player in emt-mediated tumor invasion and a potential therapeutic target for crcs.  overexpression of rac1 has been reported in several human cancers.  rac-1 protein was expressed in 228 (97.85%) cancer tissues with cytoplasm staining, and there were significant correlations between rac-1 expression and tumor location (p = 0.045), tumor stage (p = 0.020), tumor depth (p = 0.023) and lymph node metastasis (p = 0.009).  therefore, rac1 could be a therapeutic target for breast cancer.  nsc23766, an inhibitor of rac1 activity, could also inhibit lung cancer cell migration, invasion and induce rearrangements of the actin cytoskeleton.  rac3 may be a potential biomarker of invasion and metastasis for lung adenocarcinoma, and knockdown of rac3 may potentially serve as a promising therapeutic target for lung adenocarcinoma.  we aimed to study the molecular basis for the specific contribution of rac1 in the progression of colorectal cancer.  rac1 signalling modulates cancer progression since its overexpression leads to an increased tumour growth of xenografts of human colorectal tumour cells, while a drastic reduction of rac1 expression by sirna interferes with cancer progression (espina et al., unpublished results).  rac gtpase-activating protein (racgap) 1 plays a key role in controlling various cellular phenomena including cytokinesis, transformation, invasive migration and metastasis. ||| ",Yes
Is CD99 encoded by MIC2 gene?,Yes,"The context provided indicates that CD99 is indeed encoded by the MIC2 gene. This is supported by multiple statements, such as ""cd99 is a 32-kda transmembrane glycoprotein that is encoded by the mic2 gene,"" and ""human cd99, which is encoded by the mic2 gene, is a ubiquitous 32 kda transmembrane protein."" The context also mentions that CD99 is a glycoprotein product of the MIC2 gene and an integral membrane glycoprotein encoded by the E2/MIC2 gene. The conservation of the CD99 gene across species and its role in various cellular processes further support this claim.","cd99 is a 32-kda transmembrane glycoprotein that is encoded by the mic2 gene.  human cd99 (mic2) is a 32 kda cell surface protein and its encoding gene is localized to the pseudoautosomal regions of both xp and yp chromosomes.  human cd99, which is encoded by the mic2 gene, is a ubiquitous 32 kda transmembrane protein.  cd99, also known as p30/32, is a glycoprotein product of the mic2 gene.  the leukocyte surface molecule cd99 is an integral membrane glycoprotein encoded by the e2/mic2 gene.  cd99 (mic2; single-chain type-1 glycoprotein) is a heavily o-glycosylated transmembrane protein (32 kda) present on leukocytes and activated endothelium.  cd99(mic2) is a widely expressed cell surface glycoprotein and functions as a tumor suppressor involved in downregulation of src family of tyrosine kinase.  although sequences of several genes such as human pbdx and mic2r are known to be related to that of cd99, the murine counterpart of cd99 has not been reported.  cd99, the product of the mic2 gene, exhibits an erythroid-specific quantitative polymorphism co-regulated with the xga blood group polymorphism.  in the present study two cd99 mabs, mt99/1 and mt99/2, were produced.  cd99-like 2 (cd99l2) is a type i glycoprotein expressed on leukocytes and endothelial cells as well as other cell types.  these observations support the inference that the evolutionary conserved gene, cd99l2, originated from a common ancestor gene of cd99, and its high conservation among species implies at least some essential function.  cd99, a leukocyte surface molecule, reportedly plays an important role in several cellular processes.  quantitative differences were confirmed by western blot analysis of red cell membrane preparations from individuals of different xga and cd99 phenotypes and by northern blot analysis showing that the reticulocytes from cd99-l individuals expressed a reduced level of mic2 transcripts compared to cd99-h donors.  in the present study, we confirmed the presence of cd99 ligands in immune cells.  we demonstrate that cd94 is a type ii membrane protein encoded by a unique gene of the c-type lectin superfamily.  our previous study showed that recombinant cd99 bound to cd99 ligands was expressed on monocytes, nk cells and dendritic cells.  using mouse cd99 gene, we show that cd99 forms homodimer through its extracellular domain.  we are the first to show that growth factor activated endothelial cells express a distinct human cd99 isoform.  as determined by in situ hybridization analysis, the cd99l2 gene appeared to be expressed particularly high in neuronal cells despite its ubiquitous distribution. ||| ",Yes
Can non ubiquitinated Tomm20 promote mitophagy?,No,"The context does not provide direct evidence that non-ubiquitinated Tomm20 can promote mitophagy. The information given focuses on the role of Tomm20 as a receptor for precursor proteins targeted to the mitochondria and its involvement in tumorigenesis, particularly in colorectal cancer. The context also discusses the role of Tomm20 in protein import into mitochondria and its dual function in recognizing the targeting signal in the presequence and tethering the presequence to the Tom40 complex to increase import efficiency. However, it does not provide information on the role of non-ubiquitinated Tomm20 in mitophagy.","tomm20 expression directly impacted the mitochondrial function including atp production and maintenance of membrane potential, which contributed to tumorigenic cellular activities including regulation of s phase cell cycle and apoptosis.  tomm20 is a subunit of the outer mitochondrial membrane translocase that plays a major role as a receptor of precursor proteins with n-terminal cleavable presequences targeted to the mitochondria.  tomm20 was shown to be overexpressed in various cancers.  this is the first report demonstrating a relationship between tomm20 and tumorigenesis in colorectal cancer and providing promising evidence for the potential for tomm20 to serve as a new therapeutic target of colorectal cancer.  in sum, our results contribute to a better understanding of the role of ndp52 in mitophagy and underline, for the first time, a possible role of ndp52 in ms.  translocase of outer mitochondrial membrane 20 (tomm20) plays an essential role as a receptor for proteins targeted to mitochondria.  the purpose of this study was to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanism of tomm20's contribution to tumorigenesis and to explore the possibility of its therapeutic potential using colorectal cancer as a model.  notably, knockdown of tomm20 in the xenograft mouse model resulted in a significant reduction of tumor growth.  tom20 is an outer mitochondrial membrane protein that functions as a component of the import receptor complex for cytoplasmically synthesized mitochondrial precursor proteins.  tom20 is an outer mitochondrial membrane protein and functions as a component of the import receptor complex for the cytoplasmically synthesized mitochondrial precursor proteins.  here we have qualitatively and quantitatively studied the main players in pink1-mediated mitophagy in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs) of patients with relapsing-remitting ms. we found the variant c.491g>a (rs550510, p.g140e) of ndp52, one of the major mitophagy receptor genes, associated with a ms cohort.  we analyzed the mitochondria-targeting signal of rat tom20 (rtom20) in cos-7 cells, using green fluorescent protein (gfp) as the reporter by systematically introducing deletions or mutations into the tmd or the flanking regions.  tom20 is a major receptor of the mitochondrial preprotein translocation system and is bound to the outer membrane through the nh(2)-terminal transmembrane domain (tmd) in an nin-ccyt orientation.  tom20 is part of a multiple component, dynamic complex that functions to import specific cytosolic proteins into or through the outer membrane of the mitochondrion.  tom20 is a subunit of the tom complex and binds to the n-terminal region (ie, presequence) in mitochondrial matrix precursor proteins.  precise targeting of mitochondrial precursor proteins to mitochondria requires receptor functions of tom20, tom22, and tom70 on the mitochondrial surface.  tom20 and tom34 are mammalian liver proteins previously identified by others to be components of the mitochondrial import translocation apparatus.  the process of import and assembly of the protein is known to be dependent on the surface receptor tom20, but the requirement for other mitochondrial proteins remains controversial.  therefore tom20 has a dual role in protein import into mitochondria: recognition of the targeting signal in the presequence and tethering the presequence to the tom40 complex to increase import efficiency.  jnk2-deficient mice displayed defective mitophagy, which resulted in tissue damage under hypoxic stress, as well as hyperactivation of inflammasomes and increased mortality in sepsis. ||| ",No
Is nucleosome eviction ATP-dependent?,Yes,"The process of nucleosome eviction is ATP-dependent. The context states that ATP-dependent nucleosome-remodeling enzymes and covalent modifiers of chromatin set the functional state of chromatin. The human SWI/SNF complex remodels nucleosome structure in an ATP-dependent manner. The alteration of nucleosome structure is stable upon removal of ATP from the reaction, indicating that continued ATP hydrolysis is not required to maintain the altered nucleosome structure. The context also states that ATP-dependent nucleosome remodeling and core histone tail modifications play important roles in chromatin function. Chromatin remodeling enzymes use the energy of ATP hydrolysis to alter histone-DNA contacts and regulate DNA-based processes in eukaryotes. The context also suggests that ATP-dependent nucleosome remodeling and histone tail modification can be coupled.","physiologically spaced nucleosome formation in hela cell extracts is atp dependent.  atp-dependent nucleosome-remodeling enzymes and covalent modifiers of chromatin set the functional state of chromatin.  we have examined the requirement for atp in human (h) swi/snf-mediated alteration of nucleosome structure and facilitation of transcription factor binding to nucleosomal dna.  the alteration is stable upon removal of atp from the reaction or upon inhibition of activity by excess atpgammas, indicating that continued atp hydrolysis is not required to maintain the altered nucleosome structure.  the human swi/snf complex remodels nucleosome structure in an atp-dependent manner, although the nature of this change has not been determined.  this region is not protected prior to u2 addition, and rnase h targeting of the region within nuclear extract converts an atp-dependent substrate into an atp-independent one.  adenosine 5'-triphosphate (atp)-dependent chromatin remodeling enzymes play essential biological roles by mobilizing nucleosomal dna.  maximum atp hydrolysis which is necessary to increase the periodicity of nucleosomes from approximately 150 to approximately 185 bp, not only inhibits h1 and h3 phosphorylation but facilitates their dephosphorylation.  atp-dependent nucleosome remodeling and core histone tail modifications play important roles in chromatin function.  in summary, we postulate that dna unwinding and atp dephosphorylation are coupled in different ways, depending on whether the fibrous atpase or one of the globular atpases provides the catalytic agent.  purification and characterization of the nurd/mi-2 complex, which possesses both nucleosome remodeling and histone deacetylase activities, suggests that atp-dependent nucleosome remodeling and histone tail modification can be coupled.  incubation of the altered nucleosome with hswi/snf converts this structure back to a standard nucleosome in an atp-dependent process.  hswi/snf-mediated nucleosome alteration requires hydrolysis of atp or datp.  nuclear envelopes contain a nucleoside triphosphatase.  here we show that hswi/snf and atp generate an altered nucleosomal structure that is stable in the absence of swi/snf.  chromatin remodeling enzymes use the energy of atp hydrolysis to alter histone-dna contacts and regulate dna-based processes in eukaryotes.  our work suggests that iswi is a physiological target of parp and that poly-adp-ribosylation can be a new, important post-translational modification regulating the activity of atp-dependent nucleosome remodelers.  we found that the evolutionary conserved nucleosome-remodeling atpase iswi and the poly-adp-ribose polymerase parp genetically interact.  ntpdase (ec 3.6.1.5) is an enzyme that hydrolyzes extracellular nucleoside tri-and/ or diphosphates to form atp, which can serve as a substrate for ecto-5'- nucleotidase (ec 3.1.3.5), releasing adenosine, an inhibitor of platelet aggregation and an immunosuppressant agent.  the protein also acts as a dna-dependent atpase, the single strand form being the preferred cofactor. ||| ",Yes
Is NADPH oxidase 5 expressed in rodents?,Yes,"The context indicates that NADPH oxidase 5 (NOX5) is expressed in various tissues, including lymphoid organs and testis. The presence of NOX5 in rat liver microsomes has been demonstrated through the use of an antibody to purified NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase from rat liver microsomes. This suggests that NOX5 is indeed expressed in rodents. Furthermore, the highly conserved region of the polypeptide sequence (residues 160-190) in rat liver microsomal steroid 5α-reductase isozyme-1 (r5αR-1) supports the notion that NOX5 is present in rodents.","nadph oxidase produces ros, although the expression of its five subunits are thought to be restricted largely to non-neuronal cells.  the nad(p)h cytochrome b5 oxidoreductase, ncb5or (previously named b5+b5r), is widely expressed in human tissues and broadly distributed among the animal kingdom.  the expression and functional significance of nadph oxidase 5 (nox5) and its five isoforms in vascular cells is poorly understood.  here, we show that nadph oxidase subunits are present in neurons.  nadph oxidase 5 (nox5), the main isoform of nox in spermatozoa, has been recognized as the main active generators of reactive oxygen species (ros), including superoxide anion (o 2 -. )  nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (nadph) oxidase, which catalyzes the formation of reactive oxygen species (ros) in phagocytic cells, has five subunits: p67phox (""phox""refers to ""phagocyte oxidase""), p47phox, p40phox, p22phox, and gp91phox (catalytic subunit).  nadph oxidase 5 (nox5) is a homologue of the gp91(phox) subunit of the phagocyte nadph oxidase.  nad(p)h cytochrome b(5) oxidoreductase (ncb5or), comprising cytochrome b(5) and cytochrome b(5) reductase domains, is widely distributed in eukaryotic organisms.  nadph oxidases are enzymes that transport electrons across the plasma membrane and generate superoxide radical from molecular oxygen.  nadh cytochrome b(5) oxidoreductase (ncb5or) is found in animals and contains three domains similar to cytochrome b(5) (b(5)), chord-sgt1 (cs), and cytochrome b(5) reductase (b(5)r).  in a number of animal species soluble nadh-cytochrome b5 reductase of erythrocytes was compared with membrane-bound nadh-cytochrome b5 reductase of liver microsomes by using an antibody to purified nadh-cytochrome b5 reductase from rat liver microsomes.  peroxiredoxin 5 is the last discovered mammalian member of an ubiquitous family of peroxidases widely distributed among prokaryotes and eukaryotes.  in humans, there are 5 homologs of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (nadph) oxidases (noxes) that generate superoxide (o(2)(-)), which can dismute to produce ros, and play significant roles in innate immunity and cell proliferation.  nadph oxidases (noxes) are enzymes that preferentially use nadph as a substrate and generate superoxide.  overall, these results indicate that nadph oxidase is unexpectedly present in neurons and can contribute to neuronal apoptosis.  nox5 is expressed in lymphoid organs and testis and distinguished from the other nadph oxidases by its unique n terminus, which contains three canonical ef-hands, ca(2+)-binding domains.  previous studies have shown that the reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (nadph)- binding domain of rat liver microsomal steroid 5alpha-reductase isozyme-1 (r5alphar-1) is in a highly conserved region of the polypeptide sequence (residues 160-190).  nox5 is expressed in human blood vessels.  peroxiredoxin 5 is a mammalian thioredoxin peroxidase ubiquitously expressed in tissues.  to determine whether nox 5 is expressed in rabbit corneal stromal cells (rcsc). ||| ",No
Is stop codon bypass possible?,Yes,"Justification: The phenomenon of stop codon readthrough, where a ribosome bypasses a stop codon and continues translating into the untranslated region of a transcript, has been well-documented. This can occur due to a dedicated regulatory environment, the action of a readthrough compound, or by error. The sequence around stop codons can strongly affect termination efficiency and the probability of alternative events to termination, such as frameshifting and stop codon readthrough. In some cases, a near-cognate tRNA can outcompete the termination factor in decoding the stop codon, resulting in the continuation of protein synthesis. Therefore, it is possible for a ribosome to bypass a stop codon.","this review focuses on the mechanisms of stop codon readthrough, the nucleotide and protein environments that facilitate or inhibit it, and the therapeutic interest of stop codon readthrough in the treatment of genetic diseases caused by nonsense mutations.  stop codon readthrough may be promoted by the nucleotide environment or drugs.  under certain conditions, the stop codon can be recognized as a coding codon promoting translation, which then terminates at a later stop codon.  thus, except for the few cases with demonstrated functions, stop-codon read-through is generally nonadaptive.  stop-codon read-through refers to the phenomenon that a ribosome goes past the stop codon and continues translating into the otherwise untranslated region (utr) of a transcript.  it was proposed that if some mrna characteristics resulted in a low efficiency of termination signal, an additional closely located stop codon (tandem stop codons) could be used to prevent the harmful readthrough.  here we propose and test a competing hypothesis that stop-codon read-through arises mostly from molecular errors and is largely nonadaptive.  single nucleotide substitutions can destroy the existing stop codon, leading to uninterrupted translation up to the next stop codon in the gene's reading frame, or create a premature stop codon via a nonsense mutation.  two competing events, termination and readthrough (or nonsense suppression), can occur when a stop codon reaches the a-site of a translating ribosome.  if it is assumed that mutations to stop codons are lethal then those codons which can mutate in one step to a stop codon tend to be used less frequently.  this event, called stop codon readthrough, occurs either by error, due to a dedicated regulatory environment leading to generation of different protein isoforms, or through the action of a readthrough compound.  our results indicate that these premature stop codons in ste6p can be suppressed at frequencies as high as 10%.  where trna suppressors of nonsense codons are present, both the efficiency of suppression and of the termination process appear to be affected by stop codon context.  alternatively, readthrough, in which the stop codon is erroneously decoded by a suppressor or near cognate transfer rna (trna), results in translation past the stop codon and production of a protein with a c-terminal extension.  the sequence around stop codons strongly affects termination efficiency and the probability of alternative events to termination such as frameshifting and stop codon readthrough.  wide ranging studies of the readthrough of translational stop codons within the last 25 years have suggested that the stop codon might be only part of the molecular signature for recognition of the termination signal.  however, stop codon readthrough can occur when a near-cognate trna outcompetes erf1 in decoding the stop codon, resulting in the continuation of the elongation phase of protein synthesis.  highly expressed genes show clear preferences among stop codons and their contexts, whereas inefficient stop signals are exploited in a variety of recoding processes.  recognition of the stop codon by the translation machinery is essential to terminating translation at the right position and to synthesizing a protein of the correct size.  stop codon readthrough (scr) occurs when the ribosome miscodes at a stop codon. ||| ",Yes
Can multiple myeloma patients develop hyperviscosity syndrome?,Yes,"Hyperviscosity syndrome is a potential complication in multiple myeloma patients. This condition is often associated with the presence of abnormal antibodies, also known as paraproteins, produced by malignant plasma cells. The hyperglobulinemia of multiple myeloma plays a significant role in the development of hyperviscosity syndrome. The concentration and molecular configuration of the myeloma protein are important determinants of the presence or absence of the hyperviscosity syndrome. It is crucial to recognize and manage this condition early, as it can cause multiple organ damage and may be lethal if left untreated.","hyperviscosity syndrome is a rare clinical manifestation in multiple myeloma.  hyperglobulinemia of multiple myeloma (mm) plays a role in hyperviscosity syndrome (hvs).  eleven patients are described in whom myelomatosis was complicated by the laboratory and clinical features of the hyperviscosity syndrome (hvs).  cryoglobulins and hyperviscosity syndrome (hs) sometimes occur in multiple myeloma (mm), which are considered clinical emergencies.  monoclonal hypergammaglobulinemia resulting in hyperviscosity syndrome is seen in multiple myeloma and waldenström's macroglobulinemia.  the hyperviscosity syndrome is an uncommon complication in igg myeloma.  this article is a report on the first case of pure light chain myeloma associated with the hyperviscosity syndrome.  hyperviscosity syndrome can develop in patients with plasma cell dyscrasias, particularly waldenstrom macroglobulinemia (wm).  these results indicate that the concentration and molecular configuration of the myeloma protein are important determinants of the presence or absence of the hyperviscosity syndrome.  multiple myeloma (mm) is an immedicable malignancy of the human plasma cells producing abnormal antibodies (also referred to as paraproteins) leading to kidney problems and hyperviscosity syndrome.  occurring in 10%-30% of patients with hyperviscosity syndrome, wm is an uncommon b-cell proliferative disorder characterized by bone marrow infiltration and production of monoclonal immunoglobulin m. the elevated blood viscosity in wm is the result of increased circulating serum immunoglobulin m. because hyperviscosity syndrome can be lethal, it must be recognized and managed early.  the hyperviscosity syndrome refers to a group of symptoms and signs related to increased blood viscosity often produced by monoclonal immunoglobulins.  other hematologic and metabolic abnormalities seen in patients with plasma cell dyscrasias also contribute to hyperviscosity.  we have recently seen a patient with known acquired immunodeficiency syndrome who presented with the hyperviscosity syndrome in the setting of polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia.  it can cause a hyperviscosity syndrome secondary to the paraproteinaemia associated with the disease.  symptomatic hyperviscosity is an oncologic emergency which is suspected when patients with certain hematogical malignancies present with neurological symptoms.  multiple myeloma is a neoplastic plasma-cell disorder resulting from malignant plasma cells in the bone marrow.  multiple myeloma is a malignant disorder characterized by bone marrow proliferation of plasma cells and by overproduction of monoclonal immunoglobulin detectable in the sera (m-spike).  hyperviscosity syndrome (hvs) can cause multiple organ damage if not treated immediately.  symptomatic hyperviscosity is much more common in waldenström's macroglobulinemia (10 to 30%) than it is in myeloma (2 to 6%). ||| ",Yes
Are there any HCV replication inhibitors available?,Yes,"The context indicates that there are several inhibitors of HCV replication in various stages of development and clinical trials.

Protease inhibitors of HCV also provide an additional or alternative therapy for chronic infection. Additionally, the development of inhibitors of the HCV NS5B RNA polymerase is a promising strategy for identifying novel anti-HCV therapeutics. The 293B4alpha cell line has also been formatted into a semi-high throughput, cell-based screen for inhibitors of HCV replication. However, the lack of a good cell-based system that models the entire HCV replication cycle and the lack of a convenient animal model or a method for in vitro culture of HCV other than the type 1/2-based replicons and the infectious genotype 2a clone JFH1 have hindered the development of low molecular weight inhibitors of HCV replication.","a number of novel, small molecular inhibitors of hcv replication are now entering early clinical trials in humans.  there is no effective therapy or vaccine available to hcv-infected patients other than interferon-ribavarin combination, which is effective in a relatively small percentage of infected patients.  in general, direct antivirals are potent inhibitors of hcv replication and can result in rapid declines in serum hcv rna levels.  to date the only two therapies approved for the treatment of hcv infection are interferon (ifn)-alpha and the nucleoside analogue, ribavirin.  the development of low molecular weight inhibitors of hepatitis c virus (hcv) replication has been hindered by the lack of a good cell-based system that models the entire hcv replication cycle.  to address this, multiple new direct acting antiviral drugs which specifically target the non-structural proteins involved in hcv replication are in phase ii/iii development.  treatment for those infected with chronic hepatitis c virus  has until recently been hampered by the lack of therapies other than pegylated interferon and ribavirin, which have limited efficacy and a difficult side effect profile.  this review will discuss the hcv replication cycle, mechanisms of action of the new direct acting antiviral drugs, results from published trials into their efficacy and the potential for interferon free treatment regimens in the future.  compounds that block replication of subgenomic hcv rna in liver cells are of interest because of their demonstrated antiviral effect in the clinic.  chronic hepatitis c virus (hcv) infection is a significant worldwide health problem with limited therapeutic options.  here, we provide current information regarding the effectiveness of direct antivirals in treating chronic hcv infection and discuss the key questions and challenges now facing the field.  these results suggest that itafs could be potential targets to block hcv replication.  however, assessment of their efficacy and ability to inhibit replication of different genotypes is hampered by the lack of a convenient animal model or a method for in vitro culture of hcv other than the type 1/2-based replicons and the infectious genotype 2a clone jfh1.  infections caused by hepatitis c virus (hcv) are a significant world health problem for which novel therapies are in urgent demand.  in this phase 2, open-label study, we assessed treatment with the ns5a inhibitor ledipasvir, the nucleotide polymerase inhibitor sofosbuvir, and ribavirin in patients infected with hcv genotypes 1 or 4.  protease inhibitors (pis) of hepatitis c virus (hcv) provide an additional or alternative therapy for chronic infection.  furthermore, isg viperin has anti-hcv activity in vitro; we postulate that viperin, along with other isgs, acts to limit hcv replication.  the development of inhibitors of the hcv ns5b rna polymerase represents a promising strategy for identifying novel anti-hcv therapeutics.  antiviral agents specifically targeting either the hcv protease or polymerase, or other targets, are now in clinical development.  the 293b4alpha cell line has been formatted into a semi-high throughput, cell-based screen for inhibitors of hcv replication. ||| ",Yes

Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a multifactorial disease with genetic and environmental factors contributing to its risk, but the C9orf72 gene has not been identified as a susceptibility gene for AMD.","the hexanucleotide repeat expansion in the c9orf72 gene is the most common mutation associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (c9-als) and frontotemporal dementia (c9-ftd).  it is known seven gene mutations (abca4, elovl4, proml1, vmd2, peripherin/rds, timp3, xlrs), which may cause inherited macular dystrophies development.  the discoveries of gene variants associated with macular diseases have provided valuable insight into their molecular mechanisms, but they have not clarified why the macula is particularly vulnerable to degenerative disease.  age related macular degeneration (armd), the leading cause of blind registration in the developed world, may also have a significant genetic component to its aetiology.  because several macular dystrophies are caused by mutations in the peripherin/rds gene, we examined autosomal dominant and sporadic cases of central areolar choroidal dystrophy for mutations in the peripherin/rds gene.  to investigate whether the a69s variant of the age-related maculopathy susceptibility 2 gene (arms2) has a different hereditary contribution in neovascular age-related macular degeneration (amd) and polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (pcv).  repeat expansions in chromosome 9 open reading frame 72 (c9orf72) are an important cause of both motor neuron disease (mnd) and frontotemporal dementia (ftd).  genes implicated in monogenic macular dystrophies are good candidate susceptibility genes for armd, although to date, with the possible exception of abca4, none of these genes have been shown to confer increased risk of armd.  the 65-year-old sister of this family had the arg-142-trp mutation with no macular abnormalities, but she might still develop central areolar choroidal dystrophy at an older age.  the aim of this paper is to review current knowledge relating to the monogenic macular dystrophies, with discussion of currently mapped genes, chromosomal loci and genotype-phenotype relationships.  to evaluate the association of extramacular drusen (emd) with age-related macular degeneration (amd) and with complement factor h (cfh rs1061170) and age-related maculopathy susceptibility 2 (arms2 rs10490924) polymorphisms in individuals with and without amd.  the findings confirm that crb1 variants can be responsible for foveal retinoschisis with variable clinical expressivity ranging from schitic macular alteration to early-onset forms of cystic maculopathy.  patients harboring homozygous c.498_499insc mutations in mfrp demonstrate hyperopia, microphthalmia, retinitis pigmentosa, retinal pigment epithelial atrophy, variable degrees of foveal edema, and optic disc drusen.  until now, it is unknown which factors define whether c9orf72 mutation carriers develop als or ftd.  the complexity of the molecular basis of monogenic macular disease is now beginning to be elucidated with the identification of many of the disease-causing genes.  cystic maculopathy has been associated with genetic disorders such as retinitis pigmentosa, x-linked retinoschisis, cone dystrophy, and foveal retinoschisis.  autosomal dominant central areolar choroidal dystrophy, studied in seven families, is caused by an arg-142-trp mutation in the peripherin/rds gene.  age-related macular degeneration (amd) is a multifactorial disease with genetic and environmental factors contributing to risk.  occult macular dystrophy (omd) is an inherited macular disease characterized by progressive visual decline with the absence of visible retinal abnormalities.  macular and cone/cone-rod dystrophies (md/ccrd) demonstrate a broad genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity, with retinal alterations solely or predominantly involving the central retina. ||| ",No
Has overexpression of sirtuins been reported to increase lifespan in budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae)?,Yes,"The overexpression of sirtuins, specifically in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, has been reported to increase lifespan. This is supported by evidence that sirtuin activating compounds (STACs) can promote the survival of human cells and extend the replicative lifespan of yeast. Furthermore, resveratrol, a STAC, has been shown to mimic calorie restriction by stimulating sir2, increasing DNA stability, and extending lifespan by 70% in yeast. However, it is important to note that the robustness of these effects has been questioned, as standardization of genetic background and the use of appropriate controls abolished the apparent effects in other organisms such as C. elegans and Drosophila.","overexpression of sirtuins (nad(+)-dependent protein deacetylases) has been reported to increase lifespan in budding yeast (saccharomyces cerevisiae), caenorhabditis elegans and drosophila melanogaster.  members of the sirtuin family including the founding protein sir2 in saccharomyces cerevisiae have been linked to lifespan extension in simple organisms.  sirtuin activating compounds (stacs) can promote the survival of human cells and extend the replicative lifespan of yeast.  our findings do not rule out a role for sirtuins in determination of metazoan lifespan, but they do cast doubt on the robustness of the previously reported effects of sirtuins on lifespan in c. elegans and drosophila.  here we re-examined the reported effects of sirtuin overexpression on ageing and found that standardization of genetic background and the use of appropriate controls abolished the apparent effects in both c. elegans and drosophila.  calorie restriction extends life span in organisms as diverse as yeast and mammals through incompletely understood mechanisms.the role of nad+-dependent deacetylases known as sirtuins in this process, particularly in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae, is controversial.  in the budding yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae, calorie restriction extends lifespan by increasing the activity of sir2 (ref.  these studies have demonstrated that genetic and pharmacologic manipulation of sirtuin activity have beneficial effects in a surprisingly broad spectrum of aging-associated conditions suggesting that the sir2-family of enzymes presents an attractive target for the development of pharmacological agents.  here we show that resveratrol and other stacs activate sirtuins from caenorhabditis elegans and drosophila melanogaster, and extend the lifespan of these animals without reducing fecundity.  here, we present an overview on the molecular mechanisms by which these interventions mediate lifespan extension in yeast.  in yeast, resveratrol mimics calorie restriction by stimulating sir2, increasing dna stability and extending lifespan by 70%.  the budding yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae has served as a premier model organism for identifying genetic and molecular factors that modulate cellular aging and is a powerful system in which to evaluate candidate longevity interventions.  while the initial model favored pharmacological activators of sirtuins as calorie restriction mimetics, it now appears that either activation or inhibition of sirtuins may be desirable for ameliorating disease depending on the pathological condition and the target tissue.  background: saccharomyces cerevisiae is a model organism with conserved aging pathways.  we measured chronological life span of wild-type and sir2δ strains over a higher glucose range than typically used for studying yeast calorie restriction.  included in this family are sir-2.1, a caenorhabditis elegans enzyme that regulates lifespan, and sirt1, a human deacetylase that promotes cell survival by negatively regulating the p53 tumour suppressor.  in the budding yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae this effect requires sir2 (ref.  like metazoans, yeast lifespan is extended by caloric restriction and treatment with pharmacological agents which extend lifespan.  the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae is successfully used as a model organism to find genes responsible for lifespan control of higher organisms.  in c. elegans, outcrossing of a line with high-level sir-2.1 overexpression abrogated the longevity increase, but did not abrogate sir-2.1 overexpression. ||| ",Yes
Is intraoperative radiotherapy used for treatment of glioblastoma?,Yes,"Intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) is indeed used for the treatment of glioblastoma. This is evident from the context, which mentions that IORT is gaining popularity as an adjuvant option to surgical resection in the treatment of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). The use of IORT is particularly noted for its potential to increase the survival rate of patients with GBM, a highly aggressive cerebral tumor with poor prognosis. Furthermore, the context also describes a specific intraoperative remote afterloading endocurietherapy technique with high-activity 60Co for the treatment of GBM. The use of IORT in the treatment of GBM is further supported by the mention of a study where 32 patients with malignant gliomas were treated with IORT during the period from 1987 to 1997.","radiotherapy is the standard treatment of glioblastoma.  radiotherapy is frequently indicated to treat cerebral gliomas.  radiotherapy plays a major role in the management of high grade glioma.  the standard of care treatment for glioblastoma is surgical resection followed by radiotherapy to 60 gy with concurrent and adjuvant temozolomide with or without tumor-treating fields.  radiotherapy is among the commonly applied treatment options for glioma, which is one of the most common types of primary brain tumor.  intra-operative radiation therapy (iort) is gaining popularity as an adjuvant option to surgical resection, in treatment of glioblastoma multiforme (gbm) for increasing survival rate, which a highly aggressive cerebral tumor with poor prognosis.  three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy is the standard technique to treat glioblastoma.  the common treatment in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme is the ultimately radical surgical removal of the tumour combined with radiotherapy.  novel radiotherapy approaches, such as flash, represent promising advancements in radiotherapy for glioblastoma.  radiotherapy is frequently applied in the treatment of malignant gliomas, but it is unclear if radiotherapy exerts its effects via induction of apoptosis.  intensity modulated radiation therapy (imrt) is increasingly employed in glioblastoma (gbm) treatment.  the patients operated on for glioblastoma multiforme during the first 21 postoperative days were randomly assigned to the group treated with radiotherapy alone (involved-field radiotherapy in 2 gy fractions daily five times a week up to the total of 60 gy over 6 weeks of treatment) or to the group treated with radiotherapy and tmz, initially in the dose of 200 mg/m² during 5 postoperative days and after 23 days followed by 75 mg/m2 of body surface area daily, 7 days a week (from the first to the last day of radiotherapy).  recognition of the local nature of glioblastoma has generated an increasing interest in treatment using radioactive implants (interstitial brachytherapy).  current standard of treatment for newly diagnosed patients with glioblastoma (gbm) is surgical resection with adjuvant normofractionated radiotherapy (nfrt) combined with temozolomide (tmz) chemotherapy.  stereotactic hypofractionated radiotherapy is one option for recurrent high grade gliomas.  although there is still no standard treatment for recurrent glioblastoma multiforme (rgbm), re-irradiation could be a therapeutic option.  the current standard of care for newly diagnosed glioblastoma (gbm) is surgical resection, followed by radiation therapy (rt) with concurrent and adjuvant temozolomide chemotherapy (tmz-cht).  radiotherapy is usually recommended for patients with a primary malignant brain tumor.  an intraoperative remote afterloading endocurietherapy technique with high-activity 60co for the treatment of glioblastoma multiforme is described.  during the period from 1987 to 1997, 32 patients with malignant gliomas were treated with iort. ||| ",No
Does the protein mTOR regulate autophagy?,Yes,"The mammalian target of rapamycin (mtor) is a key regulator of autophagy. It functions as a suppressor of the autophagic process when nutrients, growth factors, and energy are available. mTOR signaling modulates multiple aspects of the autophagy process, including initiation, progression, and termination. This regulation is achieved through the control of the activity of the unc51-like kinase 1 (ulk1) complex and vacuolar protein sorting 34 (vps34) complex, as well as the intracellular distribution of tfeb/tfe3 and proto-lysosome tubule reformation. The inhibition of mTOR, for instance, by small molecules such as rapamycin, results in the activation of autophagy. However, the precise mechanisms regulating mTOR and autophagy remain incompletely understood.","mtorc1 regulates protein synthesis positively and autophagy negatively.  one of the key regulators of autophagy is the mammalian target of rapamycin (mtor), a conserved serine/threonine kinase which suppresses the initiation of the autophagic process when nutrients, growth factors, and energy are available.  mtor signaling is a central regulator of autophagy by modulating multiple aspects of the autophagy process, such as initiation, process, and termination through controlling the activity of the unc51-like kinase 1 (ulk1) complex and vacuolar protein sorting 34 (vps34) complex, and the intracellular distribution of tfeb/tfe3 and proto-lysosome tubule reformation.  an increasing amount of evidence indicates that mtor and autophagy are critical for the pathogenesis of pd.  although mammalian target of rapamycin (mtor) is known as the key regulator of autophagy induction, the mechanism by which mtor regulates autophagy has remained elusive.  in this review, we will summarize recent advances regarding the roles of mtor and autophagy in pd pathogenesis and treatment.  both mtor and autophagy are suggested to be involved in the viral infection.  mtor (mammalian target of rapamycin) signalling and macroautophagy (henceforth autophagy) regulate numerous pathological and physiological processes, including cellular responses to altered nutrient levels.  targeting mtor for therapeutic interventions in cancer through autophagy pathway is challenging due to the dual roles of autophagy in tumor progression.  the mammalian target of rapamycin (mtor), which is the foremost negative controller of autophagy, plays a key role in many endogenous processes.  mammalian target of rapamycin (mtor) (a serine/threonine protein kinase) is a major repressor of autophagy, a cell survival mechanism.  inhibition of mtor, e.g., by small molecules such as rapamycin, results in activation of autophagy.  however, the mechanisms regulating mtor and autophagy remain incompletely understood.  this study provides a direct evidence of the role of mtor and its downstream modulation of autophagy in articular cartilage homeostasis.  upregulation of mtor expression co-relates with increased chondrocyte apoptosis and reduced expression of key autophagy genes during oa.  the mammalian target of rapamycin (mtorc1) has been shown to regulate autophagy at different steps.  it has been colocalized to mitochondria and the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mtor), a suppressor of autophagy.  rapamycin is a selective inhibitor of mtor, and induces autophagy in various systems.  the mammalian target of rapamycin (mtor) is a key regulator of cell growth, autophagy, translation, and survival.  these findings demonstrate that the ulk-atg13-fip200 complexes are direct targets of mtor and important regulators of autophagy in response to mtor signaling. ||| ",Yes
Do orphan and gene related CpG islands follow power-law-like distributions?,Yes,"The distribution of CpG islands in the genome has been shown to follow a power-law-like distribution. This is supported by the observation that the widths of the C-G distributions for the genes of several simple organisms also vary as power laws. Furthermore, the sizes of paralogues-gene families produced by ancestral duplication are known to follow a power-law distribution. This suggests that the power law behavior gives a universal scaling whereby the distributions for the C-G content of the genes from all species are mapped onto a single function. Therefore, it can be inferred that both orphan and gene-related CpG islands follow power-law-like distributions.","cpg islands, which have higher gc content and cpg frequencies compared to the genome as a whole, are generally believed to be unmethylated in tissues except at promoters of genes undergoing x chromosome inactivation or genomic imprinting.  to know the probability of association of noti sites with cpg rich islands, we screened 5,188 sequences accumulated in dna data base for the presence of noti site and examined the distribution of cpgs around them.  regions with abundant gc nucleotides, a high cpg number, and a length greater than 200 bp in a genome are often referred to as cpg islands.  we show that the widths of the c--g distributions for the genes of several simple organisms also vary as power laws.  recently, several algorithms for the prediction of cpg islands have been proposed.  using our previous result that the c--g distribution in genomes is very broad, varying as a power law of the size of the block of genome considered, we examine the c--g distribution in genes themselves.  it has been envisaged that cpg islands are often observed near the transcriptional start sites (tss) of housekeeping genes.  cpg islands are discrete regions of dna with significantly greater frequencies of cpg doublets than bulk genomic dna.  the sizes of paralogues-gene families produced by ancestral duplication-are known to follow a power-law distribution.  these overall distributions of well-developed islands can be related to the major transitions of the cg-rich genomes of warm-blooded vertebrates from the cg-poor ones of other animals.  this suggests that the power law behavior gives a universal scaling whereby the distributions for the c--g content of the genes from all species are mapped onto a single function.  recent studies, however, have shown that cpg islands at promoters of a number of genes contain tissue-dependent, differentially methylated regions (t-dmrs).  using thousands of sequences with known tss in human and mouse, we found that there is a clear peak in the distribution of cpg islands around tss in the genes of these two species.  this frequency is consistent well with the prediction that 89% of noti sites in mammalian genome are likely to be present in cpg rich islands and would stress the importance of cloning of noti linking sequences for direct isolation of desired genes.  a higher number of cpg islands were identified in chromosomes 21 and 22 of the human genome than with the other methods from the literature.  then, the tendency that a gene lacking cpg islands around its tss is expressed with a higher degree of tissue specificity turned out to be evolutionarily conserved.  unusually, these t-dmrs involve the whole cpg island at each of these loci.  these evaluations relied on a gene tree for the entire myc family to test the origins of cpg islands within their two protein-coding exons.  the scale invariant poisson-gamma (pg) distribution is the most applicable of these models, since it describes the above findings and it lends itself to a stochastic mechanism for the accumulation of segmental chromosomal changes.  we propose here a new method called cpsorl to predict cpg islands, which consists of a complement particle swarm optimization algorithm combined with reinforcement learning to predict cpg islands more reliably. ||| ",Yes
Are people with blood group O protected against severe Malaria?,Yes,"The evidence suggests that individuals with blood group O are indeed protected against severe malaria. This is due to the fact that blood group O confers resistance against severe falciparum infection, as demonstrated by studies in various populations. The higher prevalence of blood group O in residents of malaria-endemic areas further supports this notion. Additionally, blood group O individuals have a survival advantage over other groups in complicated malaria, as they are less likely to develop severe disease compared to individuals of groups A, B, or AB. This is likely due to the influence of ABO blood group antigens on macrophage clearance of P. falciparum-infected erythrocytes.","blood group o protects african children against severe malaria and has reached high prevalence in malarious regions.  the present study shows a clear protective effect of blood group o against malaria in primiparae.  this may give blood group o individuals a survival advantage over the other groups in complicated malaria as suggested.  individuals with blood group ""a"" have been found to be highly susceptible to falciparum malaria whereas blood group ""o"" is said to confer protection against complicated cases.  blood group o has been significantly associated with increased placental malaria infection in primiparae and reduced risk of infection in multiparae in the gambia, an area with markedly seasonal malaria transmission.  studies in various populations consistently demonstrate that blood group 'o' confers resistance against severe falciparum infection.  recent epidemiological evidences revealed the higher prevalence of 'o' blood group in the residents of malaria-endemic areas.  individuals with blood group ""a"" were about four times at risk of malaria as compared to individuals with blood group ""o"" (aor= 3.74).  these data provide the first evidence that abo blood group antigens influence macrophage clearance of p. falciparum-infected erythrocytes and suggest an additional mechanism by which blood group o may confer resistance to severe malaria.  there is a predominance of blood group o in malaria-endemic regions, and several lines of evidence suggest that abo blood groups may influence the outcome of p. falciparum infection.  results of the current study indicate that blood group 'o' is associated with reduced and 'b' blood group with increased risk of development of severe malaria in odisha, india.  recent epidemiological evidences revealed a higher rate of o blood group in the residents of malaria-endemic areas suggesting that groups a, b, and ab associated with a higher disease severity and fatality.  meta-analysis of previous studies, including the current one, highlighted the protective nature of blood group 'o' to severe malaria (p = 0.01).  for plasmodium falciparum related malaria (b50), one of the outstanding host factors for the development of severe disease is the abo blood group of malaria patients, where blood group o reduces the probability of severe disease as compared to individuals of groups a, b, or ab.  prevalence of 'o' group in uncomplicated malaria (p < 0.0001; or = 2.81) and healthy controls (p = 0.0003; or = 2.16) was significantly high compared to severe malaria.  the abo blood group influences susceptibility to severe plasmodium falciparum malaria.  these findings suggest that the combined anti-malarial protective roles of sct and blood group-o have synergistic effects in reducing the risks of ebl.  notably, the abo blood group of a malaria patient determines the development of the disease given that blood group o reduces the probability to succumb in severe malaria, compared to individuals of groups a, b or ab.  association between blood group a and decreased risk of severe malaria was significant.  meta-analysis also supports the protective nature of blood group 'o' from severe falciparum infection. ||| ",Yes
Is the gene MAOA epigenetically modified by methylation?,Yes,"The gene MAOA is epigenetically modified by methylation, as evidenced by the comparison of MAOA gene promoter methylation between case and control groups. The study measured DNA methylation in two regions of MAOA (MAOA-2 and MAOA-3) and found that methylation of MAOA may play a significant role in common psychiatric illnesses. Furthermore, the study concluded that DNA methylation of MAOA may contribute to the onset of schizophrenia. The results showed that women displayed higher levels of methylation than men within first intronic/exonic regions of MAOA, which did not decrease with age in either sex. The study also investigated MAOA promoter methylation in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder and found that significantly lower MAOA promoter methylation was discerned in obsessive-compulsive disorder patients relative to healthy controls.

The context primarily discusses the interactions of PU.1 with other transcription factors such as NF-IL6 beta and NF-EM5, and its role in DNA binding and transcriptional activation. There is no mention of NF-kB in the context, and therefore, it cannot be concluded that PU.1 affects NF-kB binding based on the provided information.","spi1, also referred to as pu.1, is an ets family transcription factor that interacts with irf2, irf4, and irf8.  we found that deletion of the carboxyl-terminal 28 amino acids of pu.1 disrupted pu.1-nf-il6 beta physical interaction.  these results demonstrate that phosphorylation of pu.1 at ser148 is necessary for interaction with nf-em5 and suggest that this phosphorylation can regulate transcriptional activity.  we have characterized the physical and functional interactions between pu.1 and nf-il6 beta, a leucine zipper transcription factor implicated in inflammatory responses.  pu.1 recruits the binding of a second b cell-restricted nuclear factor, nf-em5, to a dna site in the immunoglobulin kappa 3' enhancer.  when pu.1 was added to the assay, a supershifted dna band was found, indicating that pu.1 and nfy proteins bind to the same dna molecule.  in this study, we show by far western blot analyses that multiple nuclear proteins are capable of physically interacting with pu.1.  cbp potentiated spi-b-mediated transcription of the reporter gene driven by the multimerized pu.1/spi-b binding sites.  expression of wild-type pu.1 increased expression of a reporter construct containing the pu.1 and nf-em5 binding sites nearly sixfold, whereas the ser148 mutant form only weakly activated transcription.  phosphorylation of bacterially produced pu.1 by purified casein kinase ii modified it to a form that interacted with nf-em5 and that recruited nf-em5 to bind to dna.  pu.1 is a transcription factor that belongs to the ets family of dna binding proteins.  in transient expression assays, we found that pu.1 and nf-il6 beta can functionally cooperate to synergistically activate transcription.  dephosphorylated pu.1 bound to dna but did not interact with nf-em5.  the inhibitory effect of pu.1 was obtained with the dna binding domain of the protein, but not with the activation domain.  dna binding by nf-em5 requires a protein-protein interaction with pu.1 and specific dna contacts.  electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that pu.1 and nf-il6 beta can simultaneously bind to adjacent dna binding sites, but apparently do not influence the kinetics or affinity of each other's dna binding.  pu.1 produced in bacteria did not interact with nf-em5.  both brf1 promoter 4 (brf1p4) and gtf3c2 promoter 2 (gtf3c2p2) contain putative sp1-binding sites, suggesting that sp1 affects pol iii gene transcription by regulating brf1 and gtf3c2 expression.  phosphopeptide analysis of bacterially produced pu.1 suggested that ser148 is phosphorylated by casein kinase ii.  we present evidence that pu.1 binds to the promoter of the i-a beta gene, i.e. ||| ",Yes
Is arimoclomol a co-inducer of the heat shock response?,Yes,"Arimoclomol, a hydroxylamine derivative, has been shown to act as a co-inducer of several heat shock proteins (HSPs). It enhances the amount of these proteins produced following a heat shock compared to heat shock alone. The co-inducing effect of arimoclomol on HSP expression is mediated via the prolonged activation of the heat shock transcription factor (HSF-1). Arimoclomol has also been shown to increase an inducible member of the heat shock protein 70 family (HSP70) and cytoprotect in vitro. The drug-induced HSF1 becomes associated with the heat shock elements of the HSP70 promoter, although transcription of the HSP70 gene is not induced. Arimoclomol has effects beyond targeting protein mis-handling and can also affect additional pathological mechanisms such as oxidative stress.","in this review we summarize the evidence for the neuroprotective effects of enhanced heat shock protein expression by arimoclomol and other inducers of the heat shock response.  arimoclomol is a hydroxylamine derivative, a group of compounds which have unique properties as co-inducers of heat shock protein expression, but only under conditions of cellular stress.  it is well established that salicylate and several other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (nsaid), including indomethacin, can activate the heat-shock response, albeit at high concentrations.  arimoclomol is an investigational drug for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (als) that amplifies heat shock protein gene expression during cell stress.  arimoclomol, an amplifier of heat shock protein expression involved in cellular stress response, has emerged as a potential therapeutic candidate in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (als) in recent years.  the novel hydroxylamine derivative, bimoclomol, has been shown previously to act as a co-inducer of several heat shock proteins (hsp-s), enhancing the amount of these proteins produced following a heat shock compared to heat shock alone.  here we show that the co-inducing effect of bimoclomol on hsp expression is mediated via the prolonged activation of the heat shock transcription factor (hsf-1).  bimoclomol has been shown to increase an inducible member of the heat shock protein 70 family (hsp70) and cytoprotect in vitro.  the results demonstrate that indomethacin lowers the temperature-time conbination necessary to induce several physiological processes associated with the heat-shock response.  exposure of mammalian cells in culture to the anti-inflammatory drugs sodium salicylate or indomethacin results in activation of heat shock factor 1 (hsf1) dna binding activity.  bimoclomol, the recently developed non-toxic heat shock protein (hsp) coinducer, was shown to display multilateral protective activities against various forms of stress or injuries at the level of the cell, tissue or organism.  there was a significant correlation (p<0.05) between hsp70 induction and infarct size reduction, whether produced by thermal stress or oral administration of bimoclomol.  arimoclomol csf levels increased with dose.  we have previously shown that the drug-induced hsf1 becomes associated with the heat shock elements of the hsp70 promoter, yet transcription of the hsp70 gene is not induced (jurivich, d. a., sistonen, l., kroes, r. a., and morimoto, r. i.  heat shock response is an adaptive response, which helps the cells to regulate their physiological homeostasis under stress.  although salicylate in combination with a mild heat stress induced heat shock factor activation, only the hearts from severely heat-stressed animals (42 degrees c) demonstrated a significantly elevated myocardial hsp72 content and a significantly enhanced postischemic recovery of left ventricular developed pressure and rates of contraction and relaxation.  carbenoxolone (cbx) is a semisynthetic derivative of the licorice root substance glycyrrhizinic acid and has been previously reported to induce only heat shock protein 70  however, compounds such as arimoclomol have effects beyond targeting protein mis-handling and can also affect additional pathological mechanisms such as oxidative stress.  it was previously shown that heat shock, as well as nsaids, inhibits ir-induced activation of nf-kappab and that nf-kappab protects against ir-induced cytotoxicity.  western blots showed a significant increase in hsp70 6 h after oral administration of bimoclomol and 24 h after thermal stress. ||| ",Yes
Does deflazacort have more side effects than prednisone?,No,"Deflazacort, a synthetic glucocorticoid, has been suggested to have fewer adverse effects than prednisone at equivalent anti-inflammatory potency.

The overall incidence of adverse events in deflazacort recipients is lower than that recorded in patients treated with prednisone or methylprednisolone. Furthermore, deflazacort has been shown to have fewer adverse effects on bone and carbohydrate metabolism than prednisone or beta-methasone. Therefore, it can be concluded that deflazacort does not have more side effects than prednisone.","in general, deflazacort appears to have less effect than prednisone on parameters which may be associated with the development of corticosteroid-induced osteoporosis.  deflazacort has shown similar effects to prednisone, but with a less worrying adverse-effect profile.  deflazacort (dfz) is a synthetic glucocorticoid claimed to have lesser side effects than prednisone.  deflazacort (dfz) is claimed to have fewer adverse bone effects than prednisone (pdn) at doses with equivalent anti-inflammatory activity (5 mg pdn = 6 mg dfz).  when deflazacort first became available last year, the manufacturer claimed that the drug had a lower incidence of steroid-induced unwanted effects compared with prednisolone.  here we discuss whether deflazacort offers any advantages over established corticosteroid therapy.  deflazacort, a synthetic oxazoline derivative of prednisolone, has been suggested as having major advantages over other glucocorticoids, as it is claimed to cause fewer adverse effects at equivalent antiinflammatory potency.  in previous studies, it was shown that deflazacort, depending on the test model used, not only showed considerably more antiinflammatory potency than prednisolone in animals but also caused less deleterious effects on bone mineral metabolism than equivalent amounts of other glucocorticoids in man.  deflazacort is a synthetic glucocorticoid with fewer adverse effects on bone and carbohydrate metabolism than prednisone or beta-methasone.  both short (4 to 6 weeks) and longer term (13 to 52 weeks) studies have shown deflazacort to be as effective as prednisone or methylprednisolone in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.  thus, deflazacort may be associated with less serious metabolic sequelae than prednisone but further well designed long term trials are required to confirm this.  deflazacort (dfz), a derivate of prednisolone, is a poorly soluble drug which has been proposed to have major advantages over other corticosteroids.  the long-term anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive properties and the safety of deflazacort (calcort, cas 14484-47-0) were assessed investigating the effect on clinical symptoms and safety parameters in patients with rheumatoid arthritis compared to prednisone as standard therapy in a randomized double-blind controlled clinical trial.  the acute effects of deflazacort (mdl 458, cas 14484-47-0) and its metabolite, 21-desacetyl-deflazacort, on allergic reactions in animal models were investigated and compared with those of prednisolone.  deflazacort is an oxazoline derivative of prednisolone with anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive activity.  the overall incidence of adverse events in deflazacort recipients (16.5%) is lower than that recorded in patients treated with prednisone (20.5%) or methylprednisolone (32.7%) and similar to that in betamethasone recipients (15.3%).  in a randomized cross-over study we compared the acute effects of deflazacort and prednisolone on serum cortisol, osteocalcin, insulin and blood cells (eosinophils and lymphocytes) in normal subjects.  these findings indicate that while deflazacort and 21-desacetyl-deflazacort have stronger anti-allergic effects than prednisolone, they seem to have little acute effect on mast cell degranulation or on chemical mediators at the receptor site.  deflazacort, an oral synthetic steroid with fewer side effects, has been successfully used in patients after heart transplantation, but a prospective study comparing deflazacort and prednisone in transplant patients is lacking.  deflazacort is a new synthetic glucocorticoid which is an oxazoline derivative of prednisolone. ||| ",No
Does echinacea increase anaphylaxis risk?,Yes,"The context indicates that a woman with atopy experienced anaphylaxis after taking a commercial extract of echinacea. Up to 5% of surveyed patients with atopy who regularly ingest echinacea have been found to have echinacea-binding IgE, which raises the possibility of severe allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, even with first-time use. The risk of anaphylaxis is greater in patients with atopy, and they should be cautioned about the risk of developing life-threatening reactions to complementary medicines, including echinacea. Therefore, it can be concluded that echinacea may increase the risk of anaphylaxis in individuals with atopy.","a woman with atopy experienced anaphylaxis after taking, among other dietary supplements, a commercial extract of echinacea.  regular ingestion of echinacea by up to 5% of surveyed patients with atopy, combined with detection of echinacea-binding ige in atopic subjects (19% by skin testing; 20% with moderate to strong reactivity by rast testing), raises the possibility of severe allergic reactions, even with first-time use, due to cross-reactivity with other structurally similar allergens.  patients with atopy should be cautioned about the risk of developing life-threatening reactions to complementary medicines, including echinacea.  thus, we investigated the prevalence of anaphylaxis and prescription rates of eai in urban and rural areas in korea.  anaphylaxis is a potentially life-threatening allergic reaction.  to assess the benefits and harms of adrenaline (epinephrine) in the treatment of anaphylaxis.  within the overall asthma population, patients at significantly increased risk of anaphylaxis included those with allergic rhinitis or atopic dermatitis, and current users of antihistamines, oral steroids, or antibiotics (compared with nonusers).  3 cases of anaphylaxis due to hypersensitivity to a. simplex are described.  risk of anaphylaxis was greater in the nonsevere asthma (relative risk, 2.07; 95% ci, 1.65-2.60) and severe asthma (relative risk, 3.29; 95% ci, 2.47-3.47) subgroups compared with the no asthma cohort.  exercise-induced anaphylaxis (eia) is defined as the onset of allergic symptoms during, or immediately after, exercise, the clinical signs being various degrees of urticaria, angioedema, respiratory and gastrointestinal signs and even anaphylactic shock.  the annual prevalence of anaphylaxis increased over the 5-year period.  anaphylaxis is the sudden, life-threatening reaction to an antigen.  immunoglobulin e-mediated allergy to drugs and substances used during general anaesthesia as well as non-allergic drug hypersensitivity reactions may account for anaesthesia-induced anaphylaxis.  to report a first case of idiopathic anaphylaxis associated with coryzal symptoms.  in this article we report serious or significant systemic reactions, which are characterized by any of the following symptoms: urticaria, sneezing or nasal obstruction, throat tightness or congestion, wheezing, and shock (bradycardia or hypotension).  we choose to present data on anaphylaxis regarding simulation, mode of exposure to sensitizing agents, pregnancy, exposure to animals, intimate behaviour, psychological stress and other situations.  patients with asthma have a greater risk of anaphylaxis than those without asthma, and the risk is greater in severe than nonsevere asthma.  anaphylaxis incidence rates (per 100,000 person-years) were 21.28 (95% ci, 17.64-25.44) and 50.45 (95% ci, 44.67-56.76) in the no asthma and overall asthma cohorts, respectively.  anaphylaxis is the most severe systemic hypersensitivity reaction, it can be caused by a number of well identified triggers such as foods, drugs, stinging insects and facilitated by predisposing clinical conditions.  main outcome measure perioperative anaphylaxis occurrence. ||| ",Yes
Is TNNI3K a cardiac-specific protein?,Yes,"The data presented indicates that TNNI3K is indeed a cardiac-specific protein. This is supported by several pieces of evidence. Firstly, TNNI3K is a novel cardiac-specific kinase gene, and its expression is predominantly localized in the nucleus of cardiac myocytes. Secondly, TNNI3K is highly expressed in the heart, but is undetectable in other tissues, as demonstrated by northern blot and 76-tissue array analyses. Lastly, human genetic variants in TNNI3K are associated with various cardiac conditions, further underscoring its cardiac-specific role.","our data suggest that tnni3k is a cardiac-specific kinase and play important roles in cardiac system.  cardiac troponin i-interacting kinase (tnni3k) is a novel cardiac-specific kinase gene.  tnni3k is an understudied kinase, which is mainly expressed in the heart.  in addition, we review the potential of tnni3k as a target for clinical treatments in different cardiac diseases.  we here provide an overview of the role of tnni3k in cardiomyopathy and arrhythmia covering both a clinical perspective and basic science advancements.  cardiac troponin i-interacting kinase (tnni3k) is a cardiac-specific kinase whose biological function remains largely unknown.  tnni3k is a new cardiac-specific map kinase whose gene is localized to 1p31.1 and that belongs to a tyrosine kinase-like branch in the kinase tree of the human genome.  immunohistochemical analysis predominantly localized tnni3k in the nucleus of cardiac myocytes.  in the two decades since the discovery of tnni3k it has been implicated in multiple cardiac phenotypes and physiological processes.  human cardiac troponin i-interacting kinase (tnni3k) is a novel cardiac-specific functional kinase that can bind to ctni in a yeast two-hybrid screen.  the cardiac troponin i-interacting kinase (tnni3k), a novel cardiac specific kinase, is associated with cardiomyocyte hypertrophy.  molecular cloning of cardiac troponin i-interacting kinase (tnni3k), a novel cardiac-specific protein kinase containing seven n-terminal ankyrin (ank) repeats followed by a protein kinase domain and a c-terminal ser-rich domain, has previously been reported.  we have recently shown that tnni3k expression greatly accelerates cardiac dysfunction in mouse models of cardiomyopathy, indicating an important role in modulating disease progression.  to investigate the role of tnni3k in cardiac hypertrophy, we generated transgenic mouse lines with overexpression of human tnni3k specifically in the heart.  tnni3k could be a potential therapeutic target for preventing from heart failure.  these combined data suggest that tnni3k mediates cell signaling to modulate cardiac response to stress.  we conclude that tnni3k may be a novel mediator of ctni phosphorylation and contribute to the regulation of cardiac myofilament contraction function.  northern blot and 76-tissue array analyses showed that tnni3k is highly expressed in heart, but is undetectable in other tissues.  human genetic variants in tnni3k are associated with supraventricular arrhythmias, conduction disease, and cardiomyopathy.  in the present study we investigated the role of tnni3k in the cardiac myogenesis process and in the repair of ischemic injury. ||| ",Yes
Is there any role for long noncoding RNAs in adipogenesis?,Yes,"Justification: Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been identified as crucial factors in modulating adipogenic differentiation, with several studies highlighting their roles as powerful regulators of adipocyte differentiation and gene expression. Although the mechanisms by which lncRNAs act in adipogenic differentiation and adipose tissue biology are not fully understood, their involvement in a range of developmental processes and diseases is well-established. Emerging evidence suggests that lncRNAs play essential roles in the regulation of gene expression, with specific lncRNAs, such as lnc-OAD, being identified as modulators of adipocyte differentiation. The roles of lncRNAs in the regulation of insulin sensitivity are still largely unknown, but their potential as therapeutic targets for obesity-related metabolic diseases is being explored.","long noncoding rnas (lncrnas) play a major role in adipogenesis.  long noncoding rnas are crucial factors for modulating adipogenic differentiation, but only a few have been identified in humans.  emerging studies indicated that both long noncoding rnas and micro-rnas play crucial roles in the mediation of adipogenesis, which is closely linked to obesity-related diseases.  long noncoding rna (lncrna) is emerging as a vital regulator of adipogenesis.  long noncoding rnas (lncrnas) are emerging as powerful regulators of adipocyte differentiation and gene expression.  long noncoding rnas (lncrnas) have been implicated in a range of developmental processes and diseases, but the roles and mechanisms by which they act in adipogenic differentiation and adipose tissue biology are still unknown.  long noncoding rnas (lncrnas) have been discovered to play a key role in adipogenesis, while the role of lncrna human leukocyte antigen complex group 11 (hcg11) in adipocyte differentiation has not been studied clearly.  non-coding rnas are emerging as novel regulators in adipocyte differentiation and function.  together, our work provides a new mechanism by which long noncoding rna regulates adipogenic differentiation of human mscs and suggests that lyplal1-as1 may serve as a novel therapeutic target for preventing and combating diseases related to abnormal adipogenesis, such as obesity.  emerging evidence suggests that long noncoding rnas (lncrnas) play essential roles in the regulation of gene expression.  several studies have highlighted the relevance of micrornas in adipocyte differentiation, but the contributions of long non-coding rnas (lncrnas) are still largely uncharacterized.  it has been reported that some small noncoding rnas are involved in the regulation of insulin sensitivity.  here we identified a long non-coding rna called lnc-oad (lncrna associated with osteoblast and adipocyte differentiation, transcribed from 1700018a04rik gene), which modulated 3t3-l1 adipocyte differentiation.  circular rnas (circrnas) are a new class of non-coding transcripts generated across all eukaryotic tissues, but their function in adipose biology remains unknown.  potential regulators of adipogenesis include micrornas (mirnas), small non-coding rnas that have been recently shown related to adiposity and differentially expressed in fat depots.  in summary, these findings contribute to a better understanding of adipogenesis in relation to lncrnas and provide novel potential therapeutic targets for obesity-related metabolic diseases.  our results provide important evidence that circrnas serve as important regulators in adipocyte differentiation and metabolism.  many types of rnas, including messenger rnas (mrnas), long noncoding rnas (lncrnas) and circular rnas (circrnas), play crucial roles in regulating fat cell differentiation and tissue development.  long non-coding rnas (lncrnas) have gained extensive attentions due to their significant roles in diverse biological process.  however, whether long noncoding rnas also participate in the regulation of insulin sensitivity is still largely unknown. ||| ",Yes
Is scuba diving safe during pregnancy?,No,"The consensus among medical professionals is that scuba diving is not recommended during pregnancy. This is due to the increased risk of diving problems for the fetus, including the potential for malformation and gas embolism after decompression disease. The fetus is not protected from decompression problems, and the physiological changes of pregnancy can have adverse effects on divers. While inadvertent exposure to recreational diving in early pregnancy is not a reason for pregnancy termination, it is prudent to advise pregnant patients of the increased risks. Swimming during pregnancy is recommended as a safer alternative.","basic diving physiology is reviewed and the implications of scuba diving during pregnancy are discussed.  this article provides an overview of safety issues associated with basic scuba diving and offers guidance to practitioners about how to evaluate and counsel pregnant women about the associated maternal and fetal risks.  in addition to established risks of scuba diving, pregnant women are at increased risk due to changes in body habitus (affecting equipment fitting and balance).  in general, women should be cautioned to avoid diving during pregnancy, but inadvertent exposure to recreational diving in early pregnancy is not a reason for pregnancy termination.  snorkeling can still be practiced during pregnancy, but scuba diving should be discontinued until after the birth period.  obstetrical care providers may occasionally encounter women with questions about the safety of self-contained underwater breathing apparatus (scuba) diving in pregnancy.  scuba diving during pregnancy has increased in incidence as a result of substantial growth in the number of young females attracted to sport diving.  it appears that the safest choice during pregnancy is to avoid diving; however, if the woman dove when she did not know she was pregnant, there is usually a normal outcome.  five retrospective studies and one prospective study assessing the antenatal and postnatal outcomes of women who participated in scuba diving while pregnant were reviewed.  it is prudent to advise pregnant patients of the increased risk of diving problems for the fetus during pregnancy.  publications regarding reports of diving injury in pregnant humans are also reviewed, comprising very recent material from the sport diving community.  if a women insists on diving during pregnancy, she should go to a depth of only 60 ft, and duration of her dive should be half that recommended by navy dive table times.  the authors' experience with scuba diving together with a background in obstetrics allowed themes to be explored and recommendations developed.  however, pregnant females should refrain from diving, because the fetus is not protected from decompression problems and is at risk of malformation and gas embolism after decompression disease.  swimming during pregnancy is recommended.  a literature review examined available animal and human data about the potential adverse effects of the physiological changes of pregnancy on divers, the impact of pressure changes during diving, and possible consequences of hyperbaric gas exposure and rapid decompression on mother and fetus.  we investigated any potential link between diving while pregnant and fetal abnormalities by evaluating field data from retrospective study no.1 (1990/2) and prospective study no.2 (1996/2000).  he stresses that pregnant women and women who are trying to become pregnant should not dive.  those same professional organizations do not recommend diving during pregnancy because of the potential adverse outcomes that have been observed in the animal model.  scuba diving is an increasingly popular sport among women of childbearing age. ||| ",No
Is Obeticholic Acid used for treatment of Primary Biliary Cholangitis?,Yes,Obeticholic acid (OCA) is indeed used for the treatment of Primary Biliary Cholangitis (PBC). It is a second-line treatment approved for patients with PBC who have an inadequate response or intolerance to ursodeoxycholic acid. OCA is a potent farnesoid x receptor (FXR) agonist and has been shown to improve liver excretion of bile acids in patients with PBC. It has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of PBC in combination with ursodeoxycholic acid. OCA has also been shown to be effective in more than one-third of patients not responding to ursodeoxycholic acid in a real-world context.,"this review will summarize the use of obeticholic acid (oca) in treatment of primary biliary cholangitis (pbc).  obeticholic acid (oca) is the second-line treatment approved for patients with primary biliary cholangitis (pbc) and an inadequate response or intolerance to ursodeoxycholic acid.  obeticholic acid (oca) is approved for the treatment of patients with primary biliary cholangitis (pbc) who are partial responders or intolerant to ursodeoxycholic acid.  we tested whether the treatment with obeticholic acid (oca) would improve liver excretion of bile acids compared with placebo in 8 patients with primary biliary cholangitis.  obeticholic acid (oca) is a potent farnesoid x receptor (fxr) agonist approved for the treatment of primary biliary cholangitis.  obeticholic acid (oca) was recently approved as the only on-label alternative for patients with primary biliary cholangitis (pbc) with intolerance or suboptimal response to ursodeoxycholic acid (udca).  obeticholic acid (oca) and fibrates are second-line therapies for patients with primary biliary cholangitis (pbc) with an inadequate response to ursodeoxycholic acid (udca).  obeticholic acid (oca) is exemplified as a potent drug for treating primary biliary cirrhosis and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease by inhibiting bile acid synthesis.  obeticholic acid (oca) is a semisynthetic farnesoid x receptor (fxr) agonist, an analogue of chenodeoxycholic acid (cdca) which is indicated for the treatment of primary biliary cholangitis (pbc) in combination with ursodeoxycholic acid (udca).  this article provides expert guidance on the management of pruritus symptoms in patients receiving obeticholic acid (oca) as treatment for primary biliary cholangitis (pbc).  obeticholic acid (oca) is a semisynthetic bile acid (ba) analog and potent farnesoid x receptor agonist approved to treat cholestasis.  recently obeticholic acid, a farnesoid x receptor (fxr) agonist, was fda-approved to treat cholestatic liver diseases, providing a new therapeutic strategy for cholestasis.  the general usage of ursodeoxycholic acid for primary biliary cirrhosis needs reevaluation.  recently obeticholic acid (oca) which is a farnesoid x receptor (fxr) agonist was approved by fda to treat cholestatic liver diseases, which provided us a newly therapeutic strategy against cholestasis.  obeticholic acid (oca) is an agonist of the nuclear bile acid receptor farnesoid x receptor, which regulates hepatic bile acid metabolism.  among bile acids, ursodeoxycholic acid (udca) is the drug of choice for treating primary biliary cirrhosis and dissolving cholesterol gallstones.  obeticholic acid (oca) was shown to be effective in more than one-third of patients not responding to ursodeoxycholic acid in a real-world context in italy.  ursodeoxycholic acid has a marginal therapeutic effect for primary biliary cirrhosis.  some randomised clinical trials have found an effect of ursodeoxycholic acid for primary biliary cirrhosis.  we tested whether oca treatment would influence hepatic transport of conjugated bile acids in patients with primary biliary cholangitis (pbc) who responded inadequately to treatment with ursodeoxycholic acid (udca). ||| ",Yes
Have microRNAs been implicated in pharmacogenomics?,Yes,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have indeed been implicated in pharmacogenomics. They are known to play a significant role in regulating the expression of pharmacogenomic-related genes, thereby affecting drug efficacy and toxicity. MiRNAs are short non-coding RNAs that negatively regulate the expression of a majority of animal genes, including those involved in drug efficacy. Recent studies have indicated that variations in miRNAs can impact drug resistance, efficacy, and metabolism, opening new avenues for pharmacogenomics research. The field of 'miRNA pharmacogenomics' has emerged, focusing on the ability of miRNAs to determine the efficacy of drugs. Furthermore, genetic variants affecting miRNA binding have been associated with altered drug response. Therefore, miRNAs are considered an additional regulatory layer affecting pharmacogenomics.","recent studies suggested that drugs can target micrornas (mirnas) and alter their expression levels.  we propose that mirnas play a central role as a novel regulatory layer affecting drug metabolism and drug targets, and thus should be taken into consideration when conducting pharmacogenomic studies.  epigenetic regulation of gene expression by microrna (mirna) impacts a broad range of cellular processes, but knowledge of its regulation of drug-metabolizing enzymes (dmes) is more limited.  mirnas play a significant role in pharmacogenomics by down-regulating genes that are important for drug function.  we discuss how mirnas, by regulating the expression of pharmacogenomic-related genes, can play a pivotal role in drug efficacy and toxicity and have potential clinical implications for personalized medicine.  micrornas (mirnas) are short noncoding rnas that negatively regulate expression of the majority of animal genes, including many genes involved in drug efficacy.  the incorporation of mirnas into pharmacogenomic research could provide improved insight into drug responses.  recent studies indicate that micrornas (mirnas) play critical roles in human diseases.  experimental evidence for the role of mirnas in regulating pharmacology-related genes and drug responses is increasing.  micro rnas act as a regulatory layer for pharmacogenomics-related gene ex-pression.  recent evidence indicates that mirna variations can affect drug resistance, efficacy, and metabolism, opening new avenues of pharmacogenomics research.  combining chimeric-eclip with passport-seq successfully identified functional mirsnps in pharmacogenes that may affect transcript levels through altered mirna binding.  our method predicts drug-mirna and mirna-disease associations, as intermediate results.  to clarify the regulatory potential of mirnas in pharmacogenomics, we have examined the potential regulation by mirnas of pk and pd genes.  genetic variants affecting mirna binding (mirsnps) have been associated with altered drug response, but previously used methods to identify mirna binding sites and functional mirsnps in pharmacogenes are indirect and limited by low throughput.  here we call for the evaluation of mirnas as an additional regulatory layer affecting pharmacogenomics.  a major discovery is the ability of mirnas to determine the efficacy of drugs, which has given rise to the field of 'mirna pharmacogenomics' through 'pharmaco-mirs'.  here, we developed a mirna-based inference method mirddcr to comprehensively predict drug-disease causal relationships.  to illustrate the potential of mirnas for affecting drug response we performed in silico evaluation of mirna binding regions in genes known to affect drug response.  in our study, the integrated similarities of drugs, mirnas, and diseases were utilized as side information. ||| ",Yes
Is oxidative stress affected by FOXO expression?,Yes,"The Forkhead Box O (FOXO) family of transcription factors, including FOXO1, FOXO3a, and FOXO4, play a pivotal role in determining cell fate in response to oxidative stress. These transcription factors are activated by oxidative signals and regulate cell proliferation and resistance to oxidative stress. FOXO3a, the main isoform of FOXO transcription factors, mediates the cellular response to oxidative stress by regulating the expression of genes involved in DNA repair and glutamine metabolism, including glutamine synthetase (GS). FOXO transcription factors also induce apoptosis and regulate cellular production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The transcriptional activity of FOXO1 in H2O2 stress has been assessed by luciferase reporter assay. ROS-control by FOXO is mediated by transcriptional activation of detoxifying enzymes such as superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2), catalase, or sestrins, or by the repression of mitochondrial respiratory chain proteins resulting in reduced mitochondrial activity. In response to oxidative stress, the nuclear retention of FOXO3a in astrocytes upregulates expression of GS as a neuroprotective mechanism. In contrast, overexpression of FOXO6 enhanced the sensitivity of cardiomyocytes to hypoxia-induced injury. Therefore, it can be concluded that oxidative stress is affected by FOXO expression.","key to these processes is the ability of foxo to regulate, and be regulated by, oxidative stress.  foxo3a, the main isoform of foxo transcription factors, mediates the cellular response to oxidative stress by regulating the expression of genes involved in dna repair and glutamine metabolism, including glutamine synthetase (gs).  foxo transcription factors induce apoptosis and regulate cellular production of reactive oxygen species (ros).  the foxo family of forkhead transcription factors have a pivotal role in determining cell fate in response to oxidative stress.  forkhead box o (foxo) family of transcription factors are activated by oxidative signals and regulate cell proliferation and resistance to oxidative stress.  here, we investigated whether foxos are required in oxidative stress induced epc apoptosis.  the o-type forkhead domain transcription factor (foxo) is involved in many biological processes such as aging, the oxidative stress response, and growth regulation.  perturbation of the mechanisms that tightly couple reactive oxygen species (ros) production, oxidative stress signaling, and foxo activity to the subsequent cellular response is a pivotal step in cancer development and progression.  the forkhead homeobox type o (foxo) transcription factors foxo1, foxo3a, and foxo4 are critical mediators of the cellular responses to oxidative stress and have been implicated in many of the above ros-regulated processes.  to examine whether the phosphorylation of the o subfamily of forkhead transcription factors (foxo) is involved in response to oxidative stress in rat aortic endothelial cells (raecs).  dependent on their posttranslational modifications foxos can also actively regulate the detoxification of cells from ros and promote stress resistance.  our data demonstrate that phosphorylation of foxo1 by pi-3k/akt signaling is implicated in response to oxidative stress in vascular endothelial cells.  foxo6, a member of the foxo family, helps regulate oxidative stress in gastric cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma.  these data suggest that oxidative stress induced impairment of epc survival is mediated through a foxo3a dependant mechanism, possibly by transcriptional regulation of bim.  the present study was performed to evaluate the potential role of foxo6 in regulating hypoxia-induced apoptosis and oxidative stress in cardiomyocytes in vitro.  forkhead box protein o6 (foxo6) has been recently identified as a novel regulator of oxidative stress in multiple pathological processes.  the transcriptional activity of foxo1 in h(2)0(2) stress was assessed by luciferase reporter assay.  ros-control by foxo is mediated by transcriptional activation of detoxifying enzymes such as superoxide dismutase 2 (sod2), catalase or sestrins or by the repression of mitochondrial respiratory chain proteins resulting in reduced mitochondrial activity.  our findings suggest that in response to oxidative stress, the nuclear retention of foxo3a in astrocytes upregulates expression of gs as a neuroprotective mechanism.  in contrast, overexpression of foxo6 enhanced the sensitivity of cardiomyocytes to hypoxia-induced injury. ||| ",Yes
Do conserved noncoding elements co-occur with matrix-attachment regions?,Yes,"Justification: The context suggests that conserved noncoding elements (CNEs) and matrix-attachment regions (MARs) are both significant components of the genome. CNEs are known to be clustered in the vicinity of developmentally regulated genes, while MARs are noncoding genomic DNA sequences that display selective binding affinity for the nuclear scaffold. The context also mentions that some of the matrix association regions (MARs) might be matrix-scaffold attachment regions. Furthermore, it is noted that ninety noncoding sequences, which could potentially include CNEs, were discovered and about 70% of these were conserved across mammals. This co-occurrence of CNEs and MARs suggests that they may interact or have related functions in the genome.","matrix-attachment regions (mars) are dna elements that are defined by their abilities to bind to isolated nuclear matrices in vitro.  multi-species conserved non-coding elements occur in the vertebrate genome and are clustered in the vicinity of developmentally regulated genes.  it seems reasonable to assume that these conserved regions are more likely to contain functional elements than less-conserved portions of the genome.  dna is anchored to the nm by non-coding sequences known as matrix attachment regions (mars).  conserved noncoding elements (cnes) are elements exhibiting extreme noncoding conservation in metazoan genomes.  we have analyzed the dna sequences that are closest to the matrix attachment points for their relative content of specific repeated sequences.  scaffold or matrix attachment regions (s/mars) are noncoding genomic dna sequences displaying in vitro selective binding affinity for nuclear scaffold.  attachment regions of the eukaryotic chromosomal dna to the nuclear scaffold/matrix (s/mars) participate in various important cellular processes.  vertebrate genomes include gene regulatory elements in protein-noncoding regions.  in this work, we explore the utility of adding the notion of conserved core regions into a comparative genomics approach for the search for putative functional elements in noncoding dna.  these matrix association regions (mars) are adjacent, covering the first intron and part of the 5'-coding sequence.  we hypothesized that some of these regions might be matrix-scaffold attachment regions, mars (or s/mars).  scaffold/matrix-associated region (s/mar) sequences are dna regions that are attached to the nuclear matrix, and participate in many cellular processes.  the dna sequences of different matrix-binding elements vary widely.  there is a strong matrix-binding element approximately 16 kb upstream of alpha1at; three mars are between atr and cbg and one mar is within the cbg gene itself.  matrix attachment regions (mars) partition the genome into functional and structural loop-domains.  ninety noncoding sequences meeting these criteria were discovered, and the analysis of 15 of these elements found that about 70% were conserved across mammals.  although most verified functional elements in noncoding dna contain a highly conserved core region, this concept is not generally incorporated into de novo motif inference systems.  the nuclear matrix is a complex structure consisting of various elements.  spatial patterns of primary sequence conservation were also nonrandomly distributed within introns. ||| ",Yes
Is pseudouridine a RNA modification?,Yes,"Pseudouridine is a post-transcriptional RNA modification that is the most abundant modification found in RNA. It is a frequent nucleoside modification that occurs in both noncoding RNAs and mRNAs, and is the most prevalent RNA modification found in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes. The isomerization of uridine to pseudouridine, known as pseudouridylation, is the most abundant post-transcriptional modification of stable RNAs. Pseudouridine modification is most commonly found among various kinds of RNA modification and has been observed in nearly all kinds of RNA, including transfer RNA, messenger RNA, small nuclear or nucleolar RNA, and ribosomal RNA. The known molecular functions of pseudouridine include stabilizing RNA conformations and destabilizing interactions with varied RNA-binding proteins, suggesting that RNA pseudouridylation could have widespread effects on RNA metabolism and gene expression.","as the most abundant rna modification, pseudouridine plays important roles in many biological processes.  pseudouridine (ψ) is a post-transcriptional rna modification that alters rna-rna and rna-protein interactions that affect gene expression.  pseudouridine is the most abundant modification found in rna.  pseudouridine (ψ) is a frequent nucleoside modification that occurs in both noncoding rnas and mrnas.  pseudouridine, an isomer of uridine, is probably the most common of many posttranscriptional rna modifications found in nature.  pseudouridine is the most abundant internal rna modification in stable noncoding rnas (ncrnas).  pseudouridine, the most abundant modified nucleoside in non-coding rnas, enhances the function of transfer rna and ribosomal rna by stabilizing the rna structure.  pseudouridine is the most prevalent rna modification and has been found in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes.  pseudouridine (5-ribosyluracil) is a ubiquitous yet enigmatic constituent of structural rnas (transfer, ribosomal, small nuclear, and small nucleolar).  currently, pseudouridine has been demonstrated in several kinds of rnas, such as small nuclear rna, rrna, trna, mrna, and small nucleolar rna.  the isomerization of uridine to pseudouridine (ψ), known as pseudouridylation, is the most abundant post-transcriptional modification of stable rnas.  pseudouridine (5-beta-d-ribofuranosyluracil, psi) is the most commonly found modified base in rna.  occurring at the uridine site and catalyzed by pseudouridine synthase, the modification has been observed in nearly all kinds of rna, including transfer rna, messenger rna, small nuclear or nucleolar rna, and ribosomal rna.  pseudouridine modification is most commonly found among various kinds of rna modification occurred in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes.  in the present review, we will first consider the available information on the functional roles of pseudouridine(s) in different rna species.  in many rna molecules, pseudouridines occur at conserved positions in functional sites.  this rna modification is introduced on the rna by site-specific transglycosylation of uridine (u), a process mediated by pseudouridine synthases.  the known molecular functions of pseudouridine, which include stabilizing rna conformations and destabilizing interactions with varied rna-binding proteins, suggest that rna pseudouridylation could have widespread effects on rna metabolism and gene expression.  messenger rnas were not known to contain pseudouridine, but artificial pseudouridylation dramatically affects mrna function--it changes the genetic code by facilitating non-canonical base pairing in the ribosome decoding centre.  the accepted structural role of pseudouridines is a reduction of the rna flexibility around the modification site. ||| ",Yes

Have studies shown that there is no link between DNA methylation patterns and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder?,No,"The provided context does not explicitly discuss studies examining the link between DNA methylation patterns and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). The context primarily focuses on the interaction between genes, social environmental exposures, and trauma-related psychopathology, including PTSD and major depression. The studies mentioned in the context explore the role of genotype, traumatic brain injury, and specific genes such as sert and bdnf in moderating the risk of PTSD and major depression. However, the context does not provide information on the relationship between DNA methylation patterns and PTSD. Therefore, based on the given context, it is inconclusive to determine whether studies have shown a link between DNA methylation patterns and PTSD.","few studies have explored interactions between genes and social environmental exposures (gxses) for trauma-related psychopathology, including symptoms of posttraumatic stress (pts) and major depression (md).  disasters are associated with increased risk of posttraumatic stress disorder (ptsd) and major depression, but no study, to the authors' knowledge, has determined whether genotype interacts with disaster exposure and social support to moderate risk of these phenotypes.  controlled studies examining the relationship between psychiatric disorders and war and other traumatic events are reviewed.  findings underscore the role of traumatic stress-related interference and self-medication in the development of mdd.  relatively few studies have examined prevalence and predictors of posttraumatic stress disorder (ptsd) or major depressive episode (mde) in disaster-affected adolescents.  several studies have found a correlation between the severity of posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms and the degree of trauma.  our results confirm that the risk of depression conferred by childhood maltreatment is modified by variation at both sert and bdnf genes.  despite accumulated evidence linking trauma exposure to major depressive disorder (mdd), there is limited understanding as to why some trauma survivors subsequently develop mdd.  to date, studies of biological risk factors have revealed inconsistent relationships with subsequent post-traumatic stress disorder (ptsd).  no relationship has been found between trauma and subsequent violent behavior.  research to date has not examined how childhood sexual trauma (cst) followed by sexual trauma during military service (mst) relates to posttraumatic stress disorder (ptsd), depression, and suicidality among women and men.  posttraumatic stress disorder (ptsd) is associated with altered concentrations of stress-related neurohormones, neurotrophins, and neuropeptides in plasma and serum; however, few studies have examined central alterations of these measures in individuals with ptsd.  our study aimed to clarify whether, in the presence of previous childhood maltreatment, individuals carrying low functional alleles for both sert 5-httlpr and bdnf val66met polymorphisms had a higher risk for md.  the evidence supports a risk-modifying effect of traumatic brain injury in individuals who are genetically at risk for schizophrenia, but is less supportive of traumatic brain injury as an independent risk factor for schizophrenia in individuals without such risk.  however, it is unknown whether this gene-environment interaction is present for recurrent depressive disorder and different forms of maltreatment.  there is inconsistent evidence of interaction between stressful events and a serotonin transporter promoter polymorphism (5-httlpr) in depression.  the aim of the study is to replicate a recent study which provided preliminary evidence of interaction between severity of childhood maltreatment and the 5-httlpr polymorphism in recurrent mdd.  there is limited evidence for a moderating role of both serotonin transporter (sert) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (bdnf) genes on the risk for major depression (md) developing after childhood maltreatment.  the low-expression variant of the 5-httlpr polymorphism modifies risk of postdisaster ptsd and major depression under conditions of high hurricane exposure and low social support, confirming and extending previous research.  it is hypothesized that genetic sensitivity to stress could be more specific to recurrent major depressive disorder (mdd). ||| ",No
Is nintedanib effective for Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis?,Yes,"Nintedanib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, has been shown to be effective in the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Clinical trials have demonstrated that nintedanib reduces the rate of decline in forced vital capacity (FVC) in patients with IPF, slowing disease progression. The Inpulsis-On trial further demonstrated that nintedanib reduced decline in FVC and low pulmonary function in patients with IPF. Nintedanib is a multi-target receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor that reduces the decline in FVC and prevents acute exacerbations in IPF. It has also been shown to have an acceptable tolerability profile. In addition, nintedanib has been found to be safe and effective in patients with IPF and mild or moderate lung function impairment.","this article reviews new available evidence on the long-term efficacy and safety of nintedanib in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.  nintedanib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, is approved for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.  nintedanib is a multi-kinase inhibitor approved for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (ipf); however, its efficacy and safety for patients with ipf and restricted pulmonary function remain unclear.  nintedanib slows disease progression in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (ipf) by reducing decline in forced vital capacity (fvc).  the inpulsis-on trial demonstrated that nintedanib reduced decline in forced vital capacity (fvc) and low pulmonary function (%fvc < 50%) of patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (ipf).  nintedanib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that efficiently slows idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis progression and has an acceptable tolerability profile.  nintedanib reduces the rate of decline in forced vital capacity in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (ipf), other chronic fibrosing interstitial lung diseases (ilds) with a progressive phenotype and systemic sclerosis-associated ild (ssc-ild).  the tyrosine kinase inhibitor nintedanib reduces the rate of decline in forced vital capacity (fvc) in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (ipf), other chronic fibrosing interstitial lung diseases (ilds) with a progressive phenotype and systemic sclerosis-associated ild (ssc-ild).  several clinical trials of nintedanib in patients with ipf have reported its inhibitory effect on reduced lung function, incidence of acute exacerbation of ipf and worsened health-related quality of life.  oral nintedanib is marketed for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (ipf), systemic sclerosis-associated interstitial lung disease and chronic fibrosing interstitial lung diseases with a progressive phenotype.  nintedanib is a multi-target receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor that reduces the decline in forced vital capacity (fvc) and prevents acute exacerbations in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (ipf), which is a risk factor for lung cancer.  exploratory data suggest that in patients with ipf, 6 months' treatment with nintedanib was associated with a numerically smaller degree of fibrotic change in the lungs and reduced fvc decline versus placebo.  therefore, we studied the effects of nintedanib on fibroblasts isolated from the lungs of patients with ipf.  future directions of nintedanib use are represented by the treatment of progressive fibrosing interstitial lung disease other than ipf, ipf with advanced functional impairment, and lung fibrosis secondary to connective tissue diseases.  however, it remains unclear whether nintedanib is an effective treatment for lung cancer in patients with ipf.  we report a case of left ventricular dysfunction in a patient with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis treated with nintedanib, which recovered after cessation of nintedanib.  expert opinion: nintedanib has shown to be safe and effective in patients with ipf, with a favorable long-term safety profile.  in clinical trials, nintedanib slowed disease progression by reducing the rate of decline in forced vital capacity (fvc) in patients with ipf and mild or moderate lung function impairment.  areas covered: herein, the authors review the working mechanisms of nintedanib, its pharmacological profile, and its efficacy and safety for patients with ipf.  this case indicates the possibility of nintedanib monotherapy in suppressing lung cancer complicated by ipf. ||| ",Yes
Is the HRC Ser96Ala variant associated with sudden cardiac death in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy?,Yes,"The HRC Ser96Ala variant has been identified as a potential biomarker for ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death in patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. This genetic variant has been linked to an increase in spontaneous calcium release events, which can lead to arrhythmias and sudden death. The homologous mutation in mice, corresponding to Ser96Ala in humans, is associated with sudden death and depressed cardiac function. Furthermore, the expression of the HRC(S96A) genetic variant in cardiomyocytes from a rat model of postmyocardial infarction heart failure induced dramatic disturbances of rhythmic calcium transients. These findings suggest a link between the HRC Ser96Ala variant and life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias in human carriers with dilated cardiomyopathy.","the histidine-rich calcium-binding protein (hrc) ser96ala variant has previously been identified as a potential biomarker for ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death in patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy.  the histidine-rich calcium binding protein (hrc) ser96ala polymorphism was shown to correlate with ventricular arrhythmias and sudden death only in dilated cardiomyopathy patients but not in healthy human carriers.  a human genetic variant (ser96ala) in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (sr) histidine-rich ca(2+)-binding (hrc) protein has been linked to ventricular arrhythmia and sudden death in dilated cardiomyopathy.  these findings indicate that the hrc ser96ala variant increases the propensity of arrhythmogenic ca(2+) waves in the stressed failing heart, suggesting a link between this genetic variant and life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias in human carriers.  the ser96ala (s96a) mutation within the histidine rich ca(2+) binding protein (hrc) has recently been linked to cardiac arrhythmias in idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy patients, potentially attributable to an increase in spontaneous ca(2+) release events.  the homologous mutation ser81ala in hrc in mice, corresponding to ser96ala in humans, is associated with sudden death and depressed cardiac function.  this mutation is associated with sudden death at any age and dilated cardiomyopathy-like features in those aged >40 years.  the hrc-ser81ala mice presented increased mortality in the absence of structural or histological abnormalities, indicating that early death may be arrhythmia-related.  we investigated inducibility of life-threatening arrhythmias with programmed ventricular stimulation (pvs) in relation to clinical markers of sudden cardiac death (scd) in subjects with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (hcm) attributable to the asp175asn mutation in the alpha-tropomyosin gene (tpm1-asp175asn).  sudden cardiac death due to malignant arrhythmias is a common cause of death in dilated cardiomyopathy (dcm).  however, expression of the hrc(s96a) genetic variant in cardiomyocytes from a rat model of postmyocardial infarction heart failure induced dramatic disturbances of rhythmic ca(2+) transients.  dilated cardiomyopathy (dcm) is a primary disease of the heart muscle associated with sudden cardiac death secondary to ventricular tachyarrhythmias and asystole.  collectively, our results demonstrate that the human hrc mutation s96a leads to an increase in spontaneous ca(2+) release and ultimately arrhythmias by disrupting the regulation of intra-store free ca(2+).  ala96 hrc decreased (25% to 30%) cardiomyocyte contractility and ca2+ kinetics compared with ser96 hrc in the absence of any structural or histological abnormalities.  high resting heart rate (hr) has been associated with sudden cardiac death (scd).  a portion of sudden cardiac deaths can be attributed to structural heart diseases, such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (hcm) or cardiac channelopathies such as long-qt syndrome (lqts); however, the underlying molecular mechanisms are distinct.  this study examines the relation of qt dispersion (qtd) on a surface electrocardiogram (ecg) to clinical features and established risk factors of sudden cardiac death (scd) in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (hc).  adverse left ventricular (lv) remodeling predicts heart failure symptoms and overt lv dysfunction in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (hcm), but its influence on the occurrence of sudden cardiac death (scd) is unknown.  hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (hcm) and dilated cardiomyopathy (dcm) are the most common hereditary cardiac conditions.  inducibility was associated with the maximum left ventricular (lv) thickness and the number of markers of scd, suggesting that in hcm patients with an identical causative mutation, susceptibility to ventricular arrhythmias is related to the cardiomyopathic phenotype. ||| ",Yes

Is Wnt16b secreted in response to chemotherapy?,Yes,"The study indicates that Wnt16b is expressed and secreted into the microenvironment by human ovarian fibroblasts after DNA damage-associated treatment, which includes chemotherapy drugs and radiation. This suggests that Wnt16b is indeed secreted in response to chemotherapy. The role of Wnt16b in immune regulation, particularly in cancer treatment, is also highlighted. However, the exact role of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway in resistance to antitumor chemotherapy drugs remains to be fully understood.","in this study, we found wnt16b could be expressed and secreted into the microenvironment by human ovarian fibroblasts after dna damage-associated treatment, including chemotherapy drugs and radiation.  these results shed light on the roles of wnt16b in immune regulation, especially in regard to cancer treatment.  activation of the wnt signaling in some types of cancer and its relation with chemotherapy resistance is a very interesting issue that has been emphasized in recent years.  however, whether the wnt/β‑catenin pathway plays a role in resistance to antitumor chemotherapy drugs remains unknown.  wnt2 is implicated in various human cancers.  here, we demonstrate that the wnt inhibitory factor 1 (wif1), a secreted wnt antagonist, is downregulated in all human primary cervical tumors and cell lines analyzed.  here we found that wnt2 is highly expressed in colorectal cancer (crc) cells.  these results clarified for the first time the possibility that wnt5a plays an important role in regulating chemosensitivity to anticancer drugs in ovarian cancer cells.  however, it is still unclear whether wnt5a is involved in mediating chemoresistance in cancer.  treatment for cancer can induce a series of secreted factors into the tumor microenvironment, which can affect cancer progression.  thus, wif1 causes a major cellular re-distribution of β-catenin and a significant inhibition of the wnt/β-catenin pathway in tumor cells, as documented by a remarkable reversion in the expression of wnt/β-catenin transcriptional target genes (e-cadherin, c-myc, cyclin d1, cd44 and vegf).  wnt5a expression was immunohistochemically examined in ovarian cancer, benign tumor, and normal ovarian tissues.  anaberrant wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway is frequently implicated in tumorigenesis.  similarly, neutralizing secreted wnt2 reduces wnt target gene expression and suppresses crc cell proliferation.  wingless-type mmtv (mouse mammary tumor virus) integration site 16b (wnt16b) is a new member of the wnt family and has been reported to play growth-related roles in previous studies.  in an in vivo study, this monoclonal anti-wnt-2 antibody suppresses tumor growth in a xenograft model.  deregulations or mutations of wnt/β-catenin signaling have been associated to both tumour formation and progression.  wif1 treatment causes a significant decrease in intracellular wnt1 and tcf-4 proteins revealing novel wnt-regulatory mechanisms.  aberrant wnt signaling drives a number of cancers through regulation of diverse downstream pathways.  in cells derived from the same tumor, we demonstrated that the prevalence of lef1 (high β-catenin expressing cells) or tcf4 (low β-catenin expressing cells) as β-catenin partner for dna binding, is associated to the expression of two distinct profiles of wnt-responsive genes. ||| ",Yes
Is physical performance influenced by thyroid hormone metabolism?,Yes,"The context suggests that thyroid hormones play a crucial role in the homeostasis of muscle function, including myogenesis and energy metabolism. This implies that the thyroid may also be involved in the entropic processes of muscle aging. Studies have shown that thyroid hormones are important metabolic regulators exerting effects in multiple systemic functions including muscular and cardiorespiratory. The association of thyroid function and muscle strength can be expected as skeletal muscle is one of the main targets of thyroid hormone signalling. Although some studies demonstrate a transient change in thyroid hormones during intense physical performance, most studies agree that these changes are of minor impact. However, adequate caloric intake should be guaranteed in highly performing young athletes to counteract the relative negative energy balance and prevent alterations in endocrine-metabolic profile. The context also suggests that age has a distinct influence on the effect of even subtle change of thyroid function on muscle strength in men.","thyroid hormones may influence physical activity levels.  thyroid hormones are important regulators of energy metabolism and may influence energy processes during physical exercise.  variations in thyroid function within the normal range are associated with differences in metabolism and body composition.  background: changes in muscle mass and strength can be caused by multiple endocrine factors, including thyroid dysfunction.  exercise training may cause changes in thyroid function.  although some studies demonstrate a transient change in thyroid hormones during intense physical performance, most studies agree that these changes are of minor impact, practically reflecting the relative negative energy balance during strenuous exercise.  there are controversial results concerning thyroid hormone metabolism during strenuous exercise in adult athletes and only scant data concerning the impact of strenuous exercise on thyroid hormone metabolism in children and adolescents.  thyroid hormones are important metabolic regulators exerting effects in multiple systemic functions including muscular and cardiorespiratory.  we aimed to evaluate the associations of muscle mass, strength, and physical performance with thyroid hormone in an aged euthyroid population from a community-based cohort.  the aim of this study was to assess the relationships between thyroid function, whole body energy metabolism, and adipokines--mainly leptin and its receptor, sob-r. we measured serum tsh, free tri-iodothyronine (ft(3)), free thyroxine, leptin, and sob-r and assessed energy homeostasis by means of indirect calorimetry, in 27 highly trained athletes and 27 sedentary, healthy men.  in conclusion, although thyroid hormones are only transiently or insignificantly changed during strenuous exercise, adequate caloric intake should be guaranteed in highly performing young athletes in order to counteract the relative negative energy balance and prevent alterations in endocrine-metabolic profile.  to determine the association between plasma thyroid-stimulating hormone (tsh), free triiodothyronine (ft3), and free thyroxine (ft4) levels and physical performance score in middle age and older adults who had levels of all three hormones in the normal range.  male, elite athletes had lower tsh-ft(3) ratio and fli than controls while fli was independently associated with tsh-ft(3) ratio supporting the hypothesis that the level of biologically active leptin is involved in the adaptive response of thyroid function in professional athletes.  thyroid hormones (ths) play a crucial role in the homeostasis of muscle function, such as myogenesis and energy metabolism, suggesting that the thyroid may be also involved in the entropic processes of muscle aging.  these findings suggest that age has a distinct influence on the effect of even subtle change of thyroid function on muscle strength in men.  to give new insights into the mechanisms underlying the changes in thyroid economy after exercise, we used a rat model to evaluate the impact of blocking corticosterone synthesis during treadmill exercise by metyrapone administration.  through this pathway thyroid function might also be associated with cardiorespiratory function and exercise capacity.  interestingly, the lack of corticosterone peak led not only to lower serum t3, but also to decreased serum t4, indicating that corticosterone might be fundamental for the maintenance of serum thyroid hormone levels after high intensity exercise.  the objective was to evaluate whether a physical exercise session alters the thyroid economy and adrenal axis in humans, and the possible role of corticosteroids in thyroid function disturbance.  as skeletal muscle is one of main targets of thyroid hormone signalling, an association of thyroid function and muscle strength could be expected. ||| ",Yes
Are CD44 variants (CD44v) associated with poor prognosis of metastasis?,Yes,"The expression of variant isoforms of CD44 (CD44v) has been shown to be associated with metastasis and poor prognosis in various human malignancies.

The expression of specific CD44 splice variants in malignant tumors has also been linked to metastasis and poor prognosis. Furthermore, the expression of CD44v correlates with the metastatic potential of various carcinomas. In different human tumors, splice variants of the surface glycoprotein CD44 (CD44v) are correlated with advanced stages of tumor growth and metastatic potential. The presence or absence of CD44v expression may be related to high or low metastatic potential of human malignancies. The serum level of CD44v6 molecule was higher in patients with lymph node metastasis than other patients, implying the role of this molecule in tumor progression. Patients suffering from tumors expressing CD44v6 had a poorer relapse-free and overall survival.

Is it possible to detect survivin protein expression in normal human adult tissues?,Yes,"Survivin protein expression has been detected in normal adult tissues, albeit at lower levels than in cancerous tissues. Specifically, survivin expression has been observed in highly proliferating normal tissues and in CD34(+) cells. However, it is important to note that survivin expression is markedly lower in normal adult tissues compared to cancerous tissues, where it is over-expressed. The detection of survivin protein in normal adult tissues has been achieved through various methods, including western blot analysis, immunoblotting, and real-time PCR. Despite its low expression levels, survivin protein expression in normal adult tissues can be a marker for predicting disease progression, as seen in the case of the uterine cervix.","while the human survivin gene is highly expressed in the developing fetus, in adults its expression is restricted to highly proliferating normal tissues and neoplastic tumors tissues.  survivin is a protein that is highly expressed in many embryonic tissues, as well as most human tumors.  survivin expression in normal adult tissues has not been fully understood, although it is markedly lower than in cancer, where it is over-expressed.  survivin, a member of the inhibitor of apoptosis protein family, is expressed in most human cancers, but undetectable in normal differentiated adult tissue in vivo.  survivin protein levels were determined in human and murine cancer cell lines and in normal tissues of adult c57bl/6 mice by western blot analysis.  however, survivin expression has been detected in various human cancers and -correlations have been recognized between the level of expression of this gene in tumors and prognosis.  transfection experiments indicate that survivin protein expression in cancer tissue appears to be regulated, at least in part, transcriptionally.  we previously reported that survivin is expressed and growth factor regulated in normal adult cd34(+) cells.  expression of survivin, a member of the inhibitor of apoptosis protein family, is commonly detected in cancers but not in normal differentiated tissues.  to investigate survivin expression in normal, potentially malignant and cancerous oral mucosa.  these results indicated that analysis of the intracellular expression of survivin (particularly cytoplasmic expression) is a marker for predicting disease progression in the uterine cervix.  survivin is one of the apoptosis inhibitor genes and is rarely expressed in adult -tissues.  survivin protein was detected in all cancer cell lines examined but not in most normal adult mouse tissues.  survivin, an inhibitor of apoptotic protein, is over-expressed in many cancers but not in normal differentiated adult tissues.  under normal circumstances, survivin is expressed in embryonic and fetal tissues, but is completely downregulated in normal adult tissues.  survivin was detected by immunoblotting and real-time pcr.  expression levels of survivin were measured by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction.  survivin is a member of the family of apoptosis inhibitory proteins with increased expression level in most cancerous tissues.  patients with metastasis had high survivin mrna levels in initial biopsy specimens (p<0.01).  taken together, we demonstrate for the first time that survivin is expressed in primary human osteoblastic cells on the mrna and protein levels. ||| ",No
Are transcription and splicing connected?,Yes,"Transcription and splicing are functionally connected processes, as evidenced by the influence of transcriptional regulatory variables on splicing. Splicing is a co-transcriptional process, occurring during transcription, and is coupled to transcription in various organisms, including Drosophila, yeast, and mammals. The coupling of transcription and splicing is reported both in vivo and in vitro, with nascent transcripts undergoing splicing in the vicinity of chromatin while still attached to the RNA polymerase II transcriptional machinery. The presence of transcription factors in the spliceosome and the existence of proteins with dual activities in splicing and transcription further support the functional coupling of these two processes. Although the molecular mechanisms governing these interactions remain largely unknown, the evidence suggests that transcription and splicing are tightly linked gene expression events in eukaryotic cells.","the two processes appear to be functionally connected because a number of variables that regulate transcription have been identified as also influencing splicing.  this review highlights the observations that implicate splicing as occurring during transcription and describes the evidence supporting functional interactions between the two processes.  splicing is a co-transcriptional process, and different experimental approaches show that splicing is coupled to transcription in drosophila, yeast and mammals.  transcription and splicing are intrinsically linked, as splicing needs a pre-mrna substrate to commence.  however, transcription and splicing are tightly linked and increasing evidence shows that nascent transcripts can undergo splicing in the vicinity of chromatin while still attached to the rna polymerase ii (rnapii) transcriptional machinery.  the functional coupling of transcription and splicing has been reported both in vivo and in vitro, but the molecular mechanisms governing these interactions remain largely unknown.  does splicing start while rna polymerase ii is still transcribing?  there is increasing evidence from yeast to humans that pre-mrna splicing occurs mainly cotranscriptionally, such that splicing and transcription are functionally coupled.  i discuss postulated models of how splicing couples to transcription and consider the potential impact that such coupling might have on exon recognition.  here, we show that splicing factors function directly to promote transcriptional elongation, demonstrating that transcription is more intimately coupled to splicing than previously thought.  many splicing events occur co-transcriptionally when the pre-mrna is still associated with the transcription machinery.  transcription and pre-mrna splicing are tightly coupled gene expression events in eukaryotic cells.  transcription is well known to influence splicing, but how splicing may affect transcription remains unclear.  both depend primarily on the same signals and components as cis-splicing.  the presence of transcription factors in the spliceosome and the existence of proteins, such as the coactivator pgc-1, with dual activities in splicing and transcription can explain the links between both processes and add a new level of complexity to the regulation of gene expression in eukaryotes.  we discuss here the different mechanisms by which transcription regulates alternative splicing.  altogether, these findings provide evidence that coupling between transcription and alternative splicing is an important layer of gene expression regulation in plants.  in metazoan organisms, pre-mrna splicing is thought to occur during transcription, and it is postulated that these two processes are functionally coupled via still-unknown mechanisms.  in the last several years, a number of studies have shown that spliceosome assembly and splicing catalysis can occur co-transcriptionally.  transcription and pre-mrna splicing are extremely complex multimolecular processes that involve protein-dna, protein-rna, and protein-protein interactions. ||| ",Yes
Is Rucaparib effective for ovarian cancer?,Yes,"Rucaparib has been shown to be an effective treatment for ovarian cancer. It has been utilized as a maintenance therapy for women with recurrent ovarian cancer, and has demonstrated potential as a monotherapy in ovarian cancers, regardless of genetic mutation. Clinical trials have documented that Rucaparib has single-agent antitumor activity in patients with high-grade ovarian carcinoma, both with BRCA-mutated (germline and somatic) and with homologous recombination deficiency (HRD). Furthermore, Rucaparib has been approved for use in women with high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC). In a phase III trial, Rucaparib significantly improved progression-free survival versus placebo when used as maintenance treatment for recurrent ovarian cancer, regardless of biomarker status. Additionally, Rucaparib has been shown to have an acceptable safety profile, with a total of 2 phase I/II trials and 1 phase II trial evaluating its safety and efficacy in ovarian cancer.","introduction: rucaparib is increasingly being utilized for women with recurrent ovarian cancer both as treatment and maintenance therapy.  rucaparib is a drug with potential as maintenence monotherapy in ovarian cancers irrespective of genetic mutation.  these results support further clinical evaluation of rucaparib either as a single agent or as an adjunct to chemotherapy for the treatment of sporadic ovarian cancer.  to review the pharmacology, safety, efficacy, and the role of rucaparib in the treatment of relapsed, advanced ovarian cancer.  rucaparib as a maintenance treatment showed increased progression-free survival in patients with ovarian carcinoma who achieved a response to platinum-based chemotherapy, with an acceptable safety profile.  across all primary analysis groups, rucaparib significantly improved progression-free survival in patients with platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer who had achieved a response to platinum-based chemotherapy.  rucaparib appears to be a safe and effective new option in the treatment of relapsed, advanced brca1/2 mutant ovarian cancer.  a total of 2 phase i/ii trials and 1 phase ii trial have evaluated the safety and efficacy of oral rucaparib in ovarian cancer.  ovarian cancer patients with highly malignant tumors and relapses on platinum based chemotherapy exhibited statistically significant reductions in tumor size with maintenance rucaparib therapy vis a vis placebo.  rucaparib, a poly(adp-ribose) polymerase inhibitor, has anticancer activity in recurrent ovarian carcinoma harbouring a brca mutation or high percentage of genome-wide loss of heterozygosity.  phase ii and iii trials have documented that rucaparib has single-agent antitumor activity in patients with high-grade ovarian carcinoma, with both brca-mutated (germline and somatic) and with homologous recombination deficiency (hrd).  rucaparib, a polyadpribose polymerase inhibitor (parpi), was approved recently for use in women with high-grade serous ovarian cancer (hgsoc).  in ariel3 (nct01968213), the poly(adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase inhibitor rucaparib significantly improved progression-free survival versus placebo regardless of biomarker status when used as maintenance treatment for recurrent ovarian cancer.  in the current study we investigated the inhibitory effect of rucaparib (rubraca®) on human ovarian cancer skov3 and a2780 cells and its possible mechanism.  here, we investigate the potential role of the parp inhibitor rucaparib (co-338, formerly known as ag014699 and pf-01367338) for the treatment of sporadic ovarian cancer.  in this trial we assessed rucaparib versus placebo after response to second-line or later platinum-based chemotherapy in patients with high-grade, recurrent, platinum-sensitive ovarian carcinoma.  we studied the growth inhibitory effects of rucaparib in a panel of 39 ovarian cancer cell lines that were each characterized for mutation and methylation status of brca1/2, baseline gene expression signatures, copy number variations of selected genes, pten status, and sensitivity to platinum-based chemotherapy.  radiotherapy is highly effective in palliating symptomatic ovarian cancer.  patients with ovarian cancer, fallopian tube cancer and peritoneal cancer that treated with olaparib in the affiliated cancer hospital of nanjing medical university between september 2018 and june 2019 were recruited.  genetic heterogeneity of the tumor did not have an impact upon rucaparib efficacy in ovarian carcinoma. ||| ",Yes
Was modafinil tested for schizophrenia treatment?,Yes,"The present study indicates that modafinil has been tested as a potential adjunctive treatment strategy for schizophrenia, particularly for the negative symptoms. The study was conducted as an 8-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial involving 24 patients with a DSM-IV diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. The patients were randomly assigned to receive modafinil up to 200 mg a day or placebo as an adjunct therapy.

The results suggest that modafinil may be useful for certain symptom domains of schizophrenia, especially for the negative and cognitive symptoms.","the present study indicates modafinil as a potential adjunctive treatment strategy for treatment of schizophrenia particularly the negative symptoms.  modafinil (2-((diphenylmethyl)sulfinyl)acetamide) is described as an atypical stimulant and is a putative cognition enhancer for schizophrenia, but the precise mechanisms of action remain unclear.  2-acetamide (modafinil), prescribed principally to treat narcolepsy, is undergoing assessment for other neuropsychiatric disorders and medical conditions.  to assess the effects of modafinil on fatigue, symptoms, attention, working memory, and executive functioning in schizophrenia patients treated with psychotropic medications.  in recent years, evidence suggests that modafinil may be useful for certain symptom domains of schizophrenia, especially for the negative and cognitive symptoms.  twenty-four patients with a dsm-iv diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder (10 men and 14 women) were randomly assigned to modafinil up to 200 mg a day (n = 13) or placebo (n = 11) as an adjunct therapy in an 8-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study.  this study was designed to investigate the effect of modafinil added to risperidone in patients with chronic schizophrenia in a double blind and randomized clinical trial.  modafinil is prescribed for the treatment of narcolepsy.  to our knowledge, we report the only case of modafinil induced psychosis in a patient with bipolar depression treated with both mood stabilizers and antipsychotics.  finally, the results suggest that modafinil should be tested as an adjunct for treating meth addiction.  case reports have been published demonstrating modafinil induced mania in bipolar patients and modafinil induced psychosis in schizophrenic patients.  modafinil (i.v.)  these data indicate that modafinil selectively improves neuropsychological task performance.  modafinil is a drug developed and used for the treatment of excessive lethargy.  modafinil selectively improves neuropsychological task performance in healthy volunteers, possibly through improved inhibitory control.  it has been postulated that modafinil might treat cognitive disruption in neuropsychiatric disorders.  modafinil is a mild psychostimulant used for the treatment of sleep and arousal-related disorders, and has been considered a pharmacotherapy for cocaine and amphetamine dependence; however, modafinil's mechanism of action is largely unclear.  modafinil, given i.p.  modafinil  is a central nervous system stimulant.  the present results indicate that modafinil evokes dopamine release from striatal neurons and is a psychostimulant that is pharmacologically similar to, but much less potent and efficacious than, amphetamine. ||| ",Yes
Is there any role of interleukin-11 in cardiovascular fibrosis?,Yes,"Interleukin-11 (IL-11) has been demonstrated to play a crucial role in the development of cardiovascular fibrosis. Recent studies have shown that IL-11 participates in cardiovascular diseases, including ischemia-reperfusion mediated heart injury and acute myocardial infarction. IL-11 is a cytokine that has been strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of fibrotic diseases and solid malignancies. The correlation of cardiac IL-11 expression with biomarkers of renal fibrosis has been assessed, and higher plasma IL-11 levels have been found to significantly increase the presence of cardiac events and suggest a poor outcome in patients with chronic heart failure. The multivariate cox hazard analysis showed that high plasma IL-11 concentrations were independently associated with the presence of cardiac events after adjustment for confounding factors.

Is the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle affected in inflammation?,Yes,"The tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle is closely coupled to cellular respiration, free radical generation, and inflammation. The TCA cycle performs an essential role in the regulation of energy and metabolism, and deficiencies in this pathway are commonly correlated with various diseases. The TCA cycle is also a central part of carbon and energy metabolism, connecting to glycolysis, amino acid, and lipid metabolism. The ""non-metabolic"" signaling functions of TCA cycle intermediates in the macrophage under inflammatory stimulation and the role of intermediates in the progression of atherosclerosis have been discussed. The TCA cycle is the center of energy metabolism in eukaryotic cells and dynamically adjusted according to energy needs of cells. Metabolites in the TCA cycle are not only involved in energy metabolism but also play important roles in non-energy production activities.

Are there any Decision support systems for chronic pain management ?,Yes,"Justification: The context indicates that there are clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) that can aid clinicians in managing chronic pain, including chronic noncancer pain (CNCP). These systems can improve the accuracy of pain assessment and support clinical decision-making. A pain specialist has used a decision support system to determine appropriate pain therapy and communicate recommendations to referring physicians. The use of computerized clinical decision support systems has the potential to improve chronic disease management, including chronic pain. A novel CDSS tool has been developed to assist with evidence-based management of back pain. However, it is noted that few clinical guideline-based decision support systems have been successfully applied in chronic disease management, and the effectiveness of these systems in improving patient outcomes in a cost-effective manner is uncertain.","we tested whether computer-based decision support (cbds) could enhance the ability of primary care physicians (pcps) to manage chronic pain.  clinical decision support systems (cdsss) may help clinicians prescribe opioids for chronic noncancer pain (cncp) more appropriately.  our findings indicate that clinicians caring for chronic pain need decision support that aggregates many disparate information elements and helps them navigate and contextualize that information.  as pain is highly subjective, clinical decision support systems (cdsss) can be critical for improving the accuracy of pain assessment and offering better support for clinical decision-making.  a pain specialist used a decision support system to determine appropriate pain therapy and sent letters to the referring physicians outlining these recommendations.  this review is focused on computer technologies for pain management that allow cdsss to obtain knowledge from the clinical data produced by either patients or health care professionals.  despite the known effectiveness of clinical decision support systems (cdss), none of these are available for back pain management.  many clinical decision support tools or databases are available to clinicians.  the use of computerized clinical decision support systems may improve the diagnosis and ongoing management of chronic diseases, which requires recurrent visits to multiple health professionals, disease and medication monitoring and modification of patient behavior.  the objective of this study was to identify information needs and decision support requirements for assessing, diagnosing, and treating chronic noncancer pain in primary care.  the use of computerized clinical decision support systems (ccdsss) may improve chronic disease management, which requires recurrent visits to multiple health professionals, ongoing disease and treatment monitoring, and patient behavior modification.  computer-based decision support systems can improve the process of care, but whether they improve patient outcomes in a cost-effective manner is uncertain.  given the scarcity of trustworthy clinical practice guidelines providing recommendations to answer clinicians' daily questions, clinical decision support systems (ie, assistance in question identification and answering) emerge as an attractive alternative.  however, these systems play an important role in the design of computerised systems oriented to a patient's symptoms as is required for pain management.  a novel cdss tool has the potential to assist with evidence-based management of back pain.  a comprehensive literature search was conducted in several electronic databases to identify relevant articles focused on computerised systems that constituted cdsss and include data or results related to pain symptoms from patients with acute or chronic pain, published between 1992 and 2011 in the english language.  clinical decision support (cds) systems provide clinicians and other health care stakeholders with patient-specific assessments or recommendations to aid in the clinical decision-making process.  few clinical guideline-based decision support systems (dss) have been successfully applied in chronic disease management.  the use of a cbds system may improve the ability of pcps to manage chronic pain and may also facilitate screening of consults to optimize specialist utilization.  clinical decision-support systems (cdsss) are computer programs that are designed to provide expert support for health professionals making clinical decisions. ||| ",Yes
Does the hERG gene code for a protein which is part of a sodium channel?,No,"The hERG gene, also known as KCNH2, codes for a protein that is part of a potassium channel, specifically the rapidly activating delayed rectifier potassium channel. This channel plays a crucial role in the repolarization phase of the cardiac action potential. The context provided discusses various sodium channels and their subunits, including the cardiac sodium channel (gene: scn5a, protein: nav1.5) and the neuronal voltage-gated sodium channel (gene: scn1a, protein: na(v)1.1). However, there is no mention of the hERG gene or its protein product being part of a sodium channel.","the voltage-gated 'glial' sodium channel nag belongs to a distinct molecular class within the multi-gene family of mammalian sodium channels.  the sodium channel nav1.6, encoded by the gene scn8a, is one of the major voltage-gated channels in human brain.  immunohistochemistry, western blot, and quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase pcr analysis were used to quantify sodium channel subunit protein and mrna expression in the san.  what is the relationship between sodium channel function, neuronal function and clinical status in channelopathies of the nervous system?  voltage-gated sodium channels comprise an ion-selective α-subunit and one or more associated β-subunits.  the cardiac voltage-gated sodium channel (gene: scn5a, protein: nav1.5) is responsible for the sodium current that initiates the cardiomyocyte action potential.  the expression of β-subunits together with α subunits enhances the na(+) current and modifies the channel activities.  the β3-subunit (encoded by the scn3b gene) is an important physiological regulator of the heart-specific sodium channel, nav1.5.  cardiac sodium channels are transmembrane proteins distributed in atrial and ventricular myocytes and purkinje fibers.  sodium channel 6 (nach6) is the alpha-subunit of a voltage-gated sodium channel expressed in the rat nervous system.  the voltage-gated sodium channel is a transmembrane protein essential for the generation of action potentials in excitable cells.  cardiac sodium channel is composed of a pore-forming α-subunit and one or two accessory β-subunits.  they comprise an α (navα) subunit that forms the channel pore and are coupled to one or more auxiliary β (navβ) subunits that modulate the gating to a variable extent.  the voltage-gated sodium channel  has recently been found in cardiac myocytes.  it has been reported that sodium channels purified from the electric organ of the electric eel, electrophorus electricus, and from chick cardiac muscle consist of a single polypeptide of relative molecular mass (mr) approximately 260,000, whereas those purified from rat brain and from rat and rabbit skeletal muscle contain, in addition to the large polypeptide, one or two smaller polypeptides of mr 33,000-43,000.  a common human epithelial sodium channel (enac) polymorphism, alphat663a, is present in the cytoplasmic c terminus of the alpha-subunit, although it is unclear whether this polymorphism segregates with blood pressure.  voltage-gated sodium channels composed of pore-forming alpha and auxiliary beta subunits are responsible for the rising phase of the action potential in cardiac muscle, but the functional roles of distinct sodium channel subtypes have not been clearly defined.  here we report that the messenger rnas generated by transcription of the cloned cdnas encoding the rat brain sodium channel large polypeptides, when injected into xenopus oocytes, can direct the formation of functional sodium channels.  the neuronal voltage-gated sodium channel na(v)1.1 encoded by the scn1a gene plays an important role in the generation and propagation of action potentials in the central nervous system.

Is the JNK pathway activated during liver regeneration?,Yes,"The JNK pathway is indeed activated during liver regeneration, as evidenced by its strong activation after partial hepatectomy. The JNK1 isoform, in particular, plays a crucial role in this process, with its activation in hematopoietic cells being essential for liver regeneration. Furthermore, a synergistic function between JNK1 in hepatocytes and hematopoietic-derived cells is involved in the hepatic regenerative response. The JNK pathway drives the transition of hepatocytes from the G0 to G1 phase, with cyclin D1 being a downstream target of this pathway during liver regeneration.","strong activation of jnk was reported in the regenerating liver, implicating jnk in growth stimulation of hepatocytes.  in the present study, we aimed to characterize and define the cell-type-specific contribution of jnk1 activation during liver regeneration.  in summary, we provide evidence that (1) jnk1 in hematopoietic cells is crucial for liver regeneration, and (2) a synergistic function between jnk1 in hepatocytes and hematopoietic-derived cells is involved in the hepatic regenerative response.  in conclusion, our data show that jnk drives g0 to g1 transition in hepatocytes and that cyclin d1 is a downstream target of the jnk pathway during liver regeneration.  liver regeneration is controlled by a complex network of signaling molecules, and a prominent role for c-jun n-terminal kinase has been suggested during this process.  our results show that liver regeneration was significantly impaired in jnk1(-/-) compared to jnk1(δhepa) and wt animals.  the c-jun-n-terminal kinase (jnk) pathway is strongly activated after partial hepatectomy (ph), but its role in hepatocyte proliferation is not known.  a role for jnk in liver parenchymal cells has been proposed, but more recent studies have implicated non-parenchymal liver cells as the relevant site of jnk signaling.  c-jun n-terminal kinase (jnk) is activated by multiple profibrogenic mediators; jnk activation occurs during toxic, metabolic, and autoimmune liver injury.  the transplantation of bone marrow-derived jnk1(-/-) into wt recipients caused significant reduction in liver regeneration.  interestingly, the transplantation of jnk1(-/-) into mice lacking jnk1 in hepatocytes only partially delayed liver regeneration.  c-jun n-terminal kinase (jnk) is a key regulator in tumor necrosis factor (tnf)-mediated liver injury.  c-jun n-terminal kinase (jnk) 1 and jnk2 are expressed in hepatocytes and have overlapping and distinct functions.  we performed gene expression microarray and phosphoproteomic analyses to determine mechanisms of jnk activity in hepatocytes.  additionally, bone marrow transplantation experiments were conducted in order to identify the contribution of hematopoietic cell-derived jnk1 activation for liver regeneration.  jnk may play a critical role in hepatocytes during tnf-stimulated cell death in vivo.  inhibition of jnk may be a new therapeutic strategy to prevent liver injury after transplantation.  in this study, we examined the effects of modulation of the jnk pathway in liver on insulin resistance and glucose tolerance.  c-jun n-terminal kinase (jnk) activation is pivotal in the development of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (nash).  the cjun nh2-terminal kinase (jnk) signaling pathway is required for the development of hepatitis and hepatocellular carcinoma. ||| ",Yes
Is RANKL secreted from the cells?,Yes,"Justification: The context suggests that RANKL is predominantly localized in lysosomal organelles, specifically secretory lysosomes, in osteoblastic cells. The translocation of RANKL to the cell surface in response to stimulation with RANK-FC-conjugated beads indicates that RANKL is secreted from the cells. Furthermore, the relocation of RANKL to the plasma membrane upon stimulation with RANK-FC-coated beads supports the notion of RANKL secretion. The involvement of VPS33A in transporting RANKL from the Golgi apparatus to secretory lysosomes also suggests the secretion of RANKL from the cells.","previously, rankl was found to be localized to secretory lysosomes in osteoblastic cells and to translocate to the cell surface in response to stimulation with rank-fc-conjugated beads.  the distribution of rankl-expressing cells was immunohistochemically observed.  we also showed that rankl is relocated to the plasma membrane in response to stimulation with rank-fc-coated beads, indicating that the lysosomal organelles where rankl is localized function as secretory lysosomes.  furthermore, knockdown of vps33a expression reduced the lysosomal storage of rankl and caused the accumulation of newly synthesized rankl in the golgi apparatus, indicating that vps33a is involved in transporting rankl from the golgi apparatus to secretory lysosomes.  rankl and rank were colocalised in mast cells of nasal mucosa tissue.  rankl is mainly expressed by synovial fibroblasts and t cells within the joints of rheumatoid arthritis patients.  expression of rankl protein and mrna was analyzed by flow cytometry, elisa, and real-time pcr.  here, we investigate under which conditions human basophils express rankl.  rankl was first discovered as a t cell-derived activator of dendritic cells (dcs) and has many functions in the immune system, including organogenesis, cellular development.  in this study, we showed that rankl is predominantly localized in lysosomal organelles, but little is found on the cell surface of osteoblastic cells.  the expression of rankl increased in endothelial cells, inflammatory cells and periodontal ligament cells.  rankl, a member of tumor necrosis factor (tnf) superfamily, regulates the differentiation, activation, and survival of osteoclasts through binding to its cognate receptor, rank.  rankl was specifically deleted in t cells (tnfsf11(flox/δ) lck-cre), in collagen vi expressing cells including synovial fibroblasts (tnfsf11(flox/δ) col6a1-cre) and in collagen ii expressing cells including articular chondrocytes (tnfsf11(flox/δ) col2a1-cre).  rankl plays a pivotal role in the differentiation, function and survival of osteoclasts, the principal bone-resorbing cells.  although rankl is expressed in most immune cells and tissues, it is not clear how this might affect allergic inflammation.  rankl is involved in multifaceted processes of immunoregulation and bone resorption such as they occur in rheumatoid arthritis (ra).  the expression of rankl on synovial fibroblasts rather than t cells is predominantly responsible for the formation of osteoclasts and erosions during inflammatory arthritis.  however, subcellular trafficking of rankl and its regulatory mechanisms in osteoblastic cells is still unclear.  these results suggest that rankl storage in secretory lysosomes is important to control osteoclast activation and to maintain bone homeostasis.  to date, studies on physiological role of rankl have been mainly carried out with extracellular rankl probably due to difficulties in achieving high level expression of functional transmembrane rankl (mrankl). ||| ",Yes
Does Vitamin D induce  autophagy?,Yes,"Vitamin D has been shown to induce autophagy through both genomic and non-genomic signaling pathways. It activates autophagy in various cellular settings and influences a wide range of physiological functions, including bone health and calcium metabolism.

Is K-63 linked protein ubiquitination related to proteasomal degradation?,Yes,"The role of K63-linked ubiquitination in proteasomal degradation is a topic of ongoing research. While K48-linked ubiquitination is well-established as a signal for proteasomal degradation, the function of K63-linked ubiquitination is less clear. However, recent studies suggest that K63-linked ubiquitination plays a critical role in proteasome-mediated substrate degradation. It serves as a ""seed"" for K48/K63 branched ubiquitin chains, enhancing the selectivity of the 26S proteasome for ubiquitinated proteins. This suggests that K63-linked ubiquitination is not only involved in non-degradative roles but also plays a role in proteasomal degradation. However, the exact mechanisms and the extent of this role are still under investigation.","in eukaryotic cells, ubiquitination of proteins leads to their degradation by the 26s proteasome.  here, we report that k63 ubiquitylation plays a critical role in proteasome-mediated substrate degradation by serving as a ""seed"" for k48/k63 branched ubiquitin chains.  the 26s proteasome mediates degradation of ubiquitin-conjugated proteins.  ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation is an important mechanism to control protein load in the cells.  in particular, k48 ubiquitin linkage targets proteins for degradation, whereas k63 ubiquitin linkage plays a nondegradative role.  this activation enhances the selectivity of the 26s proteasome for ubiquitinated proteins and links their deubiquitination to their degradation.  conventional lys48-linked poly-ubiquitination leads to the degradation of specific proteins through 26s proteasomes, while lys63-linked polyubiquitination appears to regulate protein activities in a non-proteolytic manner.  proteins that are destined for proteasome-mediated degradation are usually tagged with a chain of ubiquitin linked via lysine (k) 48 that targets them to the proteolytic machinery.  by virtue of its apparent dissociation from the proteasome, we have originally proposed that k63-linked ubiquitination may be involved in cargo diversion during proteasomal stress and accordingly, in the biogenesis of inclusion bodies associated with neurodegenerative diseases.  the ubiquitin proteasome pathway is responsible for most of the protein degradation in mammalian cells.  in recent years, several ubiquitin-like proteins have been isolated, but it is uncertain whether their roles are associated with protein degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome system.  abnormal proteins and regulators of many processes, are targeted for degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome system.  targeted protein degradation is largely performed by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, in which substrate proteins are marked by covalently attached ubiquitin chains that mediate recognition by the proteasome.  these results reveal a role for k63 chains as a substrate-specific mark for proteasomal degradation involved in regulating cell fate.  the role of lys-63 ubiquitin chains in targeting proteins for proteasomal degradation is still obscure.  although the role of lysine-48 (k48) polyubiquitination in proteasome-mediated degradation is fairly well characterized, much less is understood about the other types of ubiquitin chains and proteasome-independent functions.  proteolysis by the ubiquitin-proteasome system is considered to play a pathological role in several degenerative diseases that involve ubiquitinated inclusion bodies.  however, recent studies indicate that proteasome function is also tightly regulated and determines whether a ubiquitylated protein is destroyed or deubiquitylated and survives longer.  we systematically compared proteasomal processing of lys-63 ubiquitin chains with that of the canonical proteolytic signal, lys-48 ubiquitin chains.  this important cellular process is partly regulated by the ubiquitin-proteasome system through posttranslational modification by the conjugation of ubiquitin chains to proteins targeted for degradation by proteasomes. ||| ",No

Therefore, it is possible to purify pseudopodia for proteomic analysis.","we developed a novel application to conduct pseudopodia proteomics.  here we describe a method to biochemically purify the protruding pseudopodium from the cell body compartment using polycarbonate microporous filters.  however, it has been difficult to study pseudopodia formation because it has not been possible to purify this structure for biochemical analysis.  identification of pseudopodia proteins leads to a further understanding of malignant phenotypes of tumor cells and novel therapeutic strategies.  pseudopodia and cell bodies are then differentially scraped from the filter surface into lysis buffer for biochemical analysis.  this method will provide insights into the molecular details of pseudopodia and a further understanding of malignant phenotypes of tumor cells and novel therapeutic strategies.  in our application, tumor cells were placed on a fibronectin-coated porous membrane to form pseudopodia.  mass spectrometric protein identification revealed 46 pseudopodia-localizing proteins.  subcellular proteomics include, in its experimental workflow, steps aimed at purifying organelles.  the separation of pseudopodia and cell bodies was verified by electron microscopic examination of the respective platelet components.  pseudopodia are ventral actin-rich protrusions and play functional roles in cell migrations.  the methodology for producing pseudopodial preparations of platelets stimulated with thrombin, adp or calcium ionophore was established.  cells are cultured on top of 3.0-microm porous filters and allowed to extend pseudopodia through the small pores to the undersurface in response to a gradient of either chemokine or extracellular matrix (ecm) protein.  according to the motile potentials of the cells, the cells formed pseudopodial microprocesses in the pores.  using this method, it is possible to identify novel pseudopodium and cell body proteins as well as study the spatiotemporal organization of signaling processes that regulate pseudopodium formation and cell polarity.  proteins in whole cells and pseudopodia fractions were individually solubilized, labeled with a highly sensitive fluorescent dye, and separated using two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis.  to date, protrusion of pseudopodia has been considered to be primarily responsible for translocation of free-living amoebae and leukocytes of higher organisms.  platelet pseudopodia were compared to platelet cell bodies with respect to their lipid composition, fatty acid distribution and protein composition.  the localization of novel pseudopodia-localizing proteins such as rab1a, hsp90b, tdrd7, and vimentin was confirmed using immunohistochemical examinations.  the microscopic observations and the protein expression studies suggested that the laser treatment caused no apparent damages to pseudopodia. ||| ",Yes
Could DNA (cytosine-5-)-methyltransferases serve as tumour markers?,Yes,"DNA (cytosine-5-)-methyltransferases (DNMTs) have been identified as potential tumor markers due to their role in DNA methylation, a crucial epigenetic modification. Alterations in DNA methylation patterns, particularly 5-methylcytosine (5mc), are often associated with tumorigenesis and cancer progression. The reduction of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmc) content has been recognized as an epigenetic hallmark of human tumors. DNMTs catalyze the methylation of cytosine residues in the CpG sequence, and their expression levels have been analyzed in various cancer types, including colorectal adenocarcinoma and gastric carcinomas. Aberrant DNA methylation patterns have been found in cancer cells, and the global and gene-specific methylation of certain genes may serve as useful biomarkers for the early detection and clinical management of cancers such as cervical cancer. Therefore, DNMTs can serve as tumor markers due to their significant role in gene regulation and their potential as epigenetic modulators in cancer.","analysis of methylated dna, which refers to 5-methycytosine (5mc) versus cytosine (c) at specific loci in genomic dna (gdna), has received increased attention in epigenomics, particularly in the area of cancer biomarkers.  in this study, we tested cervical tissues at various stages of tumor progression for 5-methylcytosine and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine levels and also dna promoter methylation profile of a panel of genes for its diagnostic potential.  background: dna methylation is an important epigenetic modification, among which 5-methylcytosine methylation (5mc) is generally associated with tumorigenesis.  dna methylation (5-methylcytosine (5mc)) patterns are often altered in cancers.  alteration of dna methylation (5-methylcytosine, 5mc) patterns represents one of the causes of tumorigenesis and cancer progression.  5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmc) is converted from dna methylation of cytosine (5mc) by the catalysis of tet proteins, and proposed to be involved in tumorigenesis.  the development of new tools for tracking the activity of human dna methyltransferases is an important goal given the role of this enzyme as a cancer biomarker and epigenetic modulator.  as prevalent markers on dna, 5-methylcytosine (5mc), n6-methyladenine (6ma), and n4-methylcytosine (4mc) can be recognized by specific methyltransferases, facilitating cellular defense and the versatile regulation of gene expression in eukaryotes and prokaryotes.  the 5-methylcytosine and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine contents were significantly reduced in squamous cell carcinoma and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed a significant difference in (1) 5-methylcytosine between normal and squamous cell carcinoma tissues (area under the curve = 0.946) and (2) 5-hydroxymethylcytosine levels among normal, squamous intraepithelial lesions and squamous cell carcinoma.  recent studies have suggested that 5-methyl-2'-deoxycytidine (5medc) may be a marker of hypermethylation of dna.  thus, reduction of 5hmc content represents an epigenetic hallmark of human tumours, and according to our recent report, 5cac is enriched in a proportion of breast cancers and gliomas.  dna methylation (5-methylcytosine, 5mc) is involved in regulation of a wide range of biological processes.  we have used a highly quantitative 5' nuclease fluorogenic reverse transcription-pcr method (taqman) to analyze the expression of all three dna methyltransferase genes in 25 individual colorectal adenocarcinoma specimens and matched normal mucosa samples.  to investigate the association between methylation and expression at o6-methylguanine-dna methyltransferase, we performed methylation-specific pcr and immunohistochemistry in 149 gastric carcinomas.  aberrant dna methylation patterns are found in cancer cells.  the global and gene-specific methylation of the panel of genes identified in our study may serve as useful biomarkers for the early detection and clinical management of cervical cancer.  dna methylation entails the covalent addition of a methyl group to c-5 position of cytosine by a family of dna methyltransferase enzymes and has a significant role in gene regulation.  the correlation between the 5mc modification and tumor microenvironment cell infiltration was further assessed.  to examine correlation between the o6-methylguanine-dna methyltransferase expression and the clinical data, we investigated o6-methylguanine-dna methyltransferase expression in 315 consecutive gastric carcinomas.  dna cytosine 5-methyltransferase (dnmt) catalyzes methylation at the c5 position of the cytosine residues in the cpg sequence. ||| ",Yes
Do brown fat cells produce heat?,Yes,"Brown fat cells, also known as brown adipocytes, are indeed capable of producing heat. This process is primarily facilitated through a mechanism called thermogenesis, which involves the oxidation of fatty acids. Brown fat cells are enriched with mitochondria, the powerhouses of the cell, which play a crucial role in this process. The heat production is largely mediated by uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), which is expressed in the mitochondria of these cells. Upon stimulation, such as exposure to cold or consumption of high-calorie diets, brown fat cells can rapidly and efficiently increase heat production, thereby contributing to the regulation of body temperature and metabolic homeostasis.","does human brown fat actually combust fat to release heat?  brown adipocytes and beige adipocytes can expend energy, generate heat, and increase whole-body energy expenditure.  brown and beige (or brite) fat cells are capable of evoking non-shivering thermogenesis in response to cold and β-adrenergic stimulation.  brown adipocytes are the key cell type in brown adipose tissue (bat) that express the genes required for heat production through the process of thermogenesis.  brown adipocytes oxidize fatty acids to produce heat in response to cold or caloric overfeeding.  brown and beige adipocytes expend chemical energy to produce heat and are therefore important in regulating body temperature and body weight.  brown fat (brown adipose tissue, bat) primary function is to produce heat.  brown adipocytes are best known for their ability to convert chemical energy into heat.  brown fat is a specialized fat depot that can increase energy expenditure and produce heat.  brown adipocytes generate heat through the expression of mitochondrial ucp1.  brown adipocytes and the related beige adipocytes oxidize fatty acids and glucose to generate heat and are activated by cold exposure or consumption of high-calorie diets.  brown and beige adipocytes are mitochondria-enriched cells capable of dissipating energy in the form of heat.  brown adipose tissue (bat) can generate heat by burning fatty acids, a process mediated by uncoupling protein 1 (ucp1).  brown adipose tissue (bat) is specialized for uncoupled heat production through mitochondrion fueled majorly from fatty acids (fas) of lipid droplets (lds).  that adult humans possess brown fat is now accepted - but is the brown fat metabolically active?  brown and brown-like adipocytes are specialized adipocytes with a high capacity to convert metabolic energy to heat.  brown adipose tissue, the principal thermogenic organ, quickly and efficiently increases heat production by dissipating the mitochondrial proton motive force.  it has been suggested that activation of brown fat, via either environmental (i.e.  beige cells are brown-like adipocytes that arise in white adipose tissue in response to certain environmental cues to dissipate heat and improve metabolic homeostasis.  brown adipocytes (bas) are specialized for adaptive thermogenesis and, upon sympathetic stimulation, activate mitochondrial uncoupling protein (ucp)-1 and oxidize fatty acids to generate heat. ||| ",Yes
Does International Citicoline Trial on acUte Stroke trial supports efficacy of citicoline for stroke treatment?,No,"The International Citicoline Trial on Acute Stroke (ICTUS) aimed to assess the efficacy of citicoline in improving the outcome of patients with acute ischemic stroke. The results of this trial indicate that citicoline was safe but ineffective in improving the outcome of patients with acute ischemic stroke. Although a previous dose-comparison trial in patients with acute stroke found that 500 mg of citicoline appeared to improve neurological outcome with minimal side effects, the ICTUS trial did not find a significant improvement in global recovery in the citicoline group compared to the placebo group. Therefore, the ICTUS trial does not support the efficacy of citicoline for stroke treatment.","to determine the safety and efficacy of citicoline treatment in acute stroke patients.  this systematic review supports some benefits of citicoline in the treatment of acute ischemic stroke.  the international citicoline trial in acute stroke is a sequential phase iii study of the use of the drug citicoline in the treatment of acute ischaemic stroke, which was initiated in 2006 in 56 treatment centres.  citicoline is a drug approved for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke.  this study aims to assess whether starting citicoline treatment within 14 days after stroke onset improves the outcome in patients with acute ischemic stroke, as compared with placebo.  previous safety and efficacy trials in patients who have had acute strokes suggested that citicoline may improve neurologic outcome with minimal side effects.  citicoline is approved in some countries for the treatment of acute ischaemic stroke.  the results of this study indicate that citicoline was safe but ineffective in improving the outcome of patients with acute ischemic stroke who were enrolled in this trial.  in conclusion, this meta-analysis provides evidence of citicoline efficacy in stroke animal models and shows the optimal neuroprotective profile and the missing experimental requirements before jumping into clinical trials.  the neuroprotective actions of citicoline have been documented for experimental stroke therapy.  the neuroprotective potential of citicoline in acute ischemic stroke has been shown in many experimental studies and, although the exact mechanisms are still unknown, a clinical phase iii trial is currently underway.  this systemic review is based on ""pubmed"" and ""science direct"" search results for citicoline role in stroke and tbi.  this study suggests that oral citicoline can be used safely with minimal side effects in acute stroke treatment.  in this review, we focus on the latest publications or communications or both and on the major ongoing experimental and clinical projects involving citicoline in stroke recovery.  our present study was designed to check whether citicoline also enhances neuroregeneration after experimental stroke.  cytidine diphosphate choline (citicoline) has been previously shown to have efficacy in reducing the functional impairments associated with acute stroke.  citicoline was safe but ineffective in improving the outcome of patients with acute ischemic stroke as measured by the planned analyses.  a previous dose-comparison trial in patients with acute stroke found that 500 mg of citicoline appeared to improve neurological outcome with minimal side effects.  in humans, although a recent trial international citicoline trial on acute stroke (ictus) has shown that global recovery is similar in cdp-choline and placebo groups, cdp-choline was shown to be more beneficial in some patients, such as those with moderate stroke severity and not treated with t-pa. several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the beneficial actions of cdp-choline.  under the circumstances of the ictus trial, citicoline is not efficacious in the treatment of moderate-to-severe acute ischaemic stroke. ||| ",No
Is microRNA(miRNA) 29 involved in post-ischemic cardiac remodeling?,Yes,"The context suggests that microRNA-29 (miR-29) is involved in post-ischemic cardiac remodeling. MiR-29 is reported to function as an anti-fibrotic factor with potential therapeutic effects on cardiac fibrosis. The present study aimed to investigate the role and mechanism of miR-29b-3p in cardiac fibrosis after myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury. Additionally, it is observed that overexpression of miR-29a in mice inhibited cardiac hypertrophy, indicating its antagonistic effect on cardiac remodeling. These findings suggest that miR-29 plays a role in post-ischemic cardiac remodeling.","micrornas (mirnas) are implicated in the regulation of pathological and physiological processes in myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (mi/r).  micrornas (mirnas) have been reported to be implicated in the progression of cardiac fibrosis, but the functions and mechanisms of mir-30b-5p and mir-22-3p remain to be investigated.  microrna-29 (mir-29) is suggested to function as an anti-fibrotic factor with potential therapeutic effects on cardiac fibrosis.  the present study aimed to investigate the role and mechanism of mir-29b-3p in cardiac fibrosis after mi.  micrornas (mirnas) are critical regulatory factors in myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (i/r) injury.  micrornas (mirnas) play an important role in the pathogenesis of structural alterations of the failing heart through their ability to regulate negatively the expression levels of genes that govern the process of adaptive and maladaptive cardiac remodelling.  mirna-30c is differentially expressed in the heart during the progression towards heart failure and in vitro studies hint to its importance in cellular physiology.  microrna (mir) dysregulation in the myocardium has been implicated in cardiac remodeling after injury or stress.  it is concluded that mir-30e elevation alleviated cardiac function damage and promoted ventricular remodeling via sox9 repression.  circulating micrornas (mirnas) have been proposed as potential biomarkers for left ventricular remodeling in postinfarction heart failure (hf).  although few micrornas (mirnas) have been involved in the regulation of post-ischemic cardiac fibrosis, the exact effect and underlying mechanism of mirnas in cardiac fibrosis remains unclear.  here, we sought to investigate whether microrna-34 (mir-34) plays a role in the pathogenic development of myocardial fibrosis.  recently, the roles of micrornas (mirnas) in various cardiovascular diseases associated with cardiac fibrosis have been extensively investigated.  simultaneously, we observed that overexpression mir-29a mice inhibited but knockdown mir-29a mice increased cardiac cross-sectional area, indicating that mir-29a has an antagonistic effect on cardiac hypertrophy.  we thus establish an in vivo role for mirna-30c in cardiac physiology, particularly in mitochondrial function.  at present, studies have focused on micrornas (mirnas) in myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury (mi/ri).  in vivo, inhibition of mir-34a reduces the severity of experimental cardiac fibrosis in mice.  micrornas (mirnas) regulate many aspects of cellular function and their deregulation has been implicated in heart disease.  tgf-β1 increased mir-34a expression in cardiac fibroblasts.  as little is known about the in vivo function of mirna-30c in the heart, we generated transgenic mice that specifically overexpress mirna-30c in cardiomyocytes. ||| ",Yes

Is NEMO a zinc finger protein?,Yes,"The context indicates that NEMO (NF-κB essential modulator) is a regulatory protein that contains a classical CCHC-type zinc finger (ZF) motif in its regulatory C-terminal half. This ZF motif is capable of forming a specific complex with ubiquitin and is a bona fide ubiquitin-binding domain of the ubiquitin-binding ZF type. The context also mentions that several classes of ZF proteins have been shown to bind other metal ions, including iron. Therefore, it can be concluded that NEMO is indeed a zinc finger protein.","two variations of nemo's zinc finger are implicated in various disease states including ectodermal dysplasia and adult-onset glaucoma.  here, we report that the zinc finger (zf) motif, located in the regulatory c-terminal half of nemo, forms a specific complex with ubiquitin.  the regulatory domain is located in the c-terminal half of nemo and contains a classical cchc-type zinc finger (zf).  we recently demonstrated that the c-terminal zinc finger (zf) of nemo is also able to bind ubiquitin.  thus, our findings indicate that nemozfisa bona fide ubiquitin-binding domain of the ubiquitin-binding zinc finger type.  an important regulatory domain of nf-b essential modulator (nemo) is a ubiquitin-binding zinc finger, with a tetrahedral cys3his1 zinc-coordinating binding site.  the evolutionary conserved zinc finger protein znf503/zeppo2 (zinc finger elbow-related proline domain protein 2, zpo2) plays critical roles during embryogenesis.  recent study in several different systems has identified a set of novel zinc finger proteins that appear to form a distinct subfamily that we have named the net family.  neural zinc finger factor 1 (nzf-1) is a nonclassical zinc finger protein involved in neuronal development.  the net (noca, nlz, elb, tlp-1) subfamily of zinc finger proteins is an important mediator during developmental processes.  zinc finger swim-type containing 5 (zswim5) is a newly discovered protein, which contains a novel zinc-chelating domain swim (cxcxncxh), and is predicted to interact with dna or proteins.  altogether, these results shed light onto the role of nemo zf as a protein-binding motif and show that a precise structural integrity of the zf should be preserved to lead to a functional protein-recognition motif triggering full nf-kappab activation.  several classes of zinc finger proteins have been shown to bind other metal ions, including iron.  neural zinc finger factor 1 (nzf-1) is a member of a family of neural-specific transcription factors that contain multiple copies of a relatively uncharacterized zinc binding motif.  the zinc finger homeodomain enhancer-binding protein (zfhep) is involved in skeletal patterning, immune cell, muscle, and brain development, and is necessary for life.  previous studies have determined that the n-terminal region, a putative zinc finger, is capable of binding zn2+.  members of the net family (noc, nlz, elbow, and tlp-1) share two protein motifs--a buttonhead box and an sp motif--with zinc finger proteins from the sp family.  nemo (nf-kappab essential modulator) is a regulatory protein essential to the canonical nf-kappab signaling pathway, notably involved in immune and inflammatory responses, apoptosis, and oncogenesis.  c2h2 zinc finger proteins make up one of the largest protein families in eukaryotic organisms.  the negatively regulating zinc finger protein (nzfp) is an essential transcription repressor required for early development during gastrulation in xenopus laevis. ||| ",Yes

Has vitamin D has been shown to reduce incidence of falls in older people in clinical trials?,Yes,"Vitamin D supplementation has been shown to reduce the incidence of falls in older people in clinical trials. Meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials have demonstrated a decreased risk of falls in elderly individuals treated with vitamin D supplements. The reduction in fall risk is thought to be due to an improved neuromuscular function in vitamin D-replete subjects. Additionally, vitamin D combined with calcium has been shown to reduce the risk of falls. The evidence suggests that vitamin D supplementation should be integrated into primary and secondary fall prevention strategies in older adults.","a number of studies have hypothesized that vitamin d is a potential factor in the prevention of falls in the elderly; however, the effect of vitamin d is still inconsistent and not quantitative.  meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials (rcts) have shown a decreased risk of falls in elderly treated with vitamin d supplements, which may be due to an improved neuromuscular function in vitamin d-replete subjects.  through a 15-year literature overview, and after a brief reminder on mechanism of falls in older adults, we reported evidences for a vitamin d action on postural adaptations - i.e., muscles and central nervous system - which may explain the decreased fall and bone fracture rates and we underlined the reasons for differences and controversies between published data.  vitamin d combined with calcium reduces the risk of falls.  vitamin d affects bone and muscle health and likely reduces the risk of falls in the elderly.  the aim of this systematic review is to summarize the existing evidence on vitamin d use and the risk of falls.  we review the potential of vitamin d for the prevention of falls and fractures.  vitamin d use was associated with statistically significant reduction in the risk of falls (odds ratio for suffering at least one fall, 0.86; 95% confidence interval, 0.77-0.96).  eligible studies were randomized controlled trials in which the intervention was vitamin d and the incidence of falls was reported.  we conducted this meta-analysis to assess the effect of vitamin d on falls among elderly individuals.  to determine the effectiveness of targeted exercise training and vitamin d supplementation in reducing falls and injurious falls among older women.  there is increasing evidence that a supplementation of vitamin d and/or of calcium may reduce the fall and fracture rates.  vitamin d supplementation reduces the incidence of fractures in older adults.  there is evidence that disability severity and fall rates may be reduced by adequate vitamin d replacement.  we sought to determine whether monthly high-dose vitamin d supplementation reduces risk and incidence of falls.  because low levels of vitamin d have been associated with increased fall rates, many trials have been performed with vitamin d; two meta-analyses showed either a small effect or no effect of vitamin d on falls.  vitamin d supplementation should thus be integrated into primary and secondary fall prevention strategies in older adults.  this suggests that vitamin d supplementation improves neuromuscular or neuroprotective function, which may in part explain the mechanism whereby vitamin d reduces falls and fractures.  randomized controlled trials have shown that a combination of vitamin d and calcium can prevent fragility fractures in the elderly.  this randomized controlled trial will investigate the effects of an oral vitamin d loading dose with maintenance oral vitamin d and calcium on lower extremity function (gait velocity), correction of hypovitaminosis d, falls, and fractures among older people after hip fracture surgery. ||| ",Yes
Are there Conserved Noncoding Elements (CNEs) in plant genomes?,Yes,"Conserved Noncoding Elements (CNEs) are indeed present in plant genomes.

These CNEs are reliable pointers to regulatory elements controlling gene expression and could be linked to many important agronomic traits and ecological adaptations in crop genomes.","conserved noncoding elements (cnes) are elements exhibiting extreme noncoding conservation in metazoan genomes.  highly conserved noncoding elements (cnes) constitute a significant proportion of the genomes of multicellular eukaryotes.  plant genomes contain both protein-coding and noncoding sequences including transposable elements (tes) and noncoding rnas (ncrnas).  in vertebrates, conserved noncoding elements (cnes) are functionally constrained sequences that can show striking conservation over >400 million years of evolutionary distance and frequently are located megabases away from target developmental genes.  conserved noncoding sequences (cnss) in plants are much shorter, and it has been difficult to detect conservation among distantly related genomes.  surveys for conserved noncoding sequences (cns) among genes from monocot cereal species were conducted to assess the general properties of cns in grass genomes and their correlation with known promoter regulatory elements.  plant conserved noncoding sequences (cnss)--a specific category of phylogenetic footprint--have been shown experimentally to function.  conserved noncoding sequences (cnss) are evolutionarily conserved dna sequences that do not encode proteins but may have potential regulatory roles in gene expression.  no plant cns is conserved to the extent that ultraconserved noncoding sequences are conserved in vertebrates.  many studies on conserved noncoding sequences (cnss) have found that cnss are enriched significantly in regulatory sequence elements.  the ncrnas are recognized as important elements that play fundamental roles in the structural organization and function of plant genomes.  in this article, we show not only that cns sequences can be detected throughout the eudicot clade of flowering plants, but also that a subset of 37 cnss can be found in all flowering plants (diverging ∼170 million years ago).  conserved noncoding sequences (cnss) in dna are reliable pointers to regulatory elements controlling gene expression.  cns in crop genomes could be linked to many important agronomic traits and ecological adaptations.  conserved non-coding sequences (cns) are islands of non-coding sequence that, like protein coding exons, show less divergence in sequence between related species than functionless dna.  instances of highly conserved plant short interspersed nuclear element (sine) families and their enrichment near genes have been well documented, but little is known about the general patterns of such conservation and enrichment and underlying mechanisms.  we conducted whole-genome analysis on plant cnss to identify lineage-specific cnss in eudicots, monocots, angiosperms,and vascular plants based on the premise that lineage-specific cnss define lineage-specific characters and functions in groups of organisms.  comparative genomics approaches have identified numerous conserved cis-regulatory sequences near genes in plant genomes.  these cnss are candidate regulatory elements, which are expected to define lineage-specific features of various plant groups.  recently, a novel type of non-coding rna (ncrna), known as ncrna fragments or ncrfs, has been characterised in various organisms, including plants. ||| ",Yes
Have thyronamines effects on fat tissue?,No,"The context does not provide evidence of the effects of thyronamines on fat tissue. Thyronamines are not mentioned in the context, and the focus is on the effects of thyroid hormones, specifically triiodothyronine (T3) and thyrotropin (TSH), on adipose tissue. The context discusses the role of thyroid hormones in modulating adipose tissue differentiation and metabolism, their impact on lipid mobilization, and their potential involvement in the development of extrathyroidal manifestations of Graves' disease. However, without specific information on thyronamines, it is not possible to conclude that they have effects on fat tissue based on the provided context.","differentiation and metabolism of adipose tissue are modulated by thyroid hormones (ths), but relatively little is known about the metabolism of ths in this tissue.  increased lipid mobilization in thyrotoxicosis is attributed to amplification of catecholamine action in fat cells by thyroid hormones.  thyrotropin receptor (tshr) in extrathyroidal tissue, especially fat tissue, is supposed to have important roles in the development of extrathyroidal manifestations of graves' disease.  although tsh is the main regulator of thyroid growth and function, tsh binding activity in fat has long been reported.  our results document increased d1 gene expression and activity in adipose tissue of obese humans and suggest a role of 3,5,3'-triiodo-l-thyronine formed by d1 in response to leptin in the modulation of adipose tissue metabolism.  this study aimed to explore the relationship between abdominal fat distribution and free triiodothyronine (ft3) and ft3 to free thyroxine (ft4) ratio (ft3/ft4) in a euthyroid population.  in adipose tissue, changes in thyroid status result in alterations of lipolytic capacity.  in both subcutaneous and visceral fat, the thyroid gene expression (especially tshr) is reduced in obesity.  however, while it is unclear what the effects are of calorie restriction and high doses of triiodothyronine (t(3)) on adipokines in obesity, thyroid hormones are illicitly administered in isolation or in association with a hypocaloric diet as an obesity treatment.  thyroid hormones regulate energy balance and act on adipokines.  since the tsh receptor (tshr) has been detected in both preadipocytes and adipocytes, we hypothesized that it may play a role in adipose differentiation.  thyrotropin receptor (tsh-r) has been thought to be thyroid-specific, but, by northern blot analysis, we found that rat adipose tissue expressed tsh-r mrnas in amounts approaching those in the thyroid.  to investigate the influence of thyroid hormone status on adipose tshr expression, we induced hyper- and hypothyroidism in balbc mice by administering tri-iodothyronine and propylthiouracil respectively.  the objective of this study was to measure the expression of the tsh receptor (tshr) and the thyroid hormone receptor (tralpha1) genes in subcutaneous adipose tissue (sat) and visceral adipose tissue (vat) in obese individuals and to test the effect of weight loss on these genes.  in the present study, we investigated the effect of triiodothyronine (t3) on the expression of adiponectin mrna and the release of leptin and adiponectin by white adipose tissue (wat) explants obtained from epididymal (visceral) or inguinal (subcutaneous) depots from normal rats.  to determine whether tsh impacts adipogenesis, we examined how adipocytes responded to tsh at various points during their differentiation from cultured es cells.  thyroid hormones are key regulators of metabolism.  although thyroid hormones influence adipocyte metabolism, nt3bs have not been described in mature adipocytes yet.  the reversal of these changes with major weight loss and the reciprocal changes in plasma tsh and ft(3) levels suggest a role for adipocytes in the regulation of tsh and thyroid hormones.  this study examined whether tsh has direct effects on peripheral th metabolism and serum lipids. ||| ",Yes
Are there clinical trials on stem cells in multiple sclerosis,Yes,"Justification: The context indicates that clinical trials are being conducted to evaluate the safety and feasibility of treatment with a candidate cell-based therapy, specifically mesenchymal stem cells, in multiple sclerosis. The trials aim to inform the design of early phase clinical trials for evaluating neuroprotective therapies in progressive multiple sclerosis. Additionally, the context mentions that autologous bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells are being examined in clinical trials for multiple sclerosis. The context also references a phase I trial in which autologous, bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells were isolated from trial participants with multiple sclerosis and culture-expanded for clinical use.","the mesenchymal stem cells in multiple sclerosis (mscims) trial tests the safety and feasibility of treatment with a candidate cell-based therapy, and will inform the wider challenge of designing early phase clinical trials to evaluate putative neuroprotective therapies in progressive ms.  this article provides an overview of the current knowledge relating to the potential use of transplanted stem cells in the treatment of patients with multiple sclerosis (ms).  stem cells offer the potential for regeneration of lost tissue in neurological disease, including multiple sclerosis (ms).  in the last decade several studies employing stem cells-based therapies have been investigated as an optional treatment for multiple sclerosis.  cell-based therapies for multiple sclerosis (ms), including those employing autologous bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (msc) are being examined in clinical trials.  stem cell transplantation approaches offer for the first time the opportunity to design therapeutic approaches for multiple sclerosis (ms) with curative intent.  to determine the feasibility of culture-expanding multiple sclerosis patients' mesenchymal stem cells for clinical use.  their development in vitro and their use in vivo in animal models of degenerative neurological disease and recent first efforts in human clinical trials were the topics of a recent international meeting sponsored by the multiple sclerosis international federation and the national multiple sclerosis society on ""stem cells & ms: prospects and strategies"" participants reviewed the current state of knowledge about the potential use of stem and progenitor cells in ms and other degenerative neurological disorders and outlined a series of urgent fundamental and applied clinical research priorities that should allow the potential of regeneration of damaged tissue in ms to be assessed and pursued.  recent studies have investigated the potential of autologous bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (mscs) as a therapy for multiple sclerosis.  published experience of culture-expanding multiple sclerosis patients' mesenchymal stem cells for clinical trials is limited.  mesenchymal stem cells (mscs) have emerged as a potentially powerful cellular therapy for autoimmune diseases including multiple sclerosis (ms).  multiple sclerosis is an inflammatory, neurodegenerative disease of the central nervous system for which therapeutic mesenchymal stem cell transplantation is under study.  there is currently great interest in the use of mesenchymal stem cells as a therapy for multiple sclerosis with potential to both ameliorate inflammatory processes as well as improve regeneration and repair.  in recent years, in the effort to find a potential innovative therapy for multiple sclerosis (ms), researchers focused on transplantation of mesenchymal stem cells (mscs) due to their well-recognized ability to suppress inflammatory/autoimmune responses and exert neuroregenerative properties.  bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (bm-mscs) are an attractive cell based therapy in the treatment of cns demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis (ms).  in this case report we present the treatment of aggressive multiple sclerosis with multiple allogenic human umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cell and autologous bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells over a 4 y period.  moreover, we propose that unconventional sources of stem cells, which show characteristics similar to that of bm-mscs, and being less invasive for removal, could be considered an excellent alternative to bm-mscs and thus could be a promising innovative approach for ms treatment.  to date, several encouraging results were obtained mainly from the use of mscs derived from the bone marrow (bm-mscs) in experimental models of ms as well as in clinical trials.  the potential of autologous cell-based therapies including those using multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (mscs) is being investigated for multiple sclerosis (ms) and other neurological conditions.  in a phase i trial, autologous, bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells were isolated from 25 trial participants with multiple sclerosis and eight matched controls, and culture-expanded to a target single dose of 1-2 × 106 cells/kg. ||| ",Yes
Is there an association between borna virus and brain tumor?,Yes,"Borna disease virus (BDV) has been identified as a potential infectious agent involved in the development of central nervous system (CNS) diseases. The virus has been found to infect humans and is possibly associated with certain neuropsychiatric disorders. The presence of BDV-specific nucleic acids has been detected in a large collection of autopsy brain samples, indicating the possibility of persistent BDV infections in the human CNS. The virus has also been shown to induce neurological disease in animals. The association between BDV and brain tumors is further supported by the detection of low copy numbers of BK virus tag gene in brain tumor cells, which may indicate that BK virus, a member of the polyomavirus family, may contribute to tumor induction by indirect mechanisms or neuro-persistence. The significance of viral pathogens in brain tumors is controversial, but the presence of subfractions of viral DNA has been reported in various circumstances, and the oncogenicity of some viruses has been demonstrated in animal experiments. The detection of BK virus sequences in primary brain tumors, such as schwannomas and meningiomas, further supports the association between BDV and brain tumors.","borna disease virus (bdv) is one of the potential infectious agents involved in the development of central nervous system (cns) diseases.  serological and molecular epidemiological studies indicate that borna disease virus (bdv) can infect humans and is possibly associated with certain neuropsychiatric disorders.  borna disease virus (bdv), the prototypic member of the family bornaviridae within the order mononegavirales, provides an important model for the investigation of viral persistence within the central nervous system (cns) and of associated brain disorders.  borna disease virus (bdv) can induce neurological disease in animals.  due to persistent infections of human central nervous system (cns), polyomaviruses have been identified as one of the risk factors for brain tumor development.  borna disease virus (bdv) causes central nervous system (cns) disease that is frequently manifested by behavioral abnormalities.  to estimate the frequency of persistent borna disease virus (bdv) infections of the human central nervous system and to determine which neuropsychiatric disorders might be associated with this viral infection, reverse transcription-nested polymerase chain reaction was used to screen a large collection of autopsy brain samples for the presence of bdv-specific nucleic acids.  borna disease (bd) has been recognized as a virally induced t-cell dependent immunopathological disorder of the central nervous system (cns), as shown by experimental infection of rats with borna disease virus (bdv).  taken together, in the present study low copy numbers of bk virus tag gene was detected in brain tumor cells, which can indicate that bk virus may contribute to tumor induction by indirect mechanisms or neuro-persistence of this virus without any pathological consequences.  more recently a number of head and neck tumors have been shown to harbor the virus, suggesting a possible role for ebv in their development.  association of some neurotropic viruses like borna disease virus and herpes virus with schizophrenia is better explained.  in primary brain tumors, bk virus sequences were recognized more frequently in schwannomas (15.5%) and meningiomas (12.1%).  the significance of viral pathogens in brain tumors is controversial, and human cytomegalovirus (hcmv) has been associated with glioblastoma (gbm) in some but not all studies, making the role of hcmv unclear.  whether borna disease virus (bdv-1) is a human pathogen remained controversial until recent encephalitis cases showed bdv-1 infection could even be deadly.  viruses are thought to be involved in some neurological diseases, the presence of subfractions of viral dna has been reported in various circumstances and the oncogenicity of some viruses has been demonstrated in animal experiments.  having a large bank of tumor material available, we systematically examined 39 brain tumors using southern blot hybridization with dnas of three viruses, known to be involved in neurological diseases: herpes simplex virus (hsv), simian virus 40 (sv40) and adenovirus type 2 (ad2).  to assess the prevalence of bk virus sequences, a total of 58 fresh brain tumors were examined by quantitative real-time pcr.  indications exist in the scientific literature that infection with human herpes family viruses may contribute to the pathogenesis of neuroblastoma (nb).  little is known about oncogenesis in brain tumors.  viral pathogens have been implicated in the development of certain cancers including human papillomavirus (hpv) in squamous cell carcinoma and epstein-barr virus (ebv) in burkitt's lymphoma. ||| ",No

Is the protein Papilin secreted?,No,"The context provided discusses the secretion of pancreatic stone protein (psp/reg) and pancreatitis-associated protein (pap) in pancreatic juice. However, there is no mention of a protein called Papilin. Therefore, based on the given context, it cannot be determined whether Papilin is a secreted protein or not.","pancreatic stone protein (psp/reg) is a constitutively secreted protein in pancreatic juice.  rat pancreatitis-associated protein (pap) is an additional protein appearing in pancreatic juice after induction of prancreatic inflammation.  pap is a 16 kda secretory protein structurally related to the c-type lectins although classical lectin-related function has not been reported yet.  it is precursor to a spontaneously precipitating peptide called pancreatic thread protein, which is found in protein plugs within the pancreatic ductal system.  pancreatitis-associated protein 1 (pap1) belongs to the reg family of secretory proteins.  pancreatitis-associated protein (pap) belongs to the same family of proteins.  pancreatitis-associated protein (pap) was discovered in the pancreatic juice of rats with acute pancreatitis.  pancreatic stone protein/reg protein (psp/reg) is a secretory pancreatic protein of hitherto unknown function.  pancreatic concentration of pap mrna increased more than 300 x within 12 h whereas concentrations of mrnas encoding major secretory proteins such as amylase decreased.  pap is highly increased during acute pancreatitis, while no exact data exist regarding psp/reg protein synthesis and secretion.  although parvulin (par14/eukaryotic parvulin homolog), a peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase, is found associated with the preribosomal ribonucleoprotein (pre-rrnp) complexes, its roles in ribosome biogenesis remain undetermined.  the deduced amino acid sequence revealed that pap was synthetized as a preprotein with, in its mature form, a predicted molecular weight of 16,630.  pol peptide, an oligopeptide corresponding to the 27 c-terminal amino acids of dna polymerase from herpes simplex virus type 1, has recently been suggested to translocate from endosomal compartments into the cytosol after being intracellularly delivered via a protein carrier.  although the posterior pituitary is known to contain the prl releasing activity or factor (prf), its chemical identification has been a matter of dispute.  profilin was first identified as an actin monomer binding protein; however, recent reports indicate its involvement in actin polymerization.  the regulation of psp/reg thus differs from that of most other pancreatic secretory proteins.  paxillin (pxn) is a focal adhesion protein that has been implicated in signal transduction from the extracellular matrix.  pirin is a novel highly conserved nuclear protein, but very little is known about its cellular function.  in a diet study with rats, we tested the hypothesis that protein malnutrition leads to increased psp/reg concentrations in pancreatic juice.  in our present study, we found that paip1 was over-expressed in human pc tissues. ||| ",Yes
Are proteasome inhibitors good candidates for treatment of leukemia and solid tumors?,Yes,"Proteasome inhibitors have been shown to have clinical efficacy against both hematological and solid cancer types, including acute myeloid leukemia and non-small cell lung cancer. In preclinical studies, proteasome inhibitors induced apoptosis and inhibited tumor growth, supporting their potential role in the treatment of various tumor types. The proteasome is emerging as a target for cancer therapy because small molecule inhibitors of its catalytic activity induce apoptosis in both in vitro and in vivo models of human malignancies. Proteasome inhibitors display potent anti-neoplastic and anti-angiogenic properties both in vitro and in vivo. Inhibition of the proteasome represents an attractive target in the development of new drug therapies, proteasome inhibitors being potentially useful tools for the treatment of pathologies such as cancer.","proteasome inhibitors have been approved in clinical use against hematologic malignancies, but their application in solid tumors is uncertain.  proteasome inhibitors have been suggested as potential anticancer agents in many clinical trials.  although proteasome inhibitors have been most successfully applied in the treatment of hematological malignancies, they also received continuing interest for the treatment of solid tumors.  proteasome inhibitors have demonstrated promise in vitro, and as a result clinical trials have begun to investigate these agents as therapy for numerous human cancers.  while several proteasome inhibitors have been successfully approved by the food and drug administration for the treatment of hematological malignancies, the clinical efficacy of these inhibitors is unexpectedly lower in the treatment of solid tumors due to the functional and structural heterogeneity of proteasomes in solid tumors.  proteasome inhibitors are effective agents against multiple myeloma and mantle cell lymphoma and display great potential as treatment for a variety of other malignancies.  in this review, we summarize the current positioning of proteasome inhibitors in the treatment of common solid malignancies (e.g., lung, colon, pancreas, breast, and head and neck cancer), addressing topics of their mechanism(s) of action, predictive factors and molecular mechanisms of resistance.  there are ongoing trials to examine the effectiveness of compound and novel proteasome inhibitors that can target solid tumors either alone or in combination with conventional chemotherapeutic agents.  the clinical successes of proteasome inhibitors for the treatment of cancer have highlighted the therapeutic potential of targeting this protein degradation system.  growing evidence from translational research and clinical trials proved the effectiveness of proteasome inhibitors (pis) in treating several types of hematological malignancies.  proteasome inhibitors represent a novel class of drugs that have clinical efficacy against hematological and solid cancer types, including acute myeloid leukaemia, myelodysplastic syndrome an non-small cell lung cancer.  in preclinical studies, proteasome inhibitors (pis) induced apoptosis and inhibited tumor growth, supporting their potential role in the treatment of various tumor types, especially hematologic malignancies.  the proteasome is emerging as a target for cancer therapy because small molecule inhibitors of its catalytic activity induce apoptosis in both in vitro and in vivo models of human malignancies and are proving to have efficacy in early clinical trials.  the inhibitors of proteasomes have recently been shown to induce apoptosis of tumor cells in vitro and to exert significant antitumor effects in murine tumor models in vivo.  cancer cells are particularly sensitive to proteasome inhibitors, indicating the utility for inhibition of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway as an approach for cancer therapy.  the cellular proteasome is an important molecular target in cancer therapy and drug resistance research.  proteasome inhibitors display potent anti-neoplastic and anti-angiogenic properties both in vitro and in vivo.  inhibition of the proteasome, the multicatalytic protease complex responsible for the turnover of many cellular proteins, represents an attractive target in the development of new drug therapies, proteasome inhibitors being potentially useful tools for the treatment of pathologies such as cancer, as well as inflammatory, immune and neurodegenerative diseases.  this review explores new information about how the proteasome regulates apoptosis and how proteasome inhibitors can be exploited as anti-tumor drugs.  our developed techniques and generated results will serve as a valuable guideline for investigators developing a new generation of proteasome inhibitors as an effective targeted therapy for solid tumors. ||| ",Yes
Does fibronectin constitute a serum biomarker for Duchenne muscular dystrophy?,No,"The context does not provide information on the use of fibronectin as a serum biomarker for Duchenne muscular dystrophy. However, it does discuss the role of extracellular matrix components, including fibronectin, in the fibrosis observed in Duchenne muscular dystrophy. The context also mentions the quantification of several ECM components in primary DMD and control myotube cultures, but it does not specify whether fibronectin was one of them. Therefore, based on the provided context, it cannot be determined whether fibronectin constitutes a serum biomarker for Duchenne muscular dystrophy.","extent of muscle fibrosis contributes to disease severity in muscular dystrophies.  to investigate whether extracellular matrix (ecm) components contribute to the severe fibrosis observed in duchenne muscular dystrophy (dmd) skeletal muscle, we quantitated several ecm components (transcripts and proteins) in primary dmd and control myotube cultures.  we have previously shown that duchenne muscular dystrophy (dmd) can be diagnosed by fetal muscle biopsy and immunohistochemical staining showing the absence of dystrophin.  duchenne muscular dystrophy (dmd), the most severe form of inherited muscular dystrophies, is known to be caused by a deficiency of the protein ""dystrophin"", but the pathophysiologic consequences of this lack have not as yet been elucidated.  duchenne muscular dystrophy, an x-linked recessive neuromuscular disorder due to lack of the protein dystrophin, manifests as progressive muscle degeneration and cardiomyopathy with increased fibrosis.  a deficiency of the protein dystrophin has recently been shown to be the probable cause of duchenne's muscular dystrophy.  we sought to determine the relation between the clinical phenotype and the status of dystrophin in muscle-biopsy specimens from 103 patients with various neuromuscular disorders.  duchenne muscular dystrophy (dmd) is a progressive muscle-wasting disease resulting from lack of the sarcolemmal protein dystrophin.  to determine whether a decrease in matrix degradation contributes to the severe fibrosis seen in duchenne muscular dystrophy (dmd), we quantified rna transcript numbers for the fibrolytic matrix metalloproteinases (mmp)-1 and -2 and their natural tissue inhibitors (timp)-1 and -2 in dmd muscle as well as in pathological and normal controls.  the biochemical assay for dystrophin should prove helpful in delineating myopathies that overlap clinically with duchenne's and becker's dystrophies, and it shows promise as an accurate diagnostic tool.  duchenne muscular dystrophy (dmd) is caused by loss of the structural protein, dystrophin, resulting in muscle fragility.  in duchenne muscular dystrophy muscle, the lack of dystrophin is accompanied by alterations in the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex.  duchenne muscular dystrophy results from the absence of the protein dystrophin and the associated dystrophin - glycoprotein complex, which are thought to provide both structural support and signaling functions for the muscle fiber.  duchenne muscular dystrophy arises due to the lack of the cytoskeletal protein dystrophin.  duchenne muscular dystrophy (dmd) is a genetic condition caused by mutations in the dmd gene leading to muscle degeneration, fatty replacement of muscle cells and fibrosis.  the gene encoding dysferlin was sequenced in patients with suspected dysferlin-deficient muscular dystrophy.  in dystrophinopathies, disease severity is generally related to the extent of muscle fibrosis.  duchenne muscular dystrophy (dmd) is a progressive neuromuscular disease characterized by extensive muscle weakness.  duchenne muscular dystrophy results from loss of the protein dystrophin, which links the intracellular cytoskeletal network with the extracellular matrix, but deficiency in this function does not fully explain the onset or progression of the disease.  duchenne muscular dystrophy (dmd) is characterized by muscle degeneration and structural defects in the neuromuscular synapse that are caused by mutations in dystrophin. ||| ",Yes
Are loop domains preserved upon cohesin loss?,No,"The evidence suggests that cohesin is required for the formation and maintenance of loop domains. Cohesin, along with its cofactor NIPBL-MAU2, forms chromatin loops via a process called loop extrusion. This process involves the formation and enlargement of DNA loops, with cohesin and NIPBL-MAU2 residing at the base of loops. Furthermore, cohesin is protected against loop release by CTCF and the acetyltransferase ESCO1, enabling the formation of long and presumably long-lived loops. Therefore, it is hypothesized that cohesin is the main driver of long-range chromatin interactions. Consequently, the loss of cohesin would likely result in the disruption of loop domains.","evidence for structural changes of these domains compared to controls suggests that cohesin is required for their full integrity.  recent experiments suggest that the formation of loops might be mediated by loop extrusion factor proteins such as cohesin.  tads and many loops are formed by cohesin and positioned by ctcf.  loop formation and maintenance depend on cohesin's atpase activity and on nipbl-mau2, but not on topological entrapment of dna by cohesin.  we demonstrate that this interaction is specifically required for ctcf-anchored loops and contributes to the positioning of cohesin at ctcf binding sites.  such an activity has been observed for condensin, which forms loops in mitosis, but not for cohesin.  cohesin forms chromatin loops via loop extrusion, a process that involves the formation and enlargement of dna loops.  we show that cohesin binding shows greater lineage- and stage-specificity than ctcf at most agr loci, providing more specificity to the loops.  these structures depend on cohesin, a ring-shaped dna-entrapping adenosine triphosphatase (atpase) complex that has been proposed to form loops by extrusion.  cohesin catalyses the folding of the genome into loops that are anchored by ctcf1.  during loop formation, cohesin and nipbl-mau2 reside at the base of loops, which indicates that they generate loops by extrusion.  we explore here several physical scenarios, where loop maintenance is due to diffusing cross-linkers (cohesin stabilized by two ctcf molecules) that can bind and unbind at the base of chromatin loops.  in this review, we discuss recent insights and consider how cohesin and ctcf together may orchestrate the folding of the genome into chromosomal loops.  the cohesin complex mediates dna-dna interactions both between (sister chromatid cohesion) and within chromosomes (dna looping).  recently, global mapping of pairwise contacts showed that loops anchoring topological domains (tads) are highly conserved between cell types and species.  our data suggest that ctcf enables the formation of chromatin loops by protecting cohesin against loop release.  our results indicate that ctcf and the acetyltransferase esco1 protect a subset of cohesinstag1 complexes from wapl, thereby enable formation of long and presumably long-lived loops, and that esco1, like ctcf, contributes to boundary formation in chromatin looping.  cohesin is hypothesized to be the main driver of these long-range chromatin interactions by the process of loop extrusion.  using super-resolution microscopy, we visualize that loops in intact nuclei are formed by a scaffold of cohesin complexes from which the dna protrudes.  our data are consistent with a model of nested loop extrusion, in which acetylated cohesinstag1 forms stable loops between ctcf sites, demarcating the boundaries of more transient cohesinstag2 extrusion activity. ||| ",No

Is p53 a transcription factor?,Yes,"The tumor suppressor p53 is indeed a transcription factor. It binds to specific DNA sequences and activates transcription from various promoters. This activity is regulated by several factors, including subcellular localization and phosphorylation status of the protein. p53 acts as a transcriptional regulator, modulating transcription of several promoters. It is a sequence-specific DNA-binding protein that can activate transcription from promoters bearing p53-binding sites. p53 is also known to autoregulate its own transcription, further supporting its role as a transcriptional activator.","the tumor suppressor p53 possesses characteristics of a transcription factor; it binds to specific dna sequences and activates transcription from various promoters.  p53, known as a tumor suppressor gene, is a transcription factor that regulates various cellular functions.  compelling evidence indicates that p53 acts as a transcription factor and that this activity is regulated by several factors including subcellular localization and phosphorylation status of the protein.  p53 acts as a transcriptional regulator that binds to dna and modulates transcription of several promoters.  antioncogene product p53 is a transcriptional transactivator.  p53 has trans-activates or downregulates its own transcription.  these results imply that p53 may be a transcriptional activating factor (taf); furthermore, these data lend support to the hypothesis of p53 as a positive regulator of transcription which might mediate its tumor suppressor role by inducing expression of a set of genes with a negative effect on cellular growth.  to investigate how p53 stimulates transcription, we examined the interaction of p53 with general transcription factors in vitro.  the tumor suppressor, p53, has been shown to transcriptionally activate or silence a number of target genes.  p53 is a sequence-specific dna-binding oligomeric protein that can activate transcription from promoters bearing p53-binding sites.  the product of the tumor suppressor gene p53 binds to dna and activates transcription from promoters containing its consensus binding site.  the wild-type p53 protein is a transcriptional activator implicated in the control of cellular growth-related gene expression.  p53 autoregulates its own promoter indirectly and in a cell type-specific manner.  the tumor suppressor protein p53 acts as a transcriptional activator that can mediate cellular responses to dna damage by inducing apoptosis and cell cycle arrest.  p53 is most commonly described as a tumor suppressor, or anti-oncogene, although its role in vivo remains unclear.  p53 on its own promoter in different cell lines that do not express p53.  recently, several growth factor gene promoters, including that of transforming growth factor alpha (tgf-alpha), were shown to be direct targets of p53-mediated transcription.  the p53 tumor suppressor gene, which is considered the guardian of the genome, encodes a phosphoprotein, which is a sequence-specific transcriptional activator or repressor of target genes.  wild-type p53 has also been shown to autoregulate its own transcription.  p53 is a nuclear phosphoprotein, and phosphorylation has been proposed to be a means by which the activity of p53 is regulated. ||| ",Yes
"SGOT is an abbreviation for an enzyme other wise known as alanine amino transferase, yes or no?",No,"Justification: The provided context discusses the enzyme aspartate aminotransferase (AAT), also known as aspartate transaminase (AST), which catalyzes the transamination of L-aspartate to oxaloacetate. The context does not mention the enzyme alanine amino transferase or the abbreviation SGOT. Therefore, it can be concluded that SGOT is not an abbreviation for alanine amino transferase based on the provided context.","aspartate aminotransferase (aat) catalyzes amino group transfer from glutamate (glu) or aspartate (asp) to a keto acid acceptor-oxaloacetate (oa) or alpha-ketoglutarate (kg), respectively.  this enzyme shows not only the agt activity but also serine:pyruvate and serine: glyoxylate aminotransferase (spt and sgt) activities.  in the assay of agt activity using crude enzyme preparations, there is the complication that glutamate:glyoxylate aminotransferase (ggt) also contributes to agt activity, but at present no other enzyme is known to catalyze transamination between l-serine and glyoxylate or pyruvate.  glutamate 1-semialdehyde aminotransferase (gsa-at) catalyzes the transfer of the c2 amino group of glutamate 1-semialdehyde (gsa) to the c1 position.  exchange is dependent on aat concentration, time-dependent, proportional to the amino-to-keto acid ratio, and blocked by aminooxyacetate (aoa), an aat inhibitor.  glutamate 1-semialdehyde aminotransferase (glutamate 1-semialdehyde 2,1-aminomutase; ec 5.4.3.8; gsa-at) catalyzes the transfer of the amino group on carbon 2 of glutamate 1-semialdehyde (gsa) to the neighboring carbon 1 to form delta-aminolevulinic acid (ala).  this mutation is located in exon 2 of the agt gene and leads to the loss of an avai restriction site.  we have examined assay methods and conditions for human liver alanine:glyoxylate aminotransferase (agt).  aspartate aminotransferase (ast) can exist as a macroenzyme by forming a complex with an immunoglobulin.  data presented here show that aat catalyzes two partial reactions resulting in isotope exchange between 3h-labeled glu or 3h-labeled asp and the cognate keto acid in the absence of the keto acid acceptor required for the net reaction.  aat-2 uses 2-amino-4-methoxy-4-oxobutanoic acid at a similar rate as l-aspartate but aat-1 uses this substrate at a slower rate.  stoichiometry of purified astgt demonstrated that 0.1 pyridoxal phosphate was attached per subunit of the enzyme.  selenocysteine (sec) trna()sec donates sec to protein, but interestingly, this amino acid is synthesized on trna which is first aminoacylated with serine.  there was a combined good correlation between the agt, sgt and spt activities, and the activity ratio, agt : sgt : spt was about 1.0 : 0.17 : 0.13.  oligosaccharyltransferase (ost) transfers an oligosaccharide chain to the asn residue in the asn-x-ser/thr sequon in proteins, where x is not proline.  we have synthesized and sequenced alanine:glyoxylate aminotransferase (agt; hgmw-approved symbol for the gene--agxt) cdna from the liver of a primary hyperoxaluria type 1 (ph1) patient who had normal levels of hepatic peroxisomal immunoreactive agt protein, but no agt catalytic activity.  aspartate aminotransferase (aat, ec 2.6.1.1) catalyses the transamination of l-asparate to oxaloacetate.  aat isotope exchange is discussed in the context of the glutamate/glutamine shuttle hypothesis for astrocyte/neuron carbon cycling.  this revealed the presence of a single point mutation (g----a at cdna nucleotide 367), which is predicted to cause a glycine-to-glutamate substitution at residue 82 of the agt protein.  although serine acetyltransferase (sat) from escherichia coli is homologous with a number of bacterial enzymes that catalyze o-acetyl transfer by a sequential (ternary complex) mechanism, it has been suggested, from experiments with the nearly identical enzyme from salmonella typhimurium, that the reaction could proceed via an acetyl-enzyme intermediate. ||| ",No
Is the length of the poly(A) tail involved in human disease?,Yes,"The length of the poly(A) tail is involved in human disease, as alterations in its length can impact the stability, nuclear export, and translation of mRNA transcripts. Poly(A) polymerases, which add the poly(A) tail to the 3' end of nearly all eukaryotic mRNAs, are associated with proliferation and cancer. Furthermore, difficulties in globally measuring poly(A)-tail lengths have impeded a greater understanding of poly(A)-tail function in disease. Therefore, the length of the poly(A) tail plays a critical role in mRNA stability and translation, and its dysregulation can contribute to human disease.","therefore, identifying alterations in poly(a) tail length can yield important insights into an mrna's function and subsequent physiological impact.  poly(a) tail length is a readout of an mrna's translatability and stability, especially in developmental systems.  poly(a) tail length is emerging as an important marker of mrna fate, where deviations from the canonical length can signal degradation or nuclear retention of transcripts.  poly(a) tail length plays an important role in mrna stability and translational control.  the length of the poly(a) tail influences the stability, nuclear export and translation of mrna transcripts.  three methods for measuring the length of a poly(a) tail are presented: the poly(a) length assay, the ligation-mediated poly(a) test (lm-pat), and the rnase h assay.  a characteristic aspect of poly(a) tail function is furthermore that it can be modulated by changes in its length.  poly(a) tails are important elements in mrna translation and stability, although recent genome-wide studies have concluded that poly(a) tail length is generally not associated with translational efficiency in nonembryonic cells.  the poly(a) tail is a homopolymeric stretch of adenosine at the 3'-end of mature rna transcripts and its length plays an important role in nuclear export, stability, and translational regulation of mrna.  in this review, we focus on the role of nab2 in poly(a) tail length control and speculate on potential mechanisms by which nab2 could regulate poly(a) tail length based on reported physical and genetic interactions.  a number of approaches have been developed to measure the length and position of the poly(a)-tail.  the poly(a) tail influences mrna translation and stability, but it is unclear whether there are global roles of poly(a)-tail lengths in cell stress.  control of poly(a) tail length is thus an important mechanism to regulate the abundance and ultimate translation of transcripts.  poly(a) polymerases add the poly(a) tail at the 3' end of nearly all eukaryotic mrna, and are associated with proliferation and cancer.  poly(a) tails enhance the stability and translation of most eukaryotic messenger rnas, but difficulties in globally measuring poly(a)-tail lengths have impeded greater understanding of poly(a)-tail function.  poly(a) tails are critical for mrna stability and translation.  in the cytoplasm, the poly(a) tail promotes both mrna stability and translation, and these functions are frequently regulated through changes in tail length.  understanding the global regulation of poly(a) tail length will require dissecting the contributions of enzymes, regulatory factors, and poly(a) binding proteins (pabs) that all cooperate to regulate polyadenylation.  it measures poly(a) tail length from both native rna and dna sequencing, which makes poly(a) tail studies by full-length cdna approaches possible for the first time.  a segmented poly(a) tail is characterized in that it consists of at least two a-containing elements, each defined as a nucleotide sequence consisting of 40-60 adenosines, separated by a spacer element of different length. ||| ",Yes
"A bite from the Lone Star Tick Amblyomma americanum, can cause the victim to become allergic to red meat, yes or no?",Yes,"Recent studies have established a link between bites from the Lone Star Tick (Amblyomma americanum) and the development of red meat allergy. This allergy is mediated by the production of IgE antibodies against the carbohydrate galactose-α-1,3-galactose (α-gal), which is present in the tick's saliva. The tick bite triggers the production of these antibodies, leading to a hypersensitivity reaction upon subsequent consumption of red meat. This phenomenon has been observed globally, with the Lone Star Tick identified as a common vector. Therefore, it is accurate to state that a bite from the Lone Star Tick can cause the victim to become allergic to red meat.","recent studies revealed that amblyomma or ixodes tick bites may cause red meat allergy, in which galactose-α-1,3-galactose (α-gal) is a major ige-binding epitope.  because red meat allergy after tick bites is a worldwide phenomenon, the objectives of this review were to describe the global epidemiology of red meat allergy after tick bites and its immunological mechanisms; to identify the human risk factors for red meat allergy after tick bites; to identify the most common tick vectors of red meat allergy worldwide; to describe the clinical manifestations, diagnostic confirmation, and management of patients with red meat allergy after tick bites; and to recommend strategies for the prevention of tick bites.  red meat allergy after tick bites represents an emerging threat from tick bites in addition to infectious diseases.  these findings provide a potential mechanistic connection between amblyomma bites and red meat hypersensitivity.  we report the case of a 56-year-old farmer with a history of frequent lone star tick bites who presented with a 7-year history of diffuse urticaria occurring hours after eating red meat.  recently described conditions such as southern tick-associated rash illness and anaphylaxis to red meat following tick bites have been attributed to the lone star tick.  a syndrome of mammalian meat allergy relating to ige specific for galactose-α-1,3-galactose (α-gal) was first reported 10 years ago in the southeastern united states and has been related to bites of the lone star tick (amblyomma americanum).  the major risk factors for red meat allergy after tick bites included male sex, non-b blood type, systemic mastocytosis, a bioprosthetic (bovine or porcine) heart valve, and preexisting allergies to gelatin or animal dander.  therefore, we speculated that tick bites may cause these meat allergies.  delayed anaphylaxis to mammalian meat is a newly recognized ige-mediated syndrome associated with lone star tick bites.  the lone star tick, amblyomma americanum, feeds upon a variety of hosts and is a known vector of several human pathogens.  sensitization to tick salivary gland protein containing α-gal is possibly a major etiology of red meat allergy; the carbohydrate plays a crucial role in its allergenicity.  development of specific ige antibodies to the oligosaccharide galactose-α-1, 3-galactose (α-gal) following tick bites has been shown to be the source of red meat allergy.  commonly referred to as 'red meat allergy', α-gal syndrome is precipitated by a lone star tick bite resulting in the formation of immunoglobulin e (ige) antibodies against the tick salivary glycoproteins and noncatarrhine mammalian tissue.  in addition to being a major nuisance biter, the lone star tick, amblyomma americanum (l.), is increasingly recognized as an important vector of pathogens affecting humans, domestic animals, and wildlife.  alpha-gal allergy, also known as red meat allergy or alpha-gal syndrome, can present after bites of certain tick species that contain galactose-alpha-1,3-galactose (alpha-gal) carbohydrate.  this brief report aims to raise awareness that recurrent delayed anaphylactic reactions to food can develop after tick bites.  red meat allergies have followed tick bites on every continent except antarctica.  amblyomma americanum (the lone star tick) is a broadly distributed tick that transmits multiple pathogens of humans and domestic animals.  tick bites can cause the alpha-gal syndrome, which is characterized by delayed anaphylactic reactions mainly to red meat and offal due to ige antibodies against mammalian galactose-alpha-1.3-galactose carbohydrate (alpha-gal). ||| ",Yes
Are there any specific antidotes for rivaroxaban?,No,"Rivaroxaban is an oral direct factor Xa inhibitor that has been widely used in clinical practice for the prevention and treatment of thromboembolic disorders since 2008. Despite its numerous advantages over vitamin K antagonists, there are currently no specific antidotes available to reverse its anticoagulant effects. This lack of a specific antidote may increase the risk profile of patients with bleeding complications. Therefore, it is important to carefully manage patients receiving rivaroxaban who require urgent surgery or have a bleeding emergency.","rivaroxaban is an oral direct factor xa inhibitor developed for prophylaxis and treatment of thromboembolic disorders.  rivaroxaban, an oral, direct factor xa inhibitor, is one of the most used.  rivaroxaban is an oral direct factor xa inhibitor that has been marketed worldwide since 2008 for the primary and secondary prevention and treatment of thromboembolic disorders.  rivaroxaban, a factor xa inhibitor, is a new oral anticoagulant that has been developed as an alternative to vitamin k antagonists.  rivaroxaban is an oral, direct factor xa inhibitor, approved for the prevention and treatment of several thromboembolic disorders.  rivaroxaban is a novel xa inhibitor with an encouraging anti-thrombosis effect.  rivaroxaban is a direct oral anti-factor xa anticoagulant.  rivaroxaban is an oral direct factor xa inhibitor that is noninferior to warfarin in the prevention of recurrent venous thromboembolism (vte).  at present no antidote is appointed and no guidelines have been formulated for the measurement of rivaroxaban reversal.  rivaroxaban, a novel oral anticoagulant drug, is widely used in clinical practice.  rivaroxaban is a once-daily oral anticoagulant currently indicated for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation.  despite several advantages of the novel anticoagulant rivaroxaban compared with vitamin k antagonists (vka), its lack of specific antidotes to reverse anticoagulant effects may increase the risk profile of patients with bleeding complications.  rivaroxaban is the first licensed oral direct inhibitor of factor xa.  rivaroxaban is a united states food and drug administration-approved oral anticoagulant for venous thromboembolic disease; however, there is no information regarding the safety and its efficacy to support its use in patients after open or endovascular arterial interventions.  in summary, prophylactic anticoagulation with rivaroxaban appears to be a cost effective, and perhaps cost saving, alternative to warfarin for the prevention of recurrent vte.  the management of patients treated with rivaroxaban who require urgent surgery is discussed in this report.  rivaroxaban and dabigatran are new oral anticoagulants that specifically inhibit factor xa and thrombin, respectively.  rivaroxaban has been approved as an antithrombotic agent for prevention of venous thromboembolism with specific indications.  here, we explore the management strategies in patients receiving rivaroxaban who have a bleeding emergency or require emergency surgery.  reported randomized controlled trials comparing the safety of rivaroxaban with that of vitamin k antagonists (warfarin, acenocoumarol, phenprocoumon, and fluindione) were systematically searched. ||| ",No
Is DNA methylation correlated with nucleosome occupancy?,Yes,"The results indicate that an increase in methylated CpG density is correlated with nucleosome occupancy in the total genome and within nearly all subgenomic regions. This suggests that DNA methylation may facilitate nucleosome formation, providing a mechanism for alterations in chromatin density. Furthermore, the density of CpGs within nucleosomes has been shown to be important for the nucleosomal location of DNA methylation. Features with elevated methylated CpG density, such as exons and methylated CpG islands, are among the highest nucleosome occupied elements in the genome. Conversely, unmethylated CpG islands and unmethylated transcription factor binding sites display some of the lowest occupancies. These findings support the correlation between DNA methylation and nucleosome occupancy.","thus, the relationship between dna methylation and nucleosome occupancy is influenced by the density of methylated cpg dinucleotides and by other epigenomic components in chromatin.  the results demonstrated that increasing methylated cpg density is correlated with nucleosome occupancy in the total genome and within nearly all subgenomic regions.  we hypothesize that the methylation-induced properties or conformational changes in dna may facilitate nucleosome formation, which provides the essential mechanism for alterations of chromatin density.  recent mapping of nucleosome positioning on several long gene regions subject to dna methylation has identified instances of nucleosome repositioning by this base modification.  additionally, outside of cpg islands, the density of cpgs within nucleosomes was shown to be important for the nucleosomal location of dna methylation with low cpg frequencies favoring linker methylation and high cpg frequencies favoring core particle methylation.  dna methylation is a potential source of disease biomarkers.  in this study, we make progress toward understanding these conflicting phenomena by implementing a bioinformatics approach that combines mnase-seq and nome-seq data and by comprehensively profiling dna methylation and nucleosome occupancy throughout the human genome.  unmethylated islands are related with transcriptionally active structure, whereas methylated dna recruits methyl-binding proteins that promotes chromatin compaction.  however, the debate on whether or not dna methylation is a reliable indicator of high nucleosome occupancy has not been settled.  methylation of cytosine residues in eukaryotic dna is common, but poorly understood.  the effects of dna methylation on transcription and chromatin structure require that nuclear factors be able to distinguish methylated and nonmethylated dna.  recent studies have revealed that local dna methylation profiles might be dictated by cis-regulatory dna sequences that mainly operate via dna-binding factors.  finally, methylation is more frequent in the presence of at repeats and cpgs separated by 10 nucleotides and lower in adjacent cpgs, probably indicating its dependence on helical formations and on the presence of nucleosome positioning-related sequences.  the evidence for an effect of cpg methylation on nucleosome formation and positioning in chromatin is reviewed here in the context of the complex sequence-structure requirements of dna wrapping around the histone octamer and the role of this epigenetic mark in gene repression.  dna methylation is an epigenetic modification that is enriched in heterochromatin but depleted at active promoters and enhancers.  features with elevated methylated cpg density such as exons, sine-alu sequences, h3k36-trimethylated peaks, and methylated cpg islands are among the highest nucleosome occupied elements in the genome, while some of the lowest occupancies are displayed by unmethylated cpg islands and unmethylated transcription factor binding sites.  variation in cytosine methylation at cpg dinucleotides is often observed in genomic regions, and analysis typically focuses on estimating the proportion of methylated sites observed in a given region and comparing these levels across samples to determine association with conditions of interest.  dna methylation is characterized by the addition of methyl groups in cytosines within cpg islands.  these results suggest that methylation increases dna rigidity in the cg context and introduces distortions into several chg and chh sequences.  the methylation frequency increases in sequences containing multiple putative eses. ||| ",Yes
Has protein citrullination been implicated in rheumatoid arthritis?,Yes,"Protein citrullination has been implicated in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) as evidenced by the increased protein citrullination observed in the inflamed rheumatoid joint. This posttranslational modification has attracted attention for its involvement in RA, with several proteins, including collagen type II, fibrinogen, and fibronectin, being citrullinated in RA. The presence of autoantibodies and autoreactive T cells to citrullinated proteins and citrullinating enzymes in RA patients, along with the accumulation of citrullinated proteins in rheumatoid joints, provides substantial evidence that dysregulated citrullination is a hallmark feature of RA. The generation of anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPAs) has been suggested to contribute to RA development. However, the molecular mechanisms driving protein citrullination in RA patients remain poorly understood.","the importance of citrullination in rheumatoid arthritis (ra) has been reported, but the degree to which individual citrullinated proteins affect the onset and progression of ra is still unclear.  anti-citrullinated protein antibodies have been detected with high specificity in serum of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (ra), and citrullination of proteins may play a key role in the pathogenesis of ra.  in the inflamed rheumatoid joint there is increased protein citrullination.  protein citrullination is a posttranslational modification that has attracted increased attention, especially for its involvement in rheumatoid arthritis (ra).  protein citrullination is present in the rheumatoid synovium, presumably contributing to the perpetuation of chronic inflammation, in the presence of specific autoimmunity.  the presence of autoantibodies and autoreactive t cells to citrullinated proteins and citrullinating enzymes in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (ra), together with the accumulation of citrullinated proteins in rheumatoid joints, provides substantial evidence that dysregulated citrullination is a hallmark feature of ra.  several proteins are citrullinated in rheumatoid arthritis, including collagen type ii, fibrinogen, and fibronectin.  anti-citrullinated protein antibodies have a diagnostic role in rheumatoid arthritis (ra); however, little is known about their origins and contribution to pathogenesis.  autoantibodies against citrullinated proteins are diagnostic for rheumatoid arthritis.  we explored the expression of citrullinated proteins in joints and sera of experimental arthritis, and we further investigated their specific expression correlated with the disease activity in patients with ra.  anticitrullinated protein antibodies (acpa) and citrullinated proteins play key roles in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (ra).  citrullination, the post-translational conversion of arginines to citrullines, may contribute to rheumatoid arthritis development given the generation of anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (acpas).  anti-citrullinated protein antibodies are pathologic in rheumatoid arthritis, but the role of the citrullinated proteins themselves is much less clear.  autoantibodies to citrullinated protein antigens are specific markers of rheumatoid arthritis (ra).  however, the molecular mechanisms driving protein citrullination in patients with rheumatoid arthritis remain poorly understood.  protein citrullination catalyzed by peptidyl arginine deiminase (pads) is involved in autoimmune disease pathogenesis, especially in rheumatoid arthritis.  to address the ongoing debate concerning the specificity of synovial citrullinated proteins for rheumatoid arthritis (ra) and to analyze their pathophysiologic relevance to the induction or perpetuation of the ra-specific anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (acpas).  dysregulated citrullination is a key element that drives the production and maintenance of antibodies to citrullinated proteins, a hallmark in rheumatoid arthritis (ra).  citrullinated proteins were detected specifically in arthritic joints and sera from pgia relative to controls.  this work suggests an important role for the interaction of synovial fibroblasts with citrullinated matrix in the pathophysiology of rheumatoid arthritis. ||| ",Yes
Does temsirolimus improve survival of glioblastoma patients?,No,"Evidence

     The provided context does not contain information regarding the impact of temsirolimus on the survival of glioblastoma patients. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the effect of temsirolimus on the survival of glioblastoma patients based solely on the given context. The context primarily discusses the use of temozolomide, radiation therapy, and other treatments for glioblastoma, but does not mention temsirolimus. Further research and evidence are required to establish the impact of temsirolimus on the survival of glioblastoma patients.","the survival of patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma improved from 2000-2003 to 2005-2008, likely due to temozolomide use.  alternative dosing schedules of temozolomide may improve survival in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma (gbm) by increasing the therapeutic index, overcoming common mechanisms of temozolomide resistance, or both.  standard treatment with temozolomide and radiotherapy for patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma has increased the median overall survival and, more importantly, the 2-year survival rate of patients.  radiation therapy oncology group trial 0525 tested whether dose-intensifying temozolomide versus standard chemoradiotherapy improves overall survival (os) or progression-free survival (pfs) in newly diagnosed glioblastoma.  currently, several clinical trials of dose-dense temozolomide regimen or molecular-targeting therapies have been performed to overcome the resistance of glioblastoma.  temozolomide (tmz), given concurrently with radiotherapy (rt) and as adjuvant monotherapy afterwards, has led to improved survival in glioblastoma multiforme (gbm).  however, with aggressive surgical resection, radiation, and the advent of temozolomide, the overall survival of patients with glioblastomas has improved significantly.  temozolomide-based chemotherapy represents an incremental improvement in the treatment of patients with high-grade gliomas.  notwithstanding a survival benefit in a subset of patients with high-grade gliomas, temozolomide (tmz; temodar®, schering-plough pharmaceuticals, nj, usa) is the primarily palliative treatment for the vast majority of patients.  combined temozolomide and radiotherapy (rt) is the standard postoperative therapy for glioblastoma multiforme (gbm).  combined therapy with temozolomide and radiotherapy is a standard treatment and improves the survival for patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma.  a recent randomized study conducted on newly diagnosed glioblastoma (gbm) patients demonstrated that concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide added to standard radiotherapy had a survival advantage compared with radiotherapy alone.  second-line treatment with continuous dose-intense tmz may prolong survival in patients with recurrent glioblastoma.  the aim of this study is to offer survival following reirradiation (re-rt) using intensity-modulated radiation therapy (imrt) with temozolomide in selected patients with recurrent high grade gliomas.  temozolomide is recommended as superior to procarbazine in patients with first relapse of glioblastoma after having received nitrosourea chemotherapy or no prior cytotoxic chemotherapy at the time of initial therapy.  laboratory and clinical data suggest that the anti-angiogenic agent, thalidomide, if combined with cytotoxic agents, may be effective against recurrent glioblastoma multiforme (gbm).  what is the impact of cytotoxic chemotherapy on disease control and survival in the adult patient with progressive glioblastoma?  we performed a retrospective review of 67 patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma treated with rt/tmz between 2003-2007.  we identified patients with histologically confirmed glioblastoma and world health organization grade iii glioma who were previously treated with temozolomide plus radiotherapy and received 10 mg/kg bevacizumab intravenous infusion every 2 weeks until disease progression for recurrent disease.  tumor-treating fields (ttfields) is an emerging treatment modality for glioblastoma (gbm). ||| ",No

Therefore, based on the current clinical trial data, progesterone is not effective for the treatment of patients with TBI.","to assess the effectiveness and safety of progesterone in people with acute traumatic brain injury (tbi).  progesterone has been shown to have neuroprotective effects in multiple animal models of brain injury, whereas the efficacy and safety in patients with traumatic brain injury (tbi) remains contentious.  the benefits of progesterone have been demonstrated in the animal models of traumatic brain injury (tbi).  progesterone is a potential neuroprotective drug to treat patients with traumatic brain injury.  in the present study we focused on the effect of progesterone treatment on structural and functional deficits in an experimental model of traumatic brain injury.  to conduct a meta-analysis to determine whether progesterone, compared with placebo or no treatment, influences mortality and neurologic outcome in traumatic brain injury (tbi).  the therapeutic use of progesterone following traumatic brain injury has recently entered phase iii clinical trials as a means of neuroprotection.  early treatment of moderate/severe traumatic brain injury (tbi) with progesterone does not improve clinical outcomes.  preclinical and clinical research findings have revealed that the hormone progesterone, when acutely administered, can dramatically reduce cerebral edema, inflammation, tissue necrosis, and programmed cell death following traumatic brain injury (tbi).  given after brain injury (tbi), progesterone reduces cerebral oedema and facilitates functional recovery.  previous studies suggest that progesterone may possess neuroprotective properties after traumatic insult but, with the exception of reduced formation of cerebral oedema, limited experimental evidence has been presented to support this claim.  although the administration of progesterone has been shown to be neuroprotective in experimental models of traumatic brain injury (tbi), the mechanisms for this beneficial effect are still poorly understood.  current clinical evidence from three small rcts indicates progesterone may improve the neurologic outcome of patients suffering tbi.  current clinical evidence from three small rcts indicates progesterone may improve the neurologic outcome of patients suffering tbi.  this study provides strong evidence that progesterone possesses neuroprotective properties in a mouse model of traumatic brain injury, but suggests that the steroid achieves this effect through mechanism(s) independent of the inflammatory response or growth factor up-regulation.  the administration of progesterone as a neuroprotective agent following traumatic brain injury has recently entered phase iii clinical trials.  two multi-centre phase iii clinical trials examining the protective potential of progesterone following traumatic brain injury have recently failed to demonstrate any improvement in outcome.  the failure of phase 3 clinical trials to demonstrate the cerebroprotective efficiency of progesterone in traumatic brain injury (tbi) patients emphasizes that different aspects of the design of both experimental and clinical studies should be reviewed and refined.  our data suggest that intranasal delivery of progesterone is a potential efficient, safe and non-stressful mode of administration that warrants evaluation for cerebroprotection in patients with brain injuries.  progesterone has been shown to be cerebroprotective in different experimental models of brain injuries and neurodegenerative diseases. ||| ",No
Can zinc finger nucleases be used to combat disease?,Yes,"Zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs) have been shown to be a promising tool for combating disease.

Does oculocutaneous albinism show an autosomal recessive inheritance?,Yes,"Oculocutaneous albinism (OCA) is a group of autosomal recessive disorders, as evidenced by multiple sources. These disorders result from mutations in genes associated with pigmentation, such as the tyrosinase gene (TYR) in OCA1.

Is SLC22A3 expressed in the brain?,Yes,"The context indicates that SLC22A3, also known as organic cation transporter 3 (OCT3), is expressed in the brain. The research has established the mRNA expression of SLC22A3 in various adult human brain regions. Furthermore, the effects of single nucleotide polymorphisms of SLC22A3 on the variability in SLC22A3 expression and sebum levels in humans have been examined. The segment of chromosome 22 containing the SLC22A3 gene is also thought to be involved in neurotransmitter metabolism in the central nervous system. Therefore, it can be concluded that SLC22A3 is expressed in the brain.","expression and immunostaining studies demonstrated that slc26a11 is abundantly expressed in the cerebellum, with a predominant expression in purkinje cells.  this research has established the mrna expression of syn iii in 22 adult human brain regions as well as the methylation specificity in the closest cpg island of this gene.  slc26a11 (human)/slc26a11 (mouse), also known as kidney brain anion transporter (kbat), is a member of the slc26 anion transporter family and shows abundant mrna expression in the brain.  thus, slc22a2 is associated with phenotypes of net tubular creatinine secretion and esrd.  co-immunofluorescent data showed that clc-3 is mainly distributed in a- and c-type nociceptive neurons.  we examined the effects of the single nucleotide polymorphisms ofslc22a3 on the variability in slc22a3 expression and sebum levels in humans.  slc6a3, which encodes the primary regulator of extracellular dopamine (da) concentration, the da transporter, has been implicated in schizophrenia (scz).  luciferase, knockdown, chromatin immunoprecipitation (chip), electrophoretic mobility shift assay were employed to investigate transcriptional regulation of slc22a3 expression.  slc22a14 is expressed specifically in male germ cells, and mice lacking the slc22a14 gene show severe male infertility.  slc22a23 is an orphan gene in the slc22 family of organic membrane transporters, and its single-nucleotide polymorphism rs17309827-t was recently nominally associated with intestinal inflammation in a genome-wide association study.  we conclude that slc26a11 (kbat) is prominently distributed in output neurons of various subcortical and cortical structures in the central nervous system, with specific expression in purkinje cells and that it may operate as a chloride channel regulating acid translocation by h⁺-atpase across the plasma membrane and in intracellular compartments.  the function of slc16a11 may be related to lipid metabolism.  solute carrier family 22 member 3 (slc22a3), also called organic cation transporter 3 (oct3), is responsible for organic cation transport, which can eliminate many endogenous small organic cations, drugs, and toxins.  this segment of chromosome 22 contains the sulfotransferase-4a1 (sult4a1) gene, which encodes an enzyme thought to be involved in neurotransmitter metabolism in the central nervous system.  as slc22a2 encodes the organic cation transporter 2 (oct2), the association might be due to an effect on tubular creatinine handling.  solute carrier (slc) 16a11 has been reported as a risk gene for type 2 diabetes (t2d).  the purpose of this candidate gene study was to identify a specificslc6a3activity associated with scz by using functional genetic approaches.  we previously identified solute carrier 22a14 (slc22a14) as a spermatogenesis-associated transmembrane protein in mice.  we found that patients with higher slc22a3 expression had longer survival times than those with lower slc22a3 expression (p = 0.051).  here, we show that slc22a14 is crucial for sperm motility and male fertility in mice. ||| ",Yes
Are there ultraconserved genomic regions in the budding yeast?,Yes,"Justification: The context indicates that many aspects of the genomes of yeast species in the family Saccharomycetaceae have been well conserved during evolution. Furthermore, it is noted that origin sequences, which represent functional protein-binding sites, are conserved better than the surrounding intergenic sequence within the genomes of closely related yeasts. This suggests the presence of ultraconserved genomic regions in the budding yeast.","fundamental aspects of eukaryotic molecular and cellular biology are extensively studied in the budding yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae.  genome maintenance pathways are highly conserved and research into a number of human genetic disorders with increased genome instability and cancer predisposition have benefited greatly from studies in budding yeast.  budding yeasts inhabit a range of environments by exploiting various metabolic traits.  the genome sequence of the budding yeast, saccharomyces cerevisiae, with a small genome size, unicellular growth, and rich history of genetic and molecular analyses was a milestone of early genomics in the 1990s.  the availability of genome sequences for a series of closely related (sensu stricto) budding yeasts has allowed us to take a 'comparative genomics' approach to this problem.  research on the budding yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae has yielded fundamental discoveries on highly conserved biological pathways and yeast remains the best-studied eukaryotic cell in the world.  we have studied the evolution of the yeast ribosomal dna unit to search for regions outside the rrna genes that exhibit evolutionary constraints and therefore might be involved in control of ribosome biosynthesis.  many aspects of the genomes of yeast species in the family saccharomycetaceae have been well conserved during evolution.  here we report on a marked telomeric sequence diversity within the budding yeast genus saccharomyces.  since they represent functional protein-binding sites, origin sequences are conserved better than the surrounding intergenic sequence within the genomes of closely related yeasts.  the budding yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae is a long-standing model for the three-dimensional organization of eukaryotic genomes.  our results indicate that different clades coexist at fine spatial scale and that population structure persists over at least a one-year interval in these wild yeasts, suggesting the efficacy of yearly sampling to follow longer term genetic dynamics in future studies.  here we performed an integrated approach of genome wide expression profiles of yeast at different time points, during growth and starvation.  a yeast gene usually have at most one intron.  we conducted an extensive analysis of the yeast genome to try to answer these questions.  past analyses of the genome of the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae have revealed substantial regional variation in g+c content.  to help understand the molecular evolution of these traits in yeasts, we created analyzing yeasts by reconstructing ancestry of homologs (aybrah), an open-source database of predicted and manually curated ortholog groups for 33 diverse fungi and yeasts in dikarya, spanning 600 million years of evolution.  here, we performed high-throughput chromosome conformation capture on diverged saccharomyces hybrid diploids to obtain the first global view of chromosome conformation in diploid yeasts.  in addition, we found ste12, xbp1 and tos8 as highly connected nodes in the subnetworks of ageing yeast.  the genome sequences provide a first glimpse into the genomic basis of the biological diversity of filamentous fungi and yeast. ||| ",Yes
Is CXCL7 a chemokine?,Yes,"CXCL7, also known as platelet basic protein, is a member of the CXC chemokine family. Chemokines are a group of small, secreted proteins that play a crucial role in the immune system by regulating the migration and activation of immune cells. CXCL7 is specifically known for its potent chemoattractant and activator functions for neutrophils, a type of white blood cell. It exerts its function by activating the CXC chemokine receptor 2 (CXCR2) and binding to sulfated glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) that regulate receptor activity. Furthermore, CXCL7 plays a crucial role in orchestrating neutrophil recruitment in response to vascular injury. Therefore, it can be concluded that CXCL7 is indeed a chemokine.","cxcl7 is a potent chemoattractant and activator of neutrophil function.  cxcr7 binds chemokines cxcl11 (i-tac) and cxcl12 (sdf-1) but does not act as a classical chemoattractant receptor.  cxcr7 ligands, such as the chemokine cxcl11 and the newly described synthetic molecule ccx771, may represent novel therapeutic opportunities for the control of such cells.  cx3cl1 is a unique chemokine that can exist in a soluble form, as a chemotactic cytokine, or in a membrane-attached form that acts as a binding molecule.  chemokine (c-c motif) ligand 7 (ccl7), a cc chemokine, is a chemotactic factor and attractant for various kinds of leukocytes, including monocytes and neutrophils.  c-x-c chemokine receptor 7 (cxcr7), a novel receptor of c-x-c motif chemokine ligand 12 (cxcl12), is associated with the occurrence and metastasis of various malignant tumours.  among more than 200 chemokines, cx3cl1 is a special chemotactic factor existing in both membrane-bound and soluble forms.  while most chemokines are members of the cc or cxc subgroups, xcl1, also known as lymphotactin, is the sole member of the c subgroup.  many cells, including leucocytes and stromal cells, express cxcl7, a member of the cxc chemokine family, also known as platelet basic protein.

Are OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 associated with bilirubin transport?,Yes,"The context indicates that OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 are organic anion-transporting polypeptides that function as sinusoidal membrane transporters, mediating liver uptake of various substrates, including conjugated and unconjugated bilirubin. Bilirubin elimination is a multifaceted process, and the uptake of bilirubin into hepatocytes is facilitated by OATP1B1 and OATP1B3. The context also mentions that OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 are involved in hepatic drug uptake and biliary elimination.

Are deletions of chromosomal regulatory boundaries associated with congenital disease?,Yes,"The context suggests that deletions of chromosomal regulatory boundaries can indeed be associated with congenital diseases. Chromosomal deletions, which can lead to the hemizygous loss of groups of contiguous genes, are a major cause of human congenital defects. These deletions can disrupt the normal expression of key developmental genes, leading to a number of developmental abnormalities. The context also mentions that apparently balanced chromosomal rearrangements in individuals with major congenital anomalies represent natural experiments of gene disruption and dysregulation. This further supports the idea that deletions of chromosomal regulatory boundaries can be associated with congenital diseases.","regulatory mutations that cause the misexpression of key developmental genes may underlie a number of developmental abnormalities.  complex chromosomal rearrangements and chromosomal deletion and duplication syndromes are commonly associated with abnormal clinical phenotypes.  chromosome deletions leading to the hemizygous loss of groups of contiguous genes are a major cause of human congenital defects.  chromosomal abnormalities are implicated in a substantial number of human developmental syndromes, but for many such disorders little is known about the causative genes.  apparently balanced chromosomal inversions may lead to disruption of developmentally important genes at the breakpoints of the inversion, causing congenital malformations.  chromosomal rearrangements causing microdeletions and microduplications are a major cause of congenital malformation and mental retardation.  small deletions and duplications frequently occur in the pericentromeric region of chromosomes and many of these are associated with developmental abnormalities.  most ocular abnormalities have occurred in patients with chromosomal defects.  chromosomal deletions and/or duplications are relatively common cytogenetic abnormalities.  alternately, some chromosomal syndromes may be caused by a deletion or duplication of a single gene with pleiotropic effects.  apparently balanced chromosomal rearrangements in individuals with major congenital anomalies represent natural experiments of gene disruption and dysregulation.  because many chromosomal alterations are large and encompass numerous genes, the ascertainment of individuals with overlapping deletions and varying clinical features may allow researchers to narrow the region in which to search for candidate genes.  identifying the genes that underlie the pathogenesis of chromosome deletion and duplication syndromes is a challenge because the affected chromosomal segment can contain many genes.  recurrent rearrangements of chromosome 1q21.1 that occur via non-allelic homologous recombination have been associated with variable phenotypes exhibiting incomplete penetrance, including congenital heart disease (chd).  the 2q31.1 deletion resulted in the loss of one copy of several known disease genes, including gad1, dcaf17, slc25a12 and itga6 associated with mental retardation and facial abnormalities and dlx1/dlx2 partially associated with limb abnormalities.  these findings show that duplication and deletion at chromosome 1q21.1 exhibit a degree of phenotypic specificity in chd, and implicate gja5 as the gene responsible for the chd phenotypes observed with copy number imbalances at this locus.  these developmental syndromes are conventionally attributed to abnormal expression of protein-coding genes in the affected region.  we found functional relationships among genes from three different duplicated chromosomal regions, reflecting interactions of protein-coding genes and their involvement in common cellular subnetworks.  contiguous gene syndromes are characterized by deletions or duplications of specific chromosomal segments involving clusters of single genes.  many patients suffering from developmental disorders harbor submicroscopic deletions or duplications that, by affecting the copy number of dosage-sensitive genes or disrupting normal gene expression, lead to disease. ||| ",Yes
Can NADPH oxidase be inhibited by apocynin and diphenylene iodonium?,Yes,"NADPH oxidase can indeed be inhibited by both apocynin and diphenylene iodonium (DPI). Apocynin is a well-known inhibitor of NADPH oxidase, acting through the inactivation of cytosolic fractions of the NADPH oxidase complex. Its inhibitory effect is closely related to the reactivity of its radicals with thiol groups. DPI, on the other hand, inhibits the activity of flavoenzymes, including NADPH oxidase, by preventing the interaction between two NADPH oxidase subunits, p47(phox) and p22(phox). Both inhibitors have been widely used in research and show promise as potential therapeutic agents.","redox processes are involved in the mechanism of action of nadph oxidase inhibitors such as diphenyleneiodonium and apocynin.  apocynin, or a (myelo)peroxidase-derived product thereof, is a powerful inhibitor of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (nadph) oxidase.  since the effect of apocynin has been correlated with inactivation of the cytosolic fractions of the nadph oxidase complex and its oxidation during the inhibitory process develops a special role in this process, we suggest that the close relationship between the reactivity of the radicals of mc-w compounds with thiol groups and their efficacy as nadph oxidase inhibitor could be the chemical pathway behind the mechanism of action of apocynin and should be taken into account in the design of new and specific nadph oxidase inhibitors.  apocynin has been widely used as an inhibitor of the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase (nadph-oxidase) system and shows promise as an anti-inflammatory drug.  enzymatic oxidation of apocynin, which may mimic in vivo metabolism, affords a large number of oligomers (apocynin oxidation products, aop) that inhibit vascular nadph oxidase.  diphenyleneiodonium (dpi) inhibits activity of flavoenzymes like nadph oxidase, the major source of superoxide anion in cardiovascular system, but affects also other oxidoreductases.  diphenyleneiodonium (dpi) has frequently been used to inhibit reactive oxygen species (ros) production mediated by flavoenzymes, particularly nad(p)h oxidase.  nadph oxidase is believed to be inhibited through prevention of the interaction between two nadph oxidase subunits, p47(phox) and p22(phox).  apocynin diminished these measures of oxidative stress and tnf-α.  loss of the cytochrome c reductase activity could be prevented by adrenodoxin, but not by nadp+.  the aim of this study was to assess whether apocynin, an nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (nadph) oxidase blocker, influences lipid peroxidation tbars, hydrogen peroxide (h2o2) content, protein level, heart edema, tumor necrosis factor α (tnf-α) concentration or the glutathione redox system in heart homogenates obtained from endothelin 1 (et-1)-induced oxidative stress rats.  here, we studied the structure-activity relationship for apocynin and analogous ortho-methoxy-substituted catechols as inhibitors of the nadph oxidase in neutrophils and their reactivity with peroxidase.  nadph and nadp+ stimulated inhibition.  the nadph-cytochrome c reductase activity of nadph-adrenodoxin reductase from nadph to cytochrome c via adrenodoxin was inhibited by pyridoxal 5'-phosphate and other reagents that modified the lysine residues.  thus, our observation that apocynin is a powerful inhibitor of platelet aggregation raises further questions about the selectivity of this drug as an nadph oxidase inhibitor.  our objective is to determine how apocynin, which is a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (nadph) oxidase inhibitor, protects the nonischemic control right lung (rl) from injury by the unilateral ischemic left lung (ll).  kinetic analysis indicated iodonium diphenyl to be an uncompetitive inhibitor of xanthine oxidase, suggesting the need for reduced enzyme for inhibition.  iodonium inhibition of the flavoenzymes neutrophil nadph oxidase and cytochrome p450 reductase has been suggested to require reductive metabolism of the inhibitor to a phenyl radical.  apocynin significantly decreased tbars (p < 0.001) and h2o2 (p < 0.05) level (vs. control) as well as improved protein level (p < 0.001) in the heart.  the administration of a high dose of apocynin inhibited nox2 expression and nox activity, reduced lipid peroxidation, suppressed the nf-κb pathway and subsequent pro-inflammatory cytokines transcription in the lung tissues, and attenuated lung injury during hs and resuscitation in rats. ||| ",Yes
"Are there studies representing the involvement of Notch mutations in neurodegenerative diseases such as Down syndrome, Pick's and Prion's disease, and cadasil syndrome?",Yes,"Justification: The context indicates that there are studies representing the involvement of Notch mutations in various neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, CADASIL, and other unspecified neurologic diseases associated with mental retardation or dementia. While Down syndrome, Pick's disease, and Prion's disease are not explicitly mentioned in the context, the inclusion of other neurodegenerative diseases suggests that there may be studies implicating Notch mutations in these diseases as well. The context also mentions that Notch signaling plays a critical role in dendrite development and that its dysregulation contributes to cognitive deficits associated with neurological diseases. This further supports the idea that Notch mutations may be involved in a range of neurodegenerative diseases.","on the other side, there are studies representing the involvement of notch mutations in sporadic alzheimer disease, other neurodegenerative diseases such as down syndrome, pick's and prion's disease, and cadasil.  deficits in the notch pathway are involved in a number of neurologic diseases associated with mental retardation or/and dementia.  the specific roles of notch in progressive adulthood neurodegenerative disorders have begun to be unraveled in recent years.  recently, notch receptors have been hypothesized to play a role in neurodegeneration and in particular in alzheimer's disease (notch1) and cadasil (notch3).  importantly, mutations of the notch protein and components of its signaling pathway have been implicated in an array of human diseases (t-cell leukemia and other cancers, multiple sclerosis, cadasil, alagille syndrome, spondylocostal dysostosis).  recent studies have identified notch signaling as a contributor of neurodegeneration including alzheimer's disease' (ad) pathophysiology.  these data indicate that notch signaling plays a critical role in dendrite development of immature neurons in the postnatal brain, and dysregulation of notch signaling in the postnatally born neurons disrupts their development and thus contributes to the cognitive deficits associated with neurological diseases.  this study identifies notch as a central signaling cascade capable of modulating synaptic transmission in response to excitatory insult through the activation of neuroprotective genes that have been associated to ad.  notch proteins are involved in cell fate specification during development in tissues including brain.  a number of independent studies have shown significant increases of notch expression in brains from patients at later stages of sporadic alzheimer's disease (ad).  the mechanisms by which notch dysregulation are associated with mental retardation and dementia are poorly understood.  this manuscript attempts to present a holistic view of the positive or negative contribution of notch signaling in the adult brain, and at the same time to present and promote the promising research fields of study.  notch genes are involved in embryogenesis, nervous system, and cardiovascular and endocrine function.  the notch signaling pathway is involved in a wide variety of highly conserved developmental processes in mammals.  as part of the efforts to understand molecular mechanisms and players involved in neurodegenerative dementia, we employed transgenic mouse models with notch1 and rbpjk loss of function (lof) mutation in pyramidal neurons of the ca fields.  as well, potential roles for glycosylation in notch-related human diseases, and possible roles for therapeutic targeting of pofut1 and fringe in notch-related human diseases, are discussed.  notch signaling is a master controller of the neural stem cell and neural development maintaining a significant role in the normal brain function.  recently, mutations causative for niemann-pick type c disease (npc) have also been implicated in neurodegenerative diseases.  we found that notch1 is highly expressed in the adult-born immature neurons in the hippocampus of mice.  several neurodegenerative diseases are known such as alzheimer's disease, parkinson's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and many studies on the molecular mechanisms underlying these pathologies have been conducted. ||| ",Yes
Are the proteins Erbin (LAP2) and Merlin cooperating?,No,"Merlin and Erbin (LAP2) are not the same proteins. Merlin is a member of the ERM (Ezrin, Radixin, Moesin) family of proteins, while Erbin (LAP2) is a member of the LAP (Leukocyte common antigen-related) protein family. Although both Merlin and Erbin (LAP2) are involved in regulating cell growth and cytoskeletal function, they do not cooperate in the same way as Merlin and ERM proteins. Merlin and ERM proteins share significant homology and have similar functions in providing regulated linkage between membrane-associated proteins and the actin cytoskeleton. However, the context does not provide any information on the cooperation between Merlin and Erbin (LAP2). Therefore, it cannot be concluded that Merlin and Erbin (LAP2) are cooperating.","to understand its physiological functions, we compared merlin with erm proteins in vivo and in vitro.  these findings do not favor the notion that merlin functions simply in a redundant or competitive manner to erm proteins.  merlin is highly homologous to the erm (ezrin-radixin-moesin) family of membrane/cytoskeleton linker proteins.  merlin, like the closely related erm proteins, appears to provide regulated linkage between membrane-associated proteins and the actin cytoskeleton and is therefore poised to function in receiving and interpreting signals from the extracellular milieu.  in this review we discuss how erm proteins and merlin are negatively regulated by an intramolecular association between their n- and c-terminal domains.  merlin, which shares significant homology with the actin-associated proteins ezrin, radixin and moesin (erm proteins), inhibits cell growth when overexpressed in cell lines.  merlin, the neurofibromatosis 2 tumor suppressor protein, has two major isoforms with alternate c termini and is related to the erm (ezrin, radixin, moesin) proteins.  the similarities between merlin and erm proteins suggest that merlin's growth-regulatory capabilities may be due to alterations in cytoskeletal function.  we also discuss membrane proteins to which erm and merlin bind, including those making an indirect linkage through the pdz-containing adaptor molecules ebp50 and e3karp.  merlin, the tumor suppressor in neurofibromatosis 2, is a diverged member of the ezrin family, but its function is at least partially similar to the erm proteins.  merlin, a neurofibromatosis type-2 tumor suppressor, shows significant sequence similarity to erm (ezrin/radixin/moesin) proteins, general actin filament/plasma membrane cross-linkers, which are regulated in a rho-dependent manner.  because merlin has high level of sequence similarity to the ezrin-radixin-moesin family of proteins, the structural model of ezrin-radixin-moesin protein autoinhibition and cycling between closed/resting and open/active conformational states is often employed to explain merlin function.  we have also explored the effect of merlin self-association on binding to the regulatory cofactor of na(+)-h(+) exchanger (nhe-rf), an interacting protein for merlin and the erms.  finally, we examined the binding affinity of merlin to rho gdp dissociation inhibitor (rho-gdi), to which n-terminal halves of erm proteins but not the full-length molecules specifically bind.  merlin, the product of the nf2 tumor suppressor gene, has sequence similarity to erm proteins and binds to some of the same membrane proteins, but lacks a c-terminal f-actin binding site.  in erm proteins and merlin, interdomain binding promotes auto-inhibition and homo-oligomerization or hetero-oligomerization.  merlin and ezrin proteins belong to the same gene family, i.e., merm containing merlin, ezrin radixin and moesin.  merlin and erm proteins were concentrated at microvilli when introduced into fibroblasts.  in vitro binding assays revealed that the n-terminal halves of merlin isoform-i and -ii as well as full-length merlin isoform-ii bound to rho-gdi with similar binding affinity to erm proteins.  to better understand the cellular functions of the nf2 gene product, merlin, recent work has concentrated on identifying proteins with which it interacts either physically or functionally. ||| ",Yes
Does HuR bind to the untranslated regions (UTRs) of mRNAs?,Yes,"Justification: HuR, an RNA-binding protein, has been reported to bind to adenine- and uridine-rich elements (AREs) in the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of target mRNAs. This binding regulates the stability and translation of the mRNAs, influencing the expression of genes involved in various cellular processes. The binding of HuR to AREs in the 3'-UTR of mRNAs is a conserved mechanism, with the Hur motif found in almost all previously reported Hur targets and conserved in over 50% of human and mouse homologous genes. Hur binding to AREs within the 3'-UTR of mRNAs encoding oncogenes, growth factors, and various cytokines has been shown to stabilize many of these mRNAs and/or modulate their translation.","hur is an rna-binding protein that resides predominantly in the nucleus but shuttles to the cytosol carrying mrnas containing a uridylate-rich region in the 3'untranslated region.  hur, an rna binding protein, binds to adenine- and uridine-rich elements (are) in the 3'-untranslated region (utr) of target mrnas, regulating their stability and translation.  hur is a ubiquitous, rna binding protein that influences the stability and translation of several cellular mrnas.  hur is a regulator of mrna turnover or translation of inflammatory genes through binding to adenylate-uridylate-rich elements and related motifs present in the 3'untranslated region (utr) of mrnas.  human antigen r (hur) is a rna-binding protein, which binds to the au-rich element (are) in the 3'-untranslated region (3'-utr) of certain mrna and is involved in the export and stabilization of are-mrna.  hur, a protein that binds to specific mrna subsets, is increasingly recognized as a pivotal posttranscriptional regulator of gene expression.  hur is an rna-binding protein of the embryonic lethal abnormal vision (elav) family, which binds to the au-rich element (are) in the 3'-untranslated region (utr) of certain mrnas and is involved in the nucleo-cytoplasmic export and stabilization of are-mrnas.  human antigen r (hur) is a multitasking rna binding protein involved in posttranscriptional regulation by recognizing adenine- and uracile-rich elements placed at the 3'-untranslated regions of messenger rnas (mrnas).  in the nucleus hur binds to mrnas containing adenylate-uridylate rich elements in the 3'-untranslated region.  the rna-binding protein hu antigen r (hur) binds to au-rich elements (are) in the 3'-untranslated region (utr) of target mrnas.  hur is a ligand for nuclear mrnas containing adenylate-uridylate-rich elements in the 3'-untranslated region.  hur is a ligand for nuclear mrnas containing adenylate-uridylate rich elements in the 3'-untranslated region.  this hur motif was found in almost all mrnas previously reported to be hur targets, was located preferentially within 3' untranslated regions of all unigene transcripts examined, and was conserved in >50% of human and mouse homologous genes.  hur is a ligand for nuclear mrnas containing adenylate-uridylate-rich (are) elements in the 3'-untranslated region.  hur may influence expression of its ligand mrna through regulation of polyadenylation, translocation of the message to the cytosol, stabilization of the mrna and/or altering its translational efficiency.  here, hur was immunoprecipitated under conditions that preserved hur-rna interactions, and hur-bound target mrnas were identified by cdna array hybridization.  rna-binding proteins hur and auf1 bind to many common au-rich target mrnas and exert opposing influence on target mrna stability, but the functional interactions between hur and auf1 have not been systematically studied.  here, we report a novel role for hur, as a regulator of proteins assembling at the 3' untranslated region (utr) of viral rna in the context of hepatitis c virus (hcv) infection.  hur binding to au-rich elements within the 3' untranslated region of mrnas encoding oncogenes, growth factors, and various cytokines leads message stability and translation.  hur was known to stabilize many of these mrnas and/or modulated their translation, but the molecular processes by which hur affected the fate of target mrnas was largely unknown. ||| ",Yes
Has single guide RNA been used on human cells?,Yes,"The context describes the use of single guide RNA in human cells for gene silencing and modulation of gene expression. The strategy involves harnessing an endogenous human RNA polymerase to produce small RNA hairpins from synthetic single-stranded DNA oligonucleotides. The single guide RNA strand is then processed by the Argonaute 2 protein to induce RNA interference. The use of external guide sequences, such as single 25-28-nucleotide oligos, has been shown to be effective in directing ribonuclease P to cleave target mRNAs in vitro. Furthermore, the potential for engineered egs RNAs to be developed and used as anti-HSV therapeutics has been demonstrated. These findings support the use of single guide RNA in human cells for therapeutic development and investigation of critical questions of mechanism.","these data expand the use of single-stranded rna to cell nuclei.  rnai using single-strand rna would provide new options for therapeutic development and for investigating critical questions of mechanism.  here we report findings supporting an alternative strategy in which an endogenous human rna polymerase (rnap) is harnessed to make rna hairpin-containing small rna from synthetic single-stranded dna oligonucleotides.  synthetic rna formulations and viral vectors are the two main approaches for delivering small therapeutic rna to human cells.  using chemically modified single-strands, we test the hypothesis that single-stranded rnas can engage the rnai pathway and silence gene transcription.  an external guide sequence (egs) is a rna sequence which can interact with a target mrna to form a tertiary structure like a pre-trna and recruit intracellular ribonuclease p (rnase p), a trna processing enzyme, to degrade target mrna.  external guide sequences (egss) are rna molecules that can bind to a target mrna and direct ribonuclease p (rnase p), a trna processing enzyme, for specific cleavage of the target mrna.  this finding enables the design of highly effective single-oligo compounds for any mrna target.  we designed an alternative shrna molecule with a relatively short base-paired stem that bypasses dicer and instead is processed by the argonaute 2 (ago2) protein into a single guide rna strand that effectively induces rnai.  the introduction of 21-23 nucleotide rna duplexes, termed small interfering rnas (sirnas), into mammalian cells can specifically degrade homologous mrnas.  rna is considered a highly promising candidate for several applications such as gene knock-down, gene repair and gene therapy, where double-stranded rna and rna with catalytic activity are key players.  hyperstable u1snrna might be a novel approach to express effective antisense rna in target cells.  using an in vitro selection procedure, we have previously generated egs variants that efficiently direct human rnase p to cleave a target mrna in vitro.  here we describe a novel class of rnai molecules composed of a single 25-28-nucleotide (nt) oligo.  in this study, we utilised u1 small nuclear rna (snrna) that binds physiologically to the 5' splice site (5'ss) of pre-mrna, to develop a novel vector system that permits imposed binding of antisense rna to its target.  previously, an in vitro selection procedure has been used by us to engineer new egss that are more robust in inducing human rnase p to cleave their targeted mrnas.  nucleic acid-based gene interfering approaches, such as those mediated by rna interference and rnase p-associated external guide sequence (egs), have emerged as promising antiviral strategies.  furthermore, these results demonstrate the potential for engineered egs rnas to be developed and used as anti-hsv therapeutics.  rna interference (rnai) has been established as an important tool for functional genomics studies and has great promise as a therapeutic intervention for human diseases.  ribonuclease p (rnase p) complexed with external guide sequence (egs) represents a novel nucleic acid-based gene interference approach to modulate gene expression. ||| ",Yes
Does the word ovine refers to goats?,No,"Justification: The term ""ovine"" is derived from the Latin word ""ovis"", which means sheep. In the context of veterinary medicine and animal science, ""ovine"" is used to refer specifically to sheep and their related aspects, such as diseases, parasites, and anatomical features. In contrast, ""caprine"" is the term used to refer to goats and their related aspects. Therefore, the word ""ovine"" does not refer to goats, but rather to sheep.","the goat is an important farm animal.  the domestic goat (capra hircus), an important livestock species, belongs to a clade of ruminantia, bovidae, together with cattle, buffalo and sheep.  the ovary is the most important reproductive organ for goats.  in the usa, goats are primarily infected with bovine strains of paratuberculosis and sheep are primarily infected with ovine strains.  reproduction is an important process of goat farming.  however, in contrast to cattle, there is a lack of reference information on this topic in goats.  during the spring of 2 years, goat kids grazed on a cattle pasture acquired o. ostertagi infections which included adult worms, but a larger number of early l4.  active omasal motility was recorded in 20 goats with 0.3 to 2.0 contractions per minute.  goats offer benefits compared to cattle because of size and tractability and compared to sheep with regard to specific features of their anatomy.  the findings of this study provide reference ranges for the interpretation of the location and size of the omasum in goats with suspected omasal abnormalities.  the aim of this research reflection is to describe the basic rumen function of goats and its modification in response to environmental factors, as well as to discuss similarities and differences when compared to other ruminants.  this is the first reportedly molecular detection of m. ovis infection in goats from south america.  the present study was designed to investigate the possibility that the goat oviduct produces specific substance(s) similar to the oviductal glycoprotein (bogp) of the bovine oviduct.  in conclusion, m. ovis is highly prevalent in goats from northeastern brazil, mainly in dairy animals.  however, in the developed world (eg, the european union and much of north america), the value of goats relates to its select ability to produce high yields of milk and the increased returns associated with the dairy products, particularly artisanal cheeses.  goats also differ from other ruminants by their enhanced ability to feed-sort, but as with cows they can suffer from acidosis.  the commonly used description of the goat as the ""cow of the poorest"" underlines its importance for small farmers.  in so doing we shall reveal the adaptive capacity of goats to harsh environments.  in relation to host-specific parasites, such as eimeria spp., goats cannot be considered as a source for sheep, but competition for food and spaces between both small ungulates can suppose a reduced grazing area to sheep, provoking high environmental contamination and stress that facilitate their infection.  goat contact was a risk factor for sheep to be infected by protostrongylids, dictyocaulus filaria, gastrointestinal nematodes and eimeria spp. ||| ",No
Does ziconotide bind to N-type calcium channels?,Yes,"Justification: Ziconotide, a synthetic peptide, is a selective and potent blocker of N-type voltage-sensitive calcium channels.

Are there mammalian promoters with distal enhancer functions?,Yes,"Justification: The context suggests that there are indeed mammalian promoters with distal enhancer functions. These promoters, termed epromoters, have been shown to work as bona fide enhancers and regulate distal gene expression. The context also mentions that some enhancers can act as weak promoters, producing overlapping spatio-temporal expression. This further supports the notion that promoters can have distal enhancer functions.","in the human genome, distal enhancers are involved in regulating target genes through proximal promoters by forming enhancer-promoter interactions.  distal regulatory elements, including enhancers, play a critical role in regulating gene activity.  mammalian gene regulation is often mediated by distal enhancer elements, in particular, for tissue specific and developmental genes.  gene expression in mammals is precisely regulated by the combination of promoters and gene-distal regulatory regions, known as enhancers.  several studies have suggested that some promoters might have enhancer functions.  here, by exploiting a high-throughput enhancer reporter assay, we unravel a set of mammalian promoters displaying enhancer activity.  our previous results demonstrated that a subset of gene promoters, termed epromoters, work as bona fide enhancers and regulate distal gene expression.  enhancers are distal regulatory elements that can activate tissue-specific gene expression and are abundant throughout mammalian genomes.  gene expression is controlled by the involvement of gene-proximal (promoters) and distal (enhancers) regulatory elements.  however, the extent of this type of promoters and whether they actually function to regulate the expression of distal genes have remained elusive.  we note differences among four tested enhancers in their ability to regulate a distally placed reporter transgene.  enhancers are traditionally viewed as dna sequences located some distance from a promoter that act in cis and in an orientation-independent fashion to increase utilization of specific promoters and thereby regulate gene expression.  enhancers and promoters, cis-acting regulators of mammalian gene expression, are modular units containing multiple short binding sites for specific trans-acting transcription factors.  some enhancers (mainly bidirectional) can act as weak promoters, producing overlapping spatio-temporal expression.  these elements typically reside distal to their target promoter, with which they must interact selectively.  both enhancers and promoters are composed of multiple binding sites for transcription factors.  a distal transcriptional enhancer has been previously reported upstream of the mouse renin gene.  these results suggest that enhancers differ in their requirements for promoter interaction and raise important practical considerations when studying enhancer function.  gene transcription in animals involves the assembly of rna polymerase ii at core promoters and its cell-type-specific activation by enhancers that can be located more distally.  enhancers activate gene transcription in spatial and temporal patterns by interactions with gene promoters. ||| ",Yes
Is Lysyl oxidase crosslinking collagen?,Yes,"Justification: Lysyl oxidase, an extracellular copper-dependent enzyme, plays a critical role in the crosslinking of collagen and elastin.

This process is essential for the maturation and stabilization of collagen fibers, contributing to the tensile strength and structural integrity of the extracellular matrix.","lysyl oxidase (ec 1.4.3.13) initiates the crosslinking of collagens and elastin by catalyzing oxidative deamination of the epsilon-amino group in certain lysine and hydroxylysine residues.  covalent intermolecular cross-linking of collagen is initiated by the action of lysyl oxidase (lox) on the telopeptidyl lysine and hydroxylysine residues.  lysyl oxidase initiates cross-linkage of collagen and elastin by catalysing the formation of a lysine-derived aldehyde.  the generation of covalent cross-linkages in collagen is initiated by the deamination by lysyl oxidase of specific lysine residues in this connective tissue protein.  background collagen cross-linking is covalent bonds among collagen fibers from catalysis of lysyl oxidase (lox) and advanced glycation end products (ages).  lysyl oxidase is an extracellular matrix, copper - dependent amine oxidase that catalyzes a key enzymatic step in the crosslinking of collagen and elastin.  lysyl oxidase (lo) is an extracellular copper-dependent enzyme that catalyzes the initial reaction in the formation of lysine or hydroxylysine-derived crosslinks during collagen biosynthesis.  lysyl oxidase catalyzes the final known enzymatic step required for collagen and elastin cross-linking.  lysyl oxidase-like 2 (loxl2) belongs to the family of lysyl oxidases, and as such promotes crosslinking of collagens and elastin by oxidative deamination of lysine residues.  intra- and intermolecular covalent cross-linking between collagen fibrils, catalyzed by lysyl oxidase (lox), determines the mechanical properties of connective tissues; however, mechanisms that regulate the collagen cross-linking according to tissue specificity are not well understood.  lysyl oxidase-like-2 (loxl2) is an enzyme secreted into the extracellular matrix that crosslinks collagens by mediating oxidative deamination of lysine residues.  lysyl oxidase (lox) initiates the crosslinking of the lysine-derived aldehyde and plays an essential role in maturation of collagen, for example in wound healing.  lysyl oxidase (lox) family oxidases, lox and loxl1-4, oxidize lysine residues in collagens and elastin, resulting in the covalent crosslinking and stabilization of these extracellular matrix (ecm) structural components, thus provide collagen and elastic fibers much of their tensile strength and structural integrity.  lysyl oxidase (lox) cross-links the side chain of collagen and elastin and thereby contributes to extracellular matrix (ecm) integrity.  lysyl oxidase (lo) plays a critical role in the formation and repair of the extracellular matrix (ecm) by oxidizing lysine residues in elastin and collagen, thereby initiating the formation of covalent crosslinkages which stabilize these fibrous proteins.  lysyl-oxidase-like 2 (loxl2) is a member of the lysyl oxidase family that catalyzes the cross-linking of collagens or elastins in the extracellular matrix, thus regulating the tensile strength of tissues.  lysyl oxidase (ec 1.4.3.13) oxidizes peptidyl lysine to peptidyl aldehyde residues within collagen and elastin, thus initiating formation of the covalent cross-linkages that insolubilize these extracellular proteins.  collagen cross-link and deposition depend on lysyl hydroxylation, which is catalyzed by procollagen-lysine, 2-oxoglutarate 5-dioxygenase (plod).  introduction: enzymatic cross-linking of the collagens within the extracellular matrix (ecm) catalyzed by enzymes such as lysyl oxidase (lox) and lysyl oxidase like-enzymes 1-4 (loxl), transglutaminase 2 (tg2), and peroxidasin (pxdn) contribute to fibrosis progression through extensive collagen cross-linking.  lysyl oxidase (lox) is a copper-dependent enzyme that initiates covalent crosslinking of elastin precursors by oxidizing peptidyl lysine to aminoadipic semi-aldehydes. ||| ",Yes
Is there any tool that facilitates the functional analysis of cis-regulatory regions in zebrafish?,No,"The context does not provide explicit information on the existence of a tool that specifically facilitates the functional analysis of cis-regulatory regions in zebrafish. However, it does mention the use of microarray analysis for studying the temporal activity of developmentally regulated genes during zebrafish embryogenesis, as well as the use of proteomics and mass spectrometry for functional studies. It also highlights the potential of the zebrafish as a model system for the analysis of vertebrate embryogenesis and organ development, and its utility in understanding the functional interaction between subtle gene defects. Despite these advances, the context does not indicate the availability of a tool for the functional analysis of cis-regulatory regions in zebrafish.","here we provide, for the first time to our knowledge, a comprehensive list of developmentally regulated zebrafish genes and their expression profiles during embryogenesis, including novel information on the temporal expression of several thousand previously uncharacterized genes.  to exploit fully the power of the zebrafish system as a model for vertebrate development, it will be necessary to develop efficient tools for genomic analysis.  the zebrafish has recently emerged as a useful system for understanding vertebrate developmental genetics, despite the lack of a linkage map.  the zebrafish is widely used for functional studies of vertebrate genes.  this approach can be used for the functional analysis of the late role of developmental genes in the neural tube of zebrafish embryo and larvae.  here we have employed microarray analysis to study the temporal activity of developmentally regulated genes during zebrafish embryogenesis.  the technique described offers a guide that will provide innovative and broad opportunities to beginner students and researchers who are interested in the functional analysis of neuronal activity, plasticity, and neural development in the zebrafish brain.  despite the extensive use of zebrafish as a model organism in developmental biology and regeneration research, genetic techniques enabling conditional analysis of gene function are limited.  the zebrafish is a powerful model vertebrate amenable to high throughput in vivo genetic analyses.  the rapid development of zebrafish embryos provides opportunities for investigation of genes essential for developmental processes, the human counterparts of which might be implicated in diseases.  zebrafish (danio rerio) is a well-recognized model for the study of vertebrate developmental genetics, yet at the same time little is known about the transcriptional events that underlie zebrafish embryogenesis.  this brief review summarizes features of the zebrafish, danio rerio, that make it a suitable model organism for studies of regulatory physiology.  such methodologies promise to enable new zebrafish models for interrogating human physiology and disease.  here, we provide detailed protocols for proteomics in zebrafish from sample preparation to mass spectrometry (ms), including a comparison of databases for ms identification of zebrafish proteins.  finally, the review provides examples of functional studies in zebrafish, including studies in sensory neurons, cardiac rhythm disturbances, gastrointestinal function, and studies of the developing kidney, that illustrate potential applications.  to facilitate analysis of the zebrafish genome, genetic maps have been constructed and sequence annotation of a reference zebrafish genome is ongoing.  zebrafish (d. rerio) has become a powerful and widely used model system for the analysis of vertebrate embryogenesis and organ development.  the zebrafish has emerged as a new model system in behavioral neurobiology research.  because of the relative ease with which combinatorial studies can be performed, the zebrafish may eventually be particularly valuable in understanding the functional interaction between subtle gene defects that cause polygenic disorders.  analysis of the zebrafish allows one to combine two distinct scientific approaches, comparative ethology and neurobehavioral genetics. ||| ",Yes
Can nanoparticles be used for afterglow imaging?,Yes,"Afterglow nanoparticles have been extensively studied for their potential applications in cancer imaging and photodynamic therapy. These particles, which emit light after irradiation with an excitation source, have been demonstrated to be effective for both anatomic and molecular imaging. The use of afterglow nanoparticles in imaging offers several advantages, including the elimination of tissue autofluorescence and the ability to achieve ultrasensitive in vivo imaging. Additionally, afterglow-magnetic nanoparticles can be manipulated by a magnetic field, further expanding their potential applications in bioimaging. However, challenges remain in the development of afterglow nanoparticles, including the need for improved brightness and longer near-infrared emission. Despite these challenges, the use of afterglow nanoparticles in imaging holds great promise for the development of new diagnostic and therapeutic agents for cancer treatment.","afterglow nanoparticles have been widely investigated as new agents for cancer imaging and as a light source for photodynamic activation for cancer treatment.  the applications of afterglow particles for photodynamic activation and biological imaging have become a topical research area.  water-soluble red afterglow imaging agents based on ecofriendly nanomaterials have potential application in time-gated afterglow bioimaging due to their larger penetration depth and nondurable excitation.  afterglow-magnetic nanoparticles (nps) offer enormous potential for bioimaging applications, as they can be manipulated by a magnetic field, as well as emitting light after irradiation with an excitation source, thus distinguishing themselves from fluorescent living cells.  however, afterglow imaging has been limited by its reliance on inorganic nanoparticles with relatively low brightness and short-near-infrared (nir) emission.  time-gated in vivo afterglow imaging has been demonstrated by using the cnds-rhb@silica as afterglow agents.  nanoparticles are a new class of imaging agent used for both anatomic and molecular imaging.  afterglow optical agents, which emit light long after cessation of excitation, hold promise for ultrasensitive in vivo imaging because they eliminate tissue autofluorescence.  for both applications, the targeting of the afterglow nanoparticles to tumor cells is an important and challenging issue.  nanoparticles are widely used as contrast and therapeutic agents.  nanoparticles are attracting considerable interest as contrast agents for many different imaging modalities.  afterglow luminescent probes with high signal-to-background ratio show promise for in vivo imaging; however, such probes that can be selectively delivered into target sites and switch on afterglow luminescence remain limited.  herein, red afterglow imaging agents consisted of rhodamine b (rhb) and carbon nanodots (cnds) have been designed and demonstrated.  the ability to quantitatively and non-invasively image nanoparticles has important implications for the development of nanoparticles as in vivo cancer diagnostic and therapeutic agents.  all these results indicate the methods reported here for afterglow nanoparticle synthesis, coating and conjugation are successful, and consequently, the prepared sr2mgsi2o7:eu2+, dy3+/ppix/folic acid nano-conjugates are promising for x-ray induced photodynamic therapy on cancer treatment.  these results indicated that it is feasible to use solid nanoparticles as contrast enhancing agents for ultrasonic imaging.  owing to their unique afterglow ability, long-wavelength light activatable persistent luminescence (persl) nanoparticles (plnps) have been emerging as an important category of imaging probes.  nanoparticles have drawn great attention as targeted imaging and/or therapeutic agents.  persistent luminescence nanoparticles (plnps) with rechargeable near-infrared afterglow properties attract much attention for tumor diagnosis in living animals since they can avoid tissue autofluorescence and greatly improve the signal-to-background ratio.  as for r11-sh peptide, cellular uptake of the afterglow nanoparticles was observed on lncap and pc3 prostate cancer cell lines. ||| ",Yes
Does strenuous physical activity affect thyroid hormone metabolism?,Yes,"Strenuous physical activity has been shown to induce changes in thyroid hormone metabolism, although the extent and impact of these changes remain controversial. Studies have reported transient alterations in thyroid hormone levels during intense exercise, which may reflect the relative negative energy balance during strenuous activity. However, these changes are generally considered to be minor and of limited clinical significance. Nonetheless, adequate caloric intake is recommended for highly performing young athletes to maintain endocrine-metabolic balance. Additionally, corticosteroids have been implicated in the maintenance of serum thyroid hormone levels after high-intensity exercise, as blocking corticosterone synthesis has been shown to result in lower serum T3 and T4 levels. Overall, while the impact of strenuous exercise on thyroid hormone metabolism is complex and not fully understood, it is clear that physical activity can induce changes in thyroid function.","thyroid hormones may influence physical activity levels.  maximal aerobic exercise greatly affects the level of circulating thyroid hormones.  exercise training may cause changes in thyroid function.  thyroid hormones are important regulators of energy metabolism and may influence energy processes during physical exercise.  there are controversial results concerning thyroid hormone metabolism during strenuous exercise in adult athletes and only scant data concerning the impact of strenuous exercise on thyroid hormone metabolism in children and adolescents.  the objective was to evaluate whether a physical exercise session alters the thyroid economy and adrenal axis in humans, and the possible role of corticosteroids in thyroid function disturbance.  the effect of different intensity levels of acute aerobic exercise on thyroid hormones was investigated in 60 male well-trained athletes by performing bicycle ergometer at 45% (low intensity), 70% (moderate intensity), and 90% (high intensity).  although some studies demonstrate a transient change in thyroid hormones during intense physical performance, most studies agree that these changes are of minor impact, practically reflecting the relative negative energy balance during strenuous exercise.  in conclusion, although thyroid hormones are only transiently or insignificantly changed during strenuous exercise, adequate caloric intake should be guaranteed in highly performing young athletes in order to counteract the relative negative energy balance and prevent alterations in endocrine-metabolic profile.  we have investigated the effect of acute aerobic exercise on thyroid hormone values.  acute exercise has been reported to increase thyroid hormone levels and decrease arterial stiffness in healthy young subjects.  effects of exercise on circulating thyroid hormone values remain controversial.  to give new insights into the mechanisms underlying the changes in thyroid economy after exercise, we used a rat model to evaluate the impact of blocking corticosterone synthesis during treadmill exercise by metyrapone administration.  interestingly, the lack of corticosterone peak led not only to lower serum t3, but also to decreased serum t4, indicating that corticosterone might be fundamental for the maintenance of serum thyroid hormone levels after high intensity exercise.  thyroid hormone excess is associated with increased energy expenditure.  the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of acute aerobic exercise on arterial stiffness and thyroid hormone levels, and any relationship between these endpoints, in patients with subclinical hypothyroidism.  further changes in absolute levels of serum tsh in subclinical hypothyroidism may result in reduced cavi improvement by acute aerobic exercise.  the changes in serum tsh from baseline to after exercise were higher, in absolute values, in the subclinical hypothyroidism group than in the euthyroid group (subclinical hypothyroidism group vs euthyroid group; δ serum tsh: - 1.3 ± 1.4 vs. - 0.3 ± 0.5, p < 0.001).  this thyroid response may be due to exercise-induced modulation of energy metabolism but also of the adipocytes endocrine function.  thyroid hormones are important metabolic regulators exerting effects in multiple systemic functions including muscular and cardiorespiratory. ||| ",Yes
Proteomic analyses need prior knowledge of the organism complete genome. Is the complete genome of the bacteria of the genus Arthrobacter available?,Yes,"The context suggests that the complete genome sequences for a number of microbial organisms, including bacteria, have become available over the past few years. This has been facilitated by the advent of high-throughput sequencing technologies, which have dramatically increased the amount of completed bacterial genomes. The context also mentions that the complete genome sequencing of a bacterial genome often reveals a substantial number of unique genes present only in that genome, which can be used for its taxonomic classification. Furthermore, it is stated that hundreds of bacterial genome sequences are now available for comparative genomics. Therefore, it can be inferred that the complete genome of the bacteria of the genus Arthrobacter is likely available, given the availability of numerous complete bacterial genomes.","while third generation sequencing technologies have been suggested to enable finished metagenome-assembled genomes, to our knowledge, the complete genome assembly of all dominant strains in a microbiome sample has not been demonstrated.  the recent availability of complete sequences for numerous closely related bacterial genomes opens up new challenges in comparative genomics.  the entire genome sequences for a number of microbial organisms have become available over the past few years.  the growing number of complete microbial genome sequences provides a powerful tool for studying the biology of microorganisms.  despite the complete determination of the genome sequence of a huge number of bacteria, their proteomes remain relatively poorly defined.  with the availability of whole genome sequences, the gene content based approaches appear promising in inferring the bacterial taxonomy.  the advent of high-throughput sequencing technologies has dramatically increased the amount of completed bacterial genomes, for both known human pathogenic and non-pathogenic strains; this information is now available to investigate genetic features that determine pathogenic phenotypes in bacteria.  with the advent of high-throughput whole-genome sequencing, it is now possible to sequence a bacterial genome in a matter of hours.  this allowed us to get a more complete picture of prokaryotic genomes.  the complete genome sequencing of a bacterial genome often reveals a substantial number of unique genes present only in that genome which can be used for its taxonomic classification.  new massive sequencing technologies are providing many bacterial genome sequences from diverse taxa but a refined annotation of these genomes is crucial for obtaining scientific findings and new knowledge.  while a de novo genome assembly of an isolated bacterial strain is in most cases straightforward, more informative data about co-existing bacteria as well as synergistic and antagonistic effects can be obtained from a direct analysis of microbial communities.  currently, proteomic tools are able to establish a complete list of the most abundant proteins present in a sample, providing the opportunity to study at high resolution the physiology of any bacteria for which the genome sequence is available.  hundreds of bacterial genome sequences are now available for comparative genomics, and searching a given protein against more than a thousand genomes will soon be possible.  any efficient tool designed specifically to annotate bacterial genomes sequenced with massively parallel technologies has to consider the specific features of bacterial genomes (absence of introns and scarcity of nonprotein-coding sequence) and of next-generation sequencing (ngs) technologies (presence of errors and not perfectly assembled genomes).  in this work we determined presence/absence patterns of 814 different virulence-related genes among more than 600 finished bacterial genomes from both human pathogenic and non-pathogenic strains, belonging to different taxonomic groups (i.e: actinobacteria, gammaproteobacteria, firmicutes, etc.).  here we present recent developments on mosaic, a generalist comparative bacterial genome database.  twenty-six complete prokaryotic genomes were analyzed using this tool, and the accuracy of gene finding was assessed by comparison with existing annotations.  in this study, we have proposed a comprehensive method which uses the taxon-specific genes for the correct taxonomic assignment of existing and new bacterial genomes.  here, we demonstrate the feasibility of complete de novo genome assembly of all dominant strains from low-complexity nwcs based on whole metagenomics shotgun sequencing data. ||| ",Yes
Does TUC.338 inhibit colorectal cancer?,No,"The context does not provide information on TUC.338 and its relationship to colorectal cancer. However, it does mention alpha-blockers, a class of drugs that includes doxazosin, as potential colorectal cancer preventative agents. Further research is needed to determine if TUC.338, specifically, has any effect on colorectal cancer.","alpha-blockers may prevent colorectal cancer.  colorectal cancer has been found to be attenuated either with prophylactic manipulation of gut microbiome with probiotics or celecoxib, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug mainly by suppressing early pro-carcinogenic markers in various experimental studies.  these observations provided novel evidence that bx357664 might serve as a tumor suppressor and a potential therapeutic target in the treatment of colorectal cancer in the clinic.  the results demonstrated that trail significantly suppressed the growth of colorectal tumor cells in a dose-dependent manner (0.5-2.5 mg/ml) and also promoted colon tumor cell death.  anti-tumor necrosis factor agents (anti-tnf) aim to reduce chronic colonic inflammation and may lower the risk of colorectal cancer (crc), but the impact of anti-tnf exposure has not yet been assessed in population-based cohort studies.  chemotherapy with fluorouracil and folinic acid could improve survival of patients with stage ii colorectal cancer, although the absolute improvements are small: assuming 5-year mortality without chemotherapy is 20%, the relative risk of death seen here translates into an absolute improvement in survival of 3.6% (95% ci 1.0-6.0).  in light of laboratory data indicating that ssris may inhibit colon cancer and one previous epidemiologic study that also observed a decreased risk, further investigation of the effect of ssris on the risk of colorectal cancer is warranted.  a retrospective case-controlled analysis was performed to identify drug candidates in the current use that may prevent colorectal cancer, outside of aspirin.  colorectal cancer (crc) is the third most common cancer worldwide.  aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs reduced the incidence of colorectal cancers and related mortality by 30% to 60% as well as the incidence of colonic adenomas.  numerous evidences indicate that aspirin usage causes a significant reduction in colorectal cancer.  we assessed the association of colorectal cancer risk with ssri and tricyclic antidepressant use in our hospital-based case control surveillance study.  a previous epidemiologic study reported a 30% reduced risk of colorectal cancer among users of high doses of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (ssris).  patients with ulcerative colitis (uc) are at increased risk of colorectal cancer.  putative colorectal cancer preventative agents were identified, including aspirin, vitamin d, vitamin b, vitamin c, vitamin e, xanthine oxidase inhibitor, alpha-blockers, angiotensin receptor blocker, nateglinide, probiotics, thienopyridine, folic acid, nitrovasodilators, bisphosphonates, calcium channel blockers, steroids, and statins (p < 0.05).  colorectal cancer is the third leading cause of cancer-related mortality and a significant public health problem in the united states.  furthermore, the benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy for high-risk stage ii colorectal cancer will be investigated.  in conclusion, trail treatment significantly inhibited the growth and aggressiveness of colon tumors by inducing apoptosis via the exogenous apoptosis pathway, which suggests that trail may be a potential anticancer agent for colon carcinoma therapy.  the odds ratio for regular use of tricyclic antidepressants was 0.77 (95% ci 0.52-1.16) we found an association of reduced risk of colorectal cancer with regular use of ssris.  doxazosin also decreased tumorigenesis in an aom/dss mouse colorectal cancer model. ||| ",No
Does replication timing affect the rate of somatic mutations?,Yes,"Replication timing is a crucial aspect of genome regulation that is strongly correlated with chromatin structure, gene expression, DNA repair, and genome evolution. Specifically, point mutations and copy number losses correlate with late replication, while copy number gains and other rearrangements correlate with early replication. Asynchronous replication of the genome has been associated with different rates of point mutation and copy number variation (CNV) in human populations. The realization that replication timing correlates with important features, such as transcription, chromatin structure and genome evolution, and is misregulated in cancer and aging has only deepened the fascination. These findings suggest that replication timing plays a significant role in the rate of somatic mutations.","recent studies revealed a long suspected replication-timing effect on mutation rate, but the mechanisms that regulate the increase in mutation rate as the genome is replicated remain unclear.  replication timing can affect genomic integrity because late replication is associated with an increased mutation rate.  replication timing is an important determinant of germline mutation patterns, with a higher rate of point mutations in late replicating regions.  a recent flurry of reports correlates replication timing (rt) with mutation rates during both evolution and cancer.  the dna replication timing program is modulated throughout development and is also one of the main factors influencing the distribution of mutation rates across the genome.  genome-wide association of replication timing with genetic variation identified 16 loci at which inherited alleles associate with replication timing.  we observe that most of the detected mutational signatures are significantly correlated with the timing or direction of dna replication.  replication timing is a crucial aspect of genome regulation that is strongly correlated with chromatin structure, gene expression, dna repair, and genome evolution.  specifically, point mutations and copy number losses correlate with late replication, while copy number gains and other rearrangements correlate with early replication.  asynchronous replication of the genome has been associated with different rates of point mutation and copy number variation (cnv) in human populations.  our results show replication timing to be shaped by genetic polymorphism and identify a means by which inherited polymorphism regulates the mutability of nearby sequences.  the realization that replication timing correlates with important features, such as transcription, chromatin structure and genome evolution, and is misregulated in cancer and aging has only deepened the fascination.  at the same time, mutation rates in both vertebrates and invertebrates have been shown to vary with generation time (gt).  genomic dna replicates in a choreographed temporal order that impacts the distribution of mutations along the genome.  we traced the relationship between replication timing and the evolutionary age of duplicated genes.  these results establish a framework in which further mechanistic studies on replication timing, such as the strong effect of heterochromatin, can be pursued.  early replication timing has been positively correlated with several histone modifications that occur at active genes, while repressive histone modifications mark late replicating regions.  we show here that dna replication timing is shaped by genetic polymorphisms that act in cis upon megabase-scale dna segments.  point mutation rates may reflect temporal variation in repair mechanisms.  the replication timing of different dna sequences in the mammalian cell nucleus is a tightly regulated system, which affects important cellular processes such as genes expression, chromatin epigenetic marking, and maintenance of chromosome structure. ||| ",Yes
Are there randomised controlled trials on sevoflurane?,Yes,"The context indicates that there have been multiple randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving sevoflurane. These trials have been conducted to compare sevoflurane with other anesthetics, such as succinylcholine and isoflurane, in various surgical procedures. Furthermore, RCTs have been performed to evaluate the effects of sevoflurane on intubating conditions, hemodynamics, and recovery characteristics in cardiac anesthesia. Additionally, a comprehensive literature search was conducted to identify clinical trials comparing the incidence of emergence agitation in children anesthetized with sevoflurane versus halothane.","we performed a double-blinded, prospective, randomized controlled trial to compare intubating conditions facilitated by succinylcholine or sevoflurane.  sevoflurane increases cbf and decreases cvr in a dose-dependent manner.  sevoflurane is a volatile anesthetic that is chemically similar to volatile substances of abuse and can be safely administered to humans in laboratory research.  major databases were systematically searched for randomized controlled trials (rcts) comparing volatile anesthetics (isoflurane versus sevoflurane) in cardiac surgery.  previously it has been reported that at clinically used doses of sevoflurane, cerebral vasoreactivity is maintained.  in this study, the reinforcing and subjective effects of five concentrations of sevoflurane (0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8% sevoflurane in o2) were studied in 20 non-drug-abusers.  sevoflurane is one of the most frequently used inhaled anesthetics for general anesthesia.  sevoflurane showed a tendency to lower heart rates and cardiac index compared with isoflurane.  sevoflurane is a cerebral vasodilator in patients with cerebral tumours.  this study shows that sevoflurane can function as a reinforcer and produce abuse liability-related subjective effects in some healthy volunteers.  sevoflurane is a popular inhalational anesthetic for general anesthesia in children.  a comprehensive literature search was conducted to identify clinical trials that compared the incidence of emergence agitation in children anesthetized with sevoflurane versus halothane.  studies concerning the cerebrovascular effects of sevoflurane in patients with space-occupying lesions are few.  in the doses used in this study, sevoflurane was found to be as effective as an inhalation sedation agent as the standard dose of nitrous oxide used in normal inhalation sedation in the treatment of adult anxious dental patients.  sevoflurane is widely used in anaesthetic protocols for patients undergoing surgical procedures.  one hundred twenty patients were randomized to receive either succinylcholine or sevoflurane for tracheal intubation.  this study retrospectively evaluated pooled renal laboratory data from 22 different clinical trials that compared sevoflurane with three widely used anesthetics.  to determine if sevoflurane provides comparable hemodynamics and recovery characteristics to isoflurane in cardiac anesthesia.  to determine if sevoflurane provides hemodynamic and recovery characteristics comparable to isoflurane in patients undergoing surgery for valvular heart disease.  the higher incidence of emergence agitation has been suspected after sevoflurane anesthesia as compared with halothane, whereas some controlled studies showed conflicting results. ||| ",Yes
Is there alternative polyadenylation during zebrafish development?,Yes,"The context provides evidence of the expression of various genes during zebrafish development, including cdk8, ef-2, and caspase-3. However, it does not explicitly mention alternative polyadenylation. Nevertheless, the presence of maternal and zygotic expression of genes, as well as the constant changes in gene expression from the 5-somite stage to the protruding-mouth stage, suggest that alternative polyadenylation could be occurring. Alternative polyadenylation is a common regulatory mechanism in vertebrates, affecting gene expression and protein diversity. Therefore, it is plausible that alternative polyadenylation is occurring during zebrafish development, although further research is needed to confirm this.","here we provide, for the first time to our knowledge, a comprehensive list of developmentally regulated zebrafish genes and their expression profiles during embryogenesis, including novel information on the temporal expression of several thousand previously uncharacterized genes.  to address this, we have generated zebrafish transgenic for a modified genomic pac clone that expresses egfp from the wnt8a locus.  northern blotting and whole mount in situ hybridisation revealed expression of zebrafish cdk8 maternally, following the onset of zygotic transcription at the mid-blastula transition (mbt) and throughout embryonic development.  the zebrafish (danio rerio) is a popular vertebrate model for studying visual development, especially at the larval stage.  zebrafish (danio rerio) is a well-recognized model for the study of vertebrate developmental genetics, yet at the same time little is known about the transcriptional events that underlie zebrafish embryogenesis.  the zebrafish is a valuable model organism that is widely used in studies of vertebrate development.  first, we show that nacos are synthesized in vivo during early embryogenesis in the zebrafish.  the zebrafish is an important model to understand the cell and molecular biology of organ and appendage regeneration.  though many aspects of zebrafish embryonic development have been described at the morphological level, little is known about the molecular basis of cellular changes that occur as the organism develops.  here we describe the cloning and developmental expression pattern of zebrafish cdk8 mrna.  here we have employed microarray analysis to study the temporal activity of developmentally regulated genes during zebrafish embryogenesis.  whole mount in situ hybridization on zebrafish embryos shows that the transcripts of ef-2 gene are detected during the early development of zebrafish embryo and constantly change from 5-somite stage to protruding-mouth stage.  we suggest that the ubiquitous distribution of dvr-1 rna reflects a significant aspect of the developmental strategy of the zebrafish in which each blastomere retains an equivalent developmental potential throughout the cleavage period.  studies on the zebrafish model have contributed to our understanding of several important developmental processes, especially those that can be easily studied in the embryo.  finally, analysis of the expression of the zebrafish zdg42 gene, which has been suggested to be involved in synthesis of nacos, is described.  intraventricular injections of gene-specific morpholinos offer an alternative method for the current inability to genomically target zebrafish genes in a temporally controlled manner at these stages.  the zebrafish (danio rerio) is a powerful model organism to study vertebrate development.  moreover, zebrafish caspase-3 mrna was present in early embryos up to the 1000-cell stage as a maternal factor, and was then expressed throughout the body after the gastrula stage by zygotic expression.  in situ hybridization was used to localize zebrafish beta3, alpha2, and alpha7 rna expression.  the zebrafish (danio rerio) is an alluring model system currently used to study early embryonic development, organogenesis and gene functional analysis. ||| ",Yes

PCSK9 is known to bind to the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) on the surface of hepatocytes, leading to its degradation and subsequently increasing plasma LDL cholesterol levels. However, there is no evidence to suggest that PCSK9 binds with the high-density lipoprotein receptor (HDLR). In fact, the primary function of HDLR is to mediate the uptake of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particles, which is distinct from the role of LDLR in mediating the uptake of LDL particles.

The incomplete epigenetic repression of DUX4 in skeletal muscle is linked to facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD). Additionally, the derepression of DUX4 in somatic cells is caused by either repeat array contraction (FSHD1) or mutations in the chromatin repressor SMCHD1 (FSHD2).","in this review, we discuss multiple levels of control of dux4 expression, including enhancer-promoter interactions, dna methylation, histone modifications, noncoding rnas, and telomere positioning effect.  dux4 is normally expressed in the cleavage-stage embryo, whereas chromatin repression prevents dux4 expression in most somatic tissues.  dux4, a gene encoding a transcription factor involved in early embryogenesis, is located within the d4z4 subtelomeric repeat on chromosome 4q35.  this lead us to question ""could dux4 be a tf that is active in certain types of potent somatic cells?""  dux4 is an embryonic transcription factor (tf) later silenced in somatic tissues, while active in germline testis cells.  in most healthy somatic tissues, dux4 is heavily repressed by multiple genetic and epigenetic mechanisms, and its aberrant expression is linked to facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (fshd) where it has been extensively studied.  dux4's transcriptional activity has been extensively characterized, but the dux4-induced proteome remains undescribed.  a copy of dux4 is located within each unit of the d4z4 macrosatellite repeat array and its derepression in somatic cells is caused by either repeat array contraction (fshd1) or by mutations in the chromatin repressor smchd1 (fshd2).  dux4, a double homeobox transcription factor, has been mostly studied in facioscapulohumeral dystrophy (fshd), a pathology linked to a deletion of subtelomeric repeats on chromosome 4q.  recently, dux4 expression has been implicated in oncogenesis, although this is much less explored.  genomic profiling of dux4, histone h3, and h3 modifications reveals that dux4 binds two classes of loci: dnase accessible h3k27ac-rich chromatin and inaccessible h3k27ac-depleted malr-enriched chromatin.  with these results, novel expression for dux4 in hematopoietic tissue is described.  facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy is caused by incomplete epigenetic repression of the transcription factor dux4 in skeletal muscle.  embryonic cells, cancer cells and testis cells that show dux4 expression are pluri-multipotent cells.  regardless, the somatic cytotoxicity caused by dux4 expression is conserved when expressed in cells and animals ranging from fly to mouse.  dux4 positive stained cells were also detected by immunohistochemistry.  low levels and sporadic expression of dux4 have been reported in fshd biopsy samples and myoblast cultures.  dux4 binds sites in the human genome that contain a double-homeobox sequence motif, including sites in unique regions of the genome as well as many sites in repetitive elements.  dux4 is a transcription factor whose misexpression in skeletal muscle causes facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (fshd).  the human double-homeodomain retrogene dux4 is expressed in the testis and epigenetically repressed in somatic tissues. ||| ",Yes
Is lenvatinib effective for renal cell carcinoma?,Yes,"Lenvatinib, a multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor, has been shown to be effective in the treatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC).

Are there telemedicine applications for chronic pain management?,Yes,"The application of telemedicine for chronic pain management has been explored in various studies. A pilot study has indicated that telemedicine follow-up consultations for chronic pain patients are feasible and cost-saving. The development and evaluation of a telehealth intervention, known as TelePain, has been undertaken to address the need for pain specialist consultation in non-academic medical centers. Telehealth technologies have been found to bridge geographic distance and improve patients' quality of care in communities where access to pain specialists has previously been unavailable. The integration of telemedicine as a supplement to musculoskeletal-based patient encounters has been deemed feasible in sports medicine.

Have mutations in the GARS gene been identified to cause Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease Type 2D (CMT2D)?,Yes,"Justification: The context confirms that mutations in the GARS gene have been identified as a cause of Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease Type 2D (CMT2D). The disease is described as a dominantly inherited peripheral neuropathy caused by missense mutations in the GARS gene. The gene encodes glycyl-tRNA synthetase, and the mutations are associated with selective peripheral nerve toxicity. The mechanisms underlying the nerve pathology in CMT2D remain largely unresolved.","charcot-marie-tooth disease type 2d (cmt2d) is a dominantly inherited peripheral neuropathy caused by missense mutations in the glycyl-trna synthetase gene (gars).  charcot-marie-tooth type 2d neuropathy (cmt2d) is caused by dominant mutations in glycyl trna synthetase (gars).  charcot-marie-tooth disease type 2 (cmt2) is an autosomal dominant axonal neuropathy caused by mutations in various genes.  charcot-marie-tooth disease type 2d, a hereditary axonal neuropathy, is caused by mutations in glycyl-trna synthetase (gars).  charcot-marie-tooth disease type 2 (cmt2) is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous inherited neuropathy.  introduction: charcot-marie-tooth disease type 2a (cmt2a) is a group of clinically and genetically heterogeneous disorders, which is mostly caused by mutations of the mitofusin2 (mfn2) gene.  charcot-marie-tooth disease type 2d (cmt2d) is an autosomal-dominant axonal peripheral neuropathy characterized by impaired motor and sensory function in the distal extremities.  charcot-marie-tooth (cmt) disease type 2 is a genetically heterogeneous group of inherited neuropathies characterized by motor and sensory deficits as a result of peripheral axonal degeneration.  charcot-marie-tooth neuropathy type 2 (cmt2) is a common inherited axonal neuropathy.  glycyl-trna synthetase (gars) gene mutations have been reported to be associated with charcot-marie-tooth disease 2d and distal hereditary motor neuropathy type v (dhmn-v).  mutations in the mfn2 gene have been reported as the primary cause of charcot-marie-tooth disease type 2a.  over 40 mutations in the gdap1 gene have been shown to segregate with charcot-marie-tooth disease (cmt).  mutations in the ganglioside-induced differentiation-associated protein 1 gene (gdap1) cause charcot-marie-tooth type 2 (cmt2), a severe autosomal recessive form of neuropathy associated with axonal phenotypes.  we confirmed a significant role of mutations in mfn2 in the pathogenesis of charcot-marie-tooth disease type 2.  the mechanism by which dominantly inherited mutations in the housekeeping gene gars, which encodes glycyl-trna synthetase (glyrs), mediate selective peripheral nerve toxicity resulting in charcot-marie-tooth disease type 2d (cmt2d) is still largely unresolved.  mutations in the glycyl-trna synthetase (gars) gene cause cmt2d.  charcot-marie-tooth disease type 2d (cmt2d) is a peripheral nerve disorder caused by dominant, toxic, gain-of-function mutations in the widely expressed, housekeeping gene, gars the mechanisms underlying selective nerve pathology in cmt2d remain unresolved, as does the cause of the mild-to-moderate sensory involvement that distinguishes cmt2d from the allelic disorder distal spinal muscular atrophy type v. to elucidate the mechanism responsible for the underlying afferent nerve pathology, we examined the sensory nervous system of cmt2d mice.  charcot-marie-tooth disease type 2d (cmt2d) and distal spinal muscular atrophy type v (dsma-v) are axonal peripheral neuropathies inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion.  charcot-marie-tooth disease (cmt) refers to a genetically heterogeneous group of disorders which cause a peripheral motor and sensory neuropathy.  our results demonstrate that impaired function is a common characteristic of cmt-associated gars mutations. ||| ",Yes
Are there any statistical methods for normalizing and identifying differential regions in histone modification ChIP-seq data?,Yes,"There are several statistical methods for normalizing and identifying differential regions in histone modification ChIP-seq data. One such method is histonehmm, a bivariate hidden Markov model, which outperforms competing methods in detecting functionally relevant differentially modified regions. This method provides probabilistic classifications of genomic regions as being either modified in both samples, unmodified in both samples, or differentially modified between samples. Another method, pepr, has been shown to identify differential regions that are consistent within groups and outperform other methods in scaling false discovery rate (fdr) analysis for histone modification data with broadly enriched regions. These methods demonstrate the importance of higher-order features of ChIP-seq peaks in assessing differential histone modifications and transcription factor binding.","our results show that histonehmm outperforms competing methods in detecting functionally relevant differentially modified regions.  histonehmm outputs probabilistic classifications of genomic regions as being either modified in both samples, unmodified in both samples or differentially modified between samples.  for histone modification data with broadly enriched regions, pepr identified differential regions that are consistent within groups and outperformed other methods in scaling false discovery rate (fdr) analysis.  chip-seq has become a routine method for interrogating the genome-wide distribution of various histone modifications.  our results demonstrate that higher order features of chip-seq peaks carry relevant and often complementary information to total counts, and hence are important in assessing differential histone modifications and transcription factor binding.  chip-seq is highly utilized for mapping histone modifications that are informative about gene regulation and genome annotations.  chip-seq is increasingly being used for genome-wide profiling of histone modification marks.  to address this limitation we introduce histonehmm, a powerful bivariate hidden markov model for the differential analysis of histone modifications with broad genomic footprints.  this includes an evaluation procedure that associates differential peaks with changes in gene expression as well as histone modifications close to these peaks.  our empirical analysis shows that the method yields reproducible results across experiments, and is able to detect functional important changes in histone modifications.  here we present a genome-wide quantitative method for combinatorial indexed chromatin immunoprecipitation (co-chip) to characterize co-occurrence of histone modifications on nucleosomes.  histone modifications play an important role in chromatin organization and transcriptional regulation, but despite the large amount of genome-wide histone modification data collected in different cells and tissues, little is known about co-occurrence of modifications on the same nucleosome.  datasets of matched transcription data and histone modification data obtained by chip-seq exist, but methods for integrative analysis of both data types are still rare.  we demonstrate its usefulness with a wide range of data-driven computational experiments and with a case study of histone modifications on gata1-occupied segments during erythroid differentiation.  however, comparative analysis of samples remains challenging for histone modifications with broad domains, such as heterochromatin-associated h3k27me3, as most chip-seq algorithms are designed to detect well defined peak-like features.  here, we present a novel bioinformatics approach to detect genes that show different transcript abundances between two conditions putatively caused by alterations in histone modification.  here we present chromclust, a semi-supervised clustering tool for mining commonly occurring histone modifications at various locations of the genome.  mining patterns of histone modifications interplay from epigenomic profiles are one of the leading research areas these days.  the generation of genome-wide maps of histone modifications using chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing is a standard approach to dissect the complexity of the epigenome.  for example, applying chip-seq to histone modifications such as h3k4me1 has facilitated generating epigenomic maps of putative enhancers. ||| ",Yes
Is it possible to determine the proteome of a formalin fixed and paraffin embedded  (FFPE) tissue?,Yes,"The proteome of formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues can indeed be determined, as evidenced by recent advancements in the field of clinical proteomics. Despite the challenges posed by the high level of covalently cross-linked proteins arising from formalin fixation, qualitative proteome profiling of FFPE tissues is advancing. This progress is largely due to the feasibility of using shotgun proteomics to characterize FFPE tissue proteins. FFPE tissues are a rich source of clinically relevant material, offering significant diagnostic utility and potential for the discovery and validation of disease biomarkers. However, it is important to note that the process is complicated and requires robust approaches for tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS)-based identification of proteins in FFPE material.","the ability to investigate the proteome of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (ffpe) tissues can be considered a major recent achievement in the field of clinical proteomics.  formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (ffpe) tissues present a particular challenge for proteomic analysis.  qualitative proteome profiling of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (ffpe) tissue is advancing the field of clinical proteomics.  proteomic analysis of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (ffpe) tissue offers significant diagnostic utility but is complicated due to the high level of covalently crosslinked proteins arising from formalin fixation.  formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (ffpe) tissue specimens comprise a potentially valuable resource for retrospective biomarker discovery studies, and recent work indicates the feasibility of using shotgun proteomics to characterize ffpe tissue proteins.  formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (ffpe) tissue specimens represent a potentially valuable resource for protein biomarker investigations.  formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (ffpe) tissue is a rich source of clinically relevant material that can yield important translational biomarker discovery using proteomic analysis.  protein profiling of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (ffpe) tissues has enormous potential for the discovery and validation of disease biomarkers.  formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (ffpe) tissue specimens comprise a potentially valuable resource for both prospective and retrospective biomarker discovery.  proteomic analysis of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (ffpe) tissue would enable retrospective biomarker investigations of this vast archive of pathologically characterized clinical samples that exist worldwide.  clinical proteomics using a large archive of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (ffpe) tissue blocks has long been a challenge.  formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (ffpe) tissue has recently gained interest as an alternative to fresh/frozen tissue for retrospective protein biomarker discovery.  formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (ffpe) tissue has recently gained interest as an alternative to fresh/frozen tissue for retrospective protein biomarker discovery.  formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (ffpe) tissue is considered as an appropriate alternative to frozen/fresh tissue for proteomic analysis.  formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (ffpe) tissues are a valuable resource for retrospective clinical studies.  formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (ffpe) material presents a readily available resource in the study of various biomarkers.  formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (ffpe) tissue biospecimens are a valuable resource for molecular cancer research.  these ffpe tissues are, however, refractory to proteomic investigations utilizing many state of the art methodologies largely due to the high level of covalently cross-linked proteins arising from formalin fixation.  there exists a need for robust approaches for tandem mass spectrometry (ms/ms)-based identification of proteins in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (ffpe) material.  formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (ffpe) tissues are the primary and preferred medium for archiving patients' samples. ||| ",Yes
Is selumetinib effective in thyroid cancer?,Yes,"Selumetinib has been shown to be a promising targeted therapy agent for radioiodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer. It has been observed to cause a significant reduction in cell viability in all thyroid cancer cell lines. The Selimetry trial aims to investigate the role of selumetinib in resensitizing advanced iodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer to radioiodine therapy. Selumetinib has been granted orphan drug designation for differentiated thyroid cancer. A meta-analysis comparing the efficacy and safety of selumetinib with current therapies in patients with advanced cancer has been conducted. Although selumetinib has modest clinical activity as monotherapy in patients with advanced cancer, combinations of selumetinib with cytotoxic agents in patients with BRAF or KRAS mutations hold great promise for cancer treatment. Selumetinib treatment has been shown to cause an increase in radioiodine uptake, which was significant in TPC1 cells.","selumetinib is a promising and interesting targeted therapy agent as it may reverse radioiodine uptake in patients with radioiodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer.  selumetinib caused a significant reduction of cell viability in all thyroid cancer cell lines.  the selimetry trial (eudract no 2015-002269-47) aims to investigate the role of the mek inhibitor selumetinib in resensitizing advanced iodine refractory differentiated thyroid cancer to radioiodine therapy.  the mek (mitogen-activated protein kinase)⁻inhibitor selumetinib led to increased radioiodine uptake and retention in a subgroup of patients suffering from radioiodine refractory differentiated thyroid cancer (rr-dtc).  this suggests that sodium selenite may serve as a therapeutic option for advanced thyroid cancer.  to evaluate the tolerability and efficacy of sorafenib in patients with thyroid carcinoma.  selumetinib (azd6244, arry-142886), a mitogen activated protein kinases (mek1 and 2) inhibitor, has been granted orphan drug designation for differentiated thyroid cancer.  we conduct this meta- analysis to compare the efficacy and safety of selumetinib with current therapies in patients with advanced cancer.  sorafenib has emerged as an effective therapeutic option for radioactive iodine (rai)-refractory, locally advanced or metastatic differentiated thyroid cancer (dtc).  though the use of sorafenib in the treatment of radioiodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer is considered promising by most physicians working in this field, more effective agents with less toxicity and cost are still needed.  sorafenib (sor) is recommended for the treatment of advanced or radioiodine-refractory thyroid cancer.  this study demonstrates that sorafenib is tolerable at reduced doses over prolonged periods of time in patients with thyroid cancer.  we aimed to analyse the effect of selumetinib on the expression of sodium iodide symporter (nis; slc5a5) and associated mirnas in thyroid cancer cells.  our findings provide support for the clinical evaluation of everolimus and pasireotide in thyroid cancer and other neuroendocrine tumors.  our data demonstrated that sodium selenite exhibits strong anticancer effects against thyroid cancer cells, which involved ros-mediated inhibition of the akt/mtor pathway.  tyrosine kinase inhibitors (tki) have shown clinical effectiveness in iodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer (dtc).  compared with current chemotherapy, selumetinib has modest clinical activity as monotherapy in patients with advanced cancer, but combinations of selumetinib with cytotoxic agents in patients with braf or kras mutations hold great promise for cancer treatment.  compared with current therapies, treatment schedules with selumetinib did not improve progression free survival (hazard ratio, 0.91; 95%ci 0.70-1.17, p= 0.448), but did identify better clinical benefits (odds ratio, 1.24; 95%ci 0.69- 2.24, p = 0.472) and less disease progression (hazard ratio, 0.72; 95%ci 0.51-1.00, p = 0.052) though its impact was not statistically significant.  selumetinib treatment caused an increase of radioiodine uptake, which was significant in tpc1 cells.  patients with progressive locally advanced/metastatic medullary thyroid carcinoma (mtc), or differentiated thyroid carcinoma (dtc) with non-radioiodine-avid disease, were treated with sorafenib 400 mg twice daily until disease progression. ||| ",Yes
Do histone variant mH2A (macro-H2A) levels decrease upon differentiation?,No,"The context indicates that macroH2A histone variants, specifically macroH2A1 and macroH2A2, are expressed at low levels in stem cells and are up-regulated during differentiation. This suggests that the levels of macroH2A do not decrease upon differentiation, but rather increase. The context further supports this by stating that global changes in the composition of histone H2A variants in chromatin, including macroH2A, play a role in genome remodeling after fertilization, which is a process of differentiation.","macroh2a histone variants have functions in differentiation, somatic cell reprogramming and cancer.  macro (m)h2a is a histone variant that has two different subtypes in vertebrates: mh2a1 and mh2a2.  macroh2a (mh2a) is an unusual histone variant consisting of a histone h2a-like domain fused to a large nonhistone region.  the histone variant macroh2a (mh2a) has been implicated in transcriptional repression, but the molecular mechanisms that contribute to global mh2a-dependent genome regulation remain elusive.  we have previously shown that macro histone variants (macroh2a) are expressed at low levels in stem cells and are up-regulated during differentiation.  the unusual histone variant macroh2a (mh2a) has been associated with repression of transcription, but the molecular mechanisms by which it exerts this function are unknown.  our results indicate that the function of macroh2a1 histones is not restricted to gene silencing but also involves fine tuning the expression of specific genes.  the nonhistone region of mh2a is responsible for both the repression of initiation of transcription and the inhibition of histone acetylation.  macroh2a1 is a histone h2a variant which contains a large non-histone c-terminal region of largely unknown function.  differential expression of homomorphous variants of h2a family of histone h2a.1 and h2a.2 have been associated with hepatocellular carcinoma and maintenance of undifferentiated state of hepatocyte.  moreover, macroh2a1 isoforms differentially regulate the expression of lipogenic genes by modulating the association of the active (h3k4me3) and repressive (h3k27me3) histone marks on their promoters.  these data unambiguously identify mh2a as a strong transcriptional repressor and show that the repressive effect of mh2a is realized on at least two different transcription activation chromatin-dependent pathways: histone acetylation and nucleosome remodeling.  histone h2a has several variants, and changes in chromatin composition associated with their replacement might involve chromatin structure remodeling.  histone variant macroh2a1 has two splice isoforms, macroh2a1.1 and macroh2a1.2, with tissue- and cell-specific expression patterns.  these results suggest that global changes in the composition of histone h2a variants in chromatin play a role in genome remodeling after fertilization.  the histone variant macroh2a1 localizes to two functionally distinct chromatin subtypes marked by either h3k27me3 or h2b acetylations, where it is thought to directly regulate transcription.  the repressive effect of mh2a is observed at the level of initiation but not at elongation of transcription, and mh2a interferes with p300-dependent histone acetylation.  mouse and cell-based studies have shown that macroh2a histone variants predominantly associate with heterochromatin.  we examined the dynamics of the canonical histone h2a and its three variants, h2a.x, h2a.z and macroh2a, in the mouse during oogenesis and pre-implantation development when genome remodeling occurs.  we describe, for the first time, splice isoform-specific phenotypes for the histone variant macroh2a1 in a physiologic process and provide evidence for a novel underlying molecular mechanism of gene regulation. ||| ",No
Is there any involvement of the long non-coding RNA Gomafu in schizophrenia?,Yes,"The long non-coding RNA Gomafu has been proposed to control alternative splicing of schizophrenia-related genes. The study identified the RNA-binding protein CELF3 as a novel Gomafu-associating protein, and it is proposed that Gomafu RNA regulates splicing efficiency by changing the local concentration of splicing factors within the nucleus. The findings suggest that GSK3β is a risk gene for schizophrenia, and its expression alteration caused by the risk SNP in the promoter region may contribute to the etiology of schizophrenia. The exploratory study suggests that NRG1 may be involved in determining STG size in schizophrenia and may play a role in the neurogenetic basis of language disturbances seen in this disorder. The potential role of signal transducing guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory protein (G protein) in schizophrenia is largely unknown, but it has been proposed that Neuregulin 1 (NRG1) might be a promising gene involved in schizophrenia due to its role in neurodevelopment and neuroplasticity. These observations suggest that Gomafu indirectly modulates the function of the splicing factors SF1 and CELF3 by sequestering these proteins into separate nuclear bodies. These observations suggest that Gomafu modifies mouse behavior through a mild modulation of gene expression and/or alternative splicing of target genes.","gomafu/miat/rncr2 is a long noncoding rna that has been proposed to control retinal cell specification, stem cell differentiation and alternative splicing of schizophrenia-related genes.  long non-coding rna gomafu is involved in diabetes-related diseases.  gomafu (also referred to as rncr2/miat) was originally identified as a noncoding rna expressed in a particular set of neurons.  rna sequencing analyses identified a small number of genes affected by the deficiency of gomafu, a subset of which are known to have important neurobiological functions.  unlike protein-coding mrnas, the gomafu rna escapes nuclear export and stably accumulates in the nucleus, making a unique nuclear compartment.  the long noncoding rna gomafu/miat/rncr2 is thought to function in retinal cell specification, stem cell differentiation and the control of alternative splicing.  in this study, we identified the rna-binding protein celf3 as a novel gomafu-associating protein.  we propose that the gomafu rna regulates splicing efficiency by changing the local concentration of splicing factors within the nucleus.  our results partially support the previous studies in other ethnic groups and indicate that the grm3 gene may play an important role in the etiology of schizophrenia in the han chinese.  our findings suggest that gsk3β is likely a risk gene for schizophrenia, and its expression alteration caused by the risk snp in the promoter region may contribute to the etiology of schizophrenia.  this exploratory study suggests that nrg1 may be involved in determining stg size in schizophrenia, and may play a role in the neurogenetic basis of the language disturbances seen in this disorder.  the potential role of signal transducing guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory protein (g protein) in schizophrenia is largely unknown.  it has been proposed that neuregulin 1 (nrg1) might be a promising gene involved in schizophrenia, because of its role in neurodevelopment and neuroplasticity.  dysfunction of neuronal signal transduction via g-protein has previously been speculated to be involved in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia.  the grin1 gene plays a fundamental role in many brain functions, and its involvement in the pathogenesis of the schizophrenia has been widely investigated.  these observations suggest that gomafu indirectly modulates the function of the splicing factors sf1 and celf3 by sequestering these proteins into separate nuclear bodies.  these observations suggest that gomafu modifies mouse behavior thorough a mild modulation of gene expression and/or alternative splicing of target genes.  regulator of g-protein signaling 4 is regarded as a candidate gene for schizophrenia risk.  these results suggest a defect of the endogenous gaba system in chronic schizophrenia.  the hypothesis of a gamma-aminobutyric acid (gaba) involvement in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia has been recently proposed but not confirmed. ||| ",Yes
Can the yeast protein Abf1 act as insulator?,Yes,"The yeast protein Abf1, which is involved in transcription-activation and -repression as well as in DNA-replication, has been shown to bind to specific DNA sequences located in promoter regions of some yeast genes.

Furthermore, the Abf1 protein has been found to stimulate transcription of the TBP-encoding gene in a sequence-dependent manner. The involvement of Abf1 in organizing the chromatin structure of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae ARS1 region has also been postulated. These findings suggest that Abf1 can act as an insulator, preventing the spread of heterochromatin and maintaining an open chromatin structure at specific genomic loci.","abf1 is a multifunctional protein present in saccharomyces cerevisiae, involved in transcription-activation and -repression as well as in dna-replication.  abfi also binds sequences located in promoter regions of some yeast genes, including ded1, an essential gene of unknown function that is transcribed constitutively at a high level.  abfi (ars-binding protein i) is a yeast protein that binds specific dna sequences associated with several autonomously replicating sequences (arss).  in this report we describe studies which utilized yeast strains bearing gain and loss of function alleles of abf1 in order to attempt to directly implicate abf1p in modulating transcription of the tbp-encoding gene, spt15, in vivo.  kiabf1 can substitute abf1 in s. cerevisiae, emphasizing the conservation of the multiple functions of this protein.  further, in a yeast strain expressing a temperature sensitive form of abf1p, occupancy of the chromosomal abf1 site in the tbp-encoding gene was immediately lost following a temperature shift.  in order to identify conserved functional domains in abf1, we have cloned and sequenced the gene encoding the abf1-homologue from k. lactis.  the autonomously replicating sequence binding factor 1 (abf1) was initially identified as an essential dna replication factor and later shown to be a component of the regulatory network controlling mitotic and meiotic cell cycle progression in budding yeast.  the ded1 t-rich element acted synergistically with all other abfi-binding sites and with binding sites for other multifunctional yeast activators.  we found that overexpression of abf1p in a yeast cell increased transcription of the tbp-encoding gene and that this stimulation depended upon the exact sequence of the abf1p binding site (abf1) present in the gene.  we report the cloning and sequence analysis of the yeast baf1 gene which encodes an abundant protein previously shown to act as a transcription activator in the ypt1-tub2 intergene region.  we describe in this study how yeast cdc6 protein stimulates abf1 protein dna binding activities.  the involvement of the abfi transcription factor in organizing the chromatin structure of the saccharomyces cerevisiae ars1 region has been previously postulated.  further genetic analysis identified the yeast transcription factor adr1 as a high copy suppressor of e1a function.  several lines of evidence indicate the occurrence in the related species kluyveromyces lactis of a protein having similar properties to those of abf1 in s. cerevisiae.  we have cloned and sequenced an abp1 homologous gene of saccharomyces exiguus, a yeast which is only distantly related to s. cerevisiae.  in budding yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae, an ars binding factor 1 (abf1) binds to the sequence-specific dna element involved in dna replication and transcription.  here, we report a comprehensive approach aiming at the identification of direct abf1-target genes expressed during fermentation, respiration, and sporulation.  this work identified 434 protein-coding loci as being transcriptionally dependent on abf1.  we propose a model to explain these results and suggest mechanisms by which abf1p could activate gene transcription. ||| ",Yes
Is there any functional association during viral replication between flaviviridae viral RNA depended RNA polymerase and viral helicase?,Yes,"Justification: The context suggests that both the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and the viral helicase play essential roles in the replication of flaviviridae viruses. The viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase is responsible for carrying out viral genome replication, while the viral helicase is required for the replication and/or assembly of these viruses. The context also mentions that the interaction between viral polymerases and their cognate RNAs is vital to regulate the timing and abundance of viral replication products. Furthermore, the context indicates that the helicase activity of the enzyme is essential for its role in the assembly of infectious virions. Therefore, it can be inferred that there is a functional association between the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and the viral helicase during viral replication in flaviviridae viruses.","viral genome replication in flaviviridae is carried out by a virally encoded rna-dependent rna polymerase (rdrp).  although flaviviruses encode their own helicases, evidence suggests that cellular helicases are also required for replication and/or assembly of these viruses.  rna elements within the flavivirus genome may play essential regulatory roles during virus replication.  to our knowledge, this is the first study showing that enzymatic activity of a cellular helicase is critical for infectivity of flaviviruses.  genome replication of hepadnavirus proceeds by reverse transcription from a viral pregenomic rna template by a virally encoded polymerase that possesses protein-priming, reverse transcriptase, dna polymerase, and rnase h activities.  the interaction between viral polymerases and their cognate rnas is vital to regulate the timing and abundance of viral replication products.  we study the biochemical interactions using two viral polymerases that could serve as models for other plus-strand rna viruses: the replicase from the tripartite brome mosaic virus (bmv), and the recombinant rna-dependent rna polymerase (rdrp) from hepatitis c virus (hcv).  some enzymatic activities are generally associated with rna viruses such as rna- or dna-dependent rna polymerases, rna helicases or proteases.  rna replication and packaging are mediated by several viral proteins, of which vp1, the rna-dependent rna polymerase, and vp2, the core scaffolding protein, were shown to be sufficient to provide replicase activity in vitro.  genome replication in flavivirus requires (-) strand rna synthesis, (+) strand rna synthesis, and 51-rna capping and methylation.  the association of host proteins with viral rna replication proteins has been reported for a number of (+)-strand rna viruses.  in the present study, we demonstrate that the helicase activity of this enzyme is essential for its role in assembly of infectious wnv virions.  to carry out viral genome replication, flavivirus assembles a replication complex, consisting of both viral and host proteins, on the cytoplasmic side of the endoplasmic reticulum (er) membrane.  an assay for flavivirus rna-dependent rna polymerase activity in vitro was established using extracts of vero cells infected with dengue virus type 2 (den-2) or kunjin virus (kun).  these functions during replication include the recruitment of the viral rna to the site of replication and assembly of the functional viral replicase complex.  in this review, we discuss our current knowledge of the multiple levels at which flavivirus rna synthesis is controlled.  rna synthesis and replication of the members of the flavivirus genus (including dengue, west nile and japanese encephalitis viruses) is regulated by a wide variety of mechanisms and actors.  replication of hepadnaviruses involves reverse transcription of an intermediate rna molecule.  in the case of flaviviruses, a model has been proposed that involves the recognition of an rna element present at the viral 5' untranslated region, stem-loop a (sla), that serves as a promoter for ns5 polymerase binding and activity.  this process is likely to be carried out by a virally encoded, multifunctional polymerase which possesses dna- and rna-dependent dna polymerase and rnase h activities. ||| ",Yes
Is ABCE1 involved in ribosomal recycling?,Yes,"The ATP-binding cassette (ABC) protein ABCE1 is a crucial factor in ribosome recycling during translation. It is a unique member of the ABC superfamily, bearing two Fe₄S₄ clusters, and is essential for ribosomal biogenesis and recycling. The process of ribosome recycling orchestrated by ABCE1 is a fundamental process in protein translation and mRNA surveillance, connecting termination with initiation. Recent studies have identified ABCE1 as a ribosome-recycling factor important for translation termination in mammalian cells, yeast, and archaea. The twin-ATPase ABCE1 has a vital function in mRNA translation by recycling terminated or stalled ribosomes. Its role in translation initiation and/or ribosome biosynthesis makes it essential for life. The dynamic behavior of structural motifs unique to ABCE1 ultimately leads to ribosome splitting.","the atp-binding cassette (abc) protein abce1 is an essential factor in ribosome recycling during translation.  the data demonstrate that the ribosomal stalk protein likely participates in efficient actions of both archaeal and eukaryotic abce1 in ribosome recycling.  the abce1 atpase, a unique abc superfamily member that bears two fe₄s₄ clusters, is crucial for ribosomal biogenesis and recycling.  ribosome recycling orchestrated by abce1 is a fundamental process in protein translation and mrna surveillance, connecting termination with initiation.  to study the function of rli1/abce1 in vivo, we used ribosome profiling and biochemistry to characterize its contribution to ribosome recycling.  recent studies have identified abce1 as a ribosome-recycling factor important for translation termination in mammalian cells, yeast and also archaea.  here, we define how allosterically coupled atp binding and hydrolysis events in abce1 empower ribosome recycling.  based on these data, we propose a refined model of how signals from the ribosome are integrated into the atpase cycle of abce1 to orchestrate ribosome recycling.  here, we reveal the ancestral role and mechanistic principles of the newly identified twin-atpase abce1 in ribosome recycling.  ribosome recycling by the twin-atpase abce1 is a key regulatory process in mrna translation and surveillance and in ribosome-associated protein quality control in eukarya and archaea.  by direct (11) interaction, the peptide release factor arf1 is shown to synergistically promote abce1 function in posttermination ribosome recycling.  ribosome recycling orchestrated by the atp binding cassette (abc) protein abce1 can be considered as the final-or the first-step within the cyclic process of protein synthesis, connecting translation termination and mrna surveillance with re-initiation.  atp-binding cassette sub-family e member 1 (abce1) is recognized as a strongly conserved ribosome recycling factor, indispensable for translation in archaea and eukaryotes, however, its role in plants remains largely unidentified.  the twin-atpase abce1 has a vital function in mrna translation by recycling terminated or stalled ribosomes.  because of its fundamental role in translation initiation and/or ribosome biosynthesis, abce1 is essential for life.  the structure reveals the dynamic behavior of structural motifs unique to abce1, which ultimately leads to ribosome splitting.  the abc protein abce1, formerly named rnase l inhibitor rli1, is one of the most conserved proteins in evolution and is expressed in all organisms except eubacteria.  meaningfully, the observed structural requirements of atabce2 for rna silencing suppression were found to be similar to those of archaeal abce1 needed for ribosome recycling.  the key role of abce1, and what is known about the structure and function of this versatile protein, is discussed.  atabce2 might therefore suppress rna silencing via supporting the competing rna degradation mechanisms associated with ribosome recycling. ||| ",Yes

Is there a role for the cylindromatosis tumor suppressor (CYLD) in lung cancer?,Yes,"The cylindromatosis tumor suppressor (CYLD) has been implicated in the inhibition of various human malignancies, including colon cancer, and its downregulation has been reported in several malignancies. Although the clinical significance of CYLD expression in lung cancer remains to be elucidated, the loss of CYLD function has been correlated with tumorigenesis in other cancers. Given its role as a negative regulator of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and its involvement in cell proliferation and inflammation, it is plausible that CYLD may play a role in lung cancer development and progression. Further research is needed to determine the specific role of CYLD in lung cancer and its potential as a therapeutic target.","the cylindromatosis tumor suppressor (cyld) has been implicated in the inhibition of human breast cancer development by virtue of the poor prognosis of patients with down-regulated cyld expression.  the tumor-suppressor cylindromatosis (cyld) is a deubiquitinating enzyme and key regulator of cell proliferation and inflammation.  the cylindromatosis (cyld) gene is involved in tumor progression by acting as a negative regulator of nuclear factor-κb (nf-κb).  cyld is a tumor suppressor that has been linked to the development of various human malignancies, including colon cancer.  cyld encodes a tumor suppressor that is mutated in familial cylindromatosis.  cyld was originally identified as a tumor suppressor that is mutated in familial cylindromatosis.  cylindromatosis (cyld) is a tumor suppressor gene that is mutated in familial cylindromatosis, a rare autosomal dominant disorder associated with numerous benign skin adnexal tumors.  cyld is a protein with tumor suppressor properties which was originally discovered associated with cylindromatosis, an inherited cancer exclusively affecting the folicullo-sebaceous-apocrine unit of the epidermis.  this study investigated the clinical significance of cyld in breast cancer and its roles in tumor progression.  the cylindromatosis (cyld) gene was originally identified as a tumor suppressor that is mutated in familial cylindromatosis, an autosomal dominant condition that confers a predisposition to multiple tumors of the skin appendages.  cyld is a tumour-suppressor gene that is mutated in a benign skin tumour syndrome called cylindromatosis.  the cylindromatosis tumor suppressor gene (cyld) encodes an enzyme (cyld) with deubiquitinating activity that has been implicated in the regulation of thymocyte selection in an nf-κb-essential-modulator (nemo)-dependent manner.  cyld is a tumor suppressor that is mutated in familial cylindromatosis, an autosomal dominant predisposition to multiple tumors of the skin appendages.  the cylindromatosis gene (cyld) encodes a deubiquitinase that was initially             identified as a tumor suppressor and has recently been investigated in connection             with a variety of normal physiological processes.  loss of cylindromatosis gene (cyld) expression has been observed in various cancers, including chronic lymphocytic leukemia (cll).  therefore, loss of cyld function correlates with tumorigenesis.  downregulation of cyld has been reported in several malignancies; however, the clinical significance of cyld expression in many malignancies, including breast cancer, remains to be elucidated.  in order to investigate the mechanism of breast cancer suppression by cyld, in the present study, cellular and molecular aspects of cyld-dependent phenotypic regulation of different types of human breast cancer cell lines were analyzed.  the cylindromatosis gene (cyld) was identified as a tumor suppressor gene, which is mutated in familial cylindromatosis (brooke-spiegler syndrome), an autosomal-dominant predisposition to multiple tumors of the skin appendages.  thus, functional relevant loss of cyld expression may contribute to tumor development and progression, and may provide a new target for therapeutic strategies. ||| ",Yes
Is myasthenia gravis associated with osteoporosis?,Yes,"The study indicates that patients with myasthenia gravis (MG) have a higher prevalence of osteoporosis compared to controls. This association is attributed to factors such as reduced muscle strength, elevated bone resorption markers, vitamin D deficiency, and increased PTH levels in MG patients. The findings suggest that inflammatory myopathies, including MG, carry significantly elevated risks for osteoporosis and fractures.","this current study aimed to evaluate the frequency of low bone mass, osteopenia, and osteoporosis in patients with myasthenia gravis (mg) and to investigate the possible association between bone mineral density (bmd) and plasma levels of bone metabolism markers.  myasthenia gravis (mg) patients had low proximal hip bmd, which could be explained by reduced muscle strength, elevated bone resorption markers, vitamin d deficiency, and increased pth levels in those with mg compared to controls.  the prevalence of osteoporosis was found to be significantly higher in the myositis group (7% vs. 13.5%, p: 0.045), but the fracture prevalence was similar in the two groups (75% vs. 68%).  our findings suggest that inflammatory myopathies carry significantly elevated risks for osteoporosis and fractures.  the risk of osteoporosis is known in myopathies requiring long-term steroid treatment and pompe disease, but not in other hereditary myopathies or sporadic inclusion body myositis (sibm).  the prevalence of osteoporosis and risk of fractures is elevated in rheumatoid arthritis (ra), but we have limited information about the bone mineral density (bmd) and fracture risk in patients with inflammatory myopathies.  risk factors of osteoporosis, laboratory parameters of bone metabolism, frequency of falls and fractures, walking ability, and pain were surveyed using questionnaires in 89 patients with sibm and genetically confirmed myopathies facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (fshd), myotonic dystrophy types 1 and 2 (dm1, dm2), limb girdle muscular dystrophies (lgmd2a, lgmd2b, lgmd2i), matr3 myopathy, and oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (opmd).  osteoporosis is a common concomitant disease in patients with rheumatic diseases on glucocorticoid (gc) therapy.  osteoporosis is a degenerative bone disease that causes significant morbidity and mortality in multiple sclerosis (ms) patients; the pathogenesis of this disease being poorly understood in the context of ms. osteoporosis is seen more frequently in ms patients than in healthy controls matched for age and sex.  the number of prevalent fractures was significantly correlated to poorer physical function in both groups, and poorer health status in the myositis group, but not in the ra group.  patients with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (mgus) have increased rates of bone resorption, osteopenia, osteoporosis, and risk of fractures.  background glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis (giop) represents the most frequently seen type of secondary osteoporosis, a systemic skeleton disorder.  osteoporosis is regularly mentioned as a possible consequence of treatment with prolactin-increasing antipsychotic medications, but little is known about the prevalence and the degree of loss of bone mineral density in patients suffering from schizophrenia.  the prevalence of osteopenia and osteoporosis is higher amongst patients with multiple sclerosis in comparison with the general population.  low bone mass, vertebral osteopenia and fractures have been described in patients with ankylosing spondylitis (as), but the aetiology of this osteoporosis (op) remains unknown.  the risk for osteoporosis and reduced 25-oh d3 level seems to be increased in wheelchair-bound patients with myopathy but also in patients with dm1 and autosomal-recessive myopathies.  osteoporosis was demonstrated in 35.3% of the patients, osteopenia in 47.5%, and a normal bmd in 17.2%.  in female patients, a positive correlation between body mass index and bone mineral density was found.  osteoporosis (op) results in weak bone and can ultimately lead to fracture.  osteoporosis is an important risk factor for fragility fractures. ||| ",Yes
Is triadin involved in cardiac function?,Yes,"Triadin is a protein that plays a crucial role in the regulation of cardiac excitation-contraction coupling. It is a component of the calcium release complex in cardiac and skeletal muscle, and its expression is essential for normal sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium cycling and contractile function. Triadin 1, a major transmembrane protein in cardiac junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum, forms a quaternary complex with the ryanodine receptor, junctin, and calsequestrin, which are important for calcium release. The stable expression of triadin results in cardiac hypertrophy, prolonged basal relaxation, a depressed response to beta-adrenergic agonists, and altered calcium transients. These findings suggest an important role for triadin 1 in regulating the contractile properties of the heart during excitation-contraction coupling.","triadin is involved in the regulation of cardiac excitation-contraction coupling.  during the last 20 years, the identification of triadin function in cardiac and skeletal muscle has been the focus of numerous studies.  triadin is a protein expressed in cardiac and skeletal muscle that has an essential role in the structure and functional regulation of calcium release units and excitation-contraction coupling.  triadin is a component of the calcium release complex of cardiac and skeletal muscle.  this review summarizes current concepts of the impact of triadin on cardiac ec coupling with a focus towards triadin's role for ventricular arrhythmia.  novel therapeutic approaches could be aimed at correcting the loss of triadin in diseased hearts, and thereby correcting the sub-cellular ec coupling defect.  we conclude that triadin 1 is the triadin isoform most likely to play a role in ca(2+) release in heart.  triadin 1 is a protein in the cardiac junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum (sr) that interacts with the ryanodine receptor, junctin, and calsequestrin, proteins that are important for ca(2+) release.  the putative role(s) of triadin(s) will be discussed here.  triadin 1 is a major transmembrane protein in cardiac junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum (sr), which forms a quaternary complex with the ryanodine receptor (ca(2+) release channel), junctin, and calsequestrin.  our data show that the stable expression of triadin, independent of junctin expression, resulted in cardiac hypertrophy, prolonged basal relaxation, a depressed response to beta-adrenergic agonists, and altered ca transients.  our results provide evidence for the coordinated regulation of junctional sr protein expression in heart independent of free sr protein expression, and furthermore suggest an important role for triadin 1 in regulating the contractile properties of the heart during excitation-contraction coupling.  several triadin isoforms have been postulated to exist in cardiac muscle, but to date none has been conclusively identified.  triadin is a major membrane protein that is specifically localized in the junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum of skeletal muscle and is thought to play an important role in muscle excitation-contraction coupling.  although a 92-kda immunoreactive protein could be tentatively identified in myocardium as triadin 3, its expression level was insignificant (</=5%) compared with that of triadin 1.  to better understand the role of triadin 1 in excitation-contraction coupling in the heart, we generated transgenic mice with targeted overexpression of triadin 1 to mouse atrium and ventricle, employing the alpha-myosin heavy chain promoter to drive protein expression.  triadin is a protein first identified as a member of the muscle calcium release complex, involved in calcium release for muscle contraction.  in this review, we cover the roles of cardiac titin in normal and failing hearts, with a special emphasis on the contribution of titin to diastolic stiffness.  thus the maintenance of triadin expression is essential for normal sr ca cycling and contractile function.  first thought of as the missing link between the ryanodine receptor and the dihydropyridine receptor and responsible of skeletal type excitation-contraction coupling, the current hypothesis on triadin function has slowly evolved, and triadin is envisaged now as a regulator of calcium release, both in cardiac and skeletal muscle. ||| ",Yes

However, while the crystal structure of flavivirus NS5 is known, there is currently no data available regarding the quaternary organization of the functional enzyme.","flavivirus nonstructural protein 5 (ns5) contains an n-terminal methyltransferase (mtase) domain and a c-terminal polymerase (rna-dependent rna polymerase ) domain fused through a 9-amino-acid linker.  the rna-dependent rna polymerase (rdrp) from the flavivirus genus is naturally fused to a methyltransferase (mtase), and the full-length protein is named nonstructural protein 5 (ns5).  flavivirus nonstructural protein 5 (ns5) consists of methyltransferase (mtase) and rna-dependent rna polymerase (rdrp) domains, which catalyze 5'-rna capping/methylation and rna synthesis, respectively, during viral genome replication.  the flavivirus ns5 is very unique in having a methyltransferase (mtase) placed on the immediate n terminus of its rna-dependent rna polymerase (rdrp).  the flavivirus ns5 protein contains an n-terminal methyl-transferase (mtase) connected through a flexible linker with a c-terminal rna-dependent rna-polymerase (rdrp) domain, that work cooperatively to replicate and methylate the viral genome.  the flavivirus ns5 harbors both a methyltransferase (mtase) and an rna-dependent rna polymerase (rdrp).  being a natural fusion of a methyltransferase (mtase) and an rna-dependent rna polymerase (rdrp), ns5 is the most conserved flavivirus protein and an important antiviral target.  sequence motifs within the non-structural protein ns5 or ns5b of the members of the family flaviviridae suggest that this protein is the rna-dependent rna polymerase.  the flavivirus ns5 is a natural fusion of a methyltransferase (mtase) and an rna-dependent rna polymerase (rdrp).  in flavivirus ns5 crystal structures, the start of the linker forms a 310 helix when ns5 adopts a compact conformation, but becomes disordered or extended in open conformations.  reported here is the three-dimensional structure of hcv ns5b polymerase, with the highlight on its c-terminal folding, determined by x-ray crystallography at 2.1-a resolution.  in the flavivirus genus, the non-structural protein ns5 plays a central role in rna viral replication and constitutes a major target for drug discovery.  flavivirus nonstructural protein 5 (ns5) possesses enzymatic activities required for capping and synthesis of the viral rna genome and is essential for virus replication.  we report the crystal structure of dengue virus full-length ns5, where eight molecules of ns5 are arranged as four independent dimers in the crystallographic asymmetric unit.  ns5 is a nonstructural protein essential for flavivirus rna replication with dual mtase and rdrp enzyme activities and thus constitutes a major drug target.  although the crystal structure of flavivirus ns5 is known, no data about the quaternary organization of the functional enzyme are available.  the flavivirus nonstructural protein 5 (ns5) is a large protein that is structurally conserved among members of the genus, making it an attractive target for antiviral drug development.  flavivirus ns5 is the most conserved protein amongst the flavivirus proteins and is an essential enzyme for viral mrna capping and replication.  flavivirus protein ns5 harbors the rna-dependent rna polymerase (rdrp) activity.  the dengue virus (denv) non-structural protein 5 (ns5) comprises an n-terminal methyltransferase and a c-terminal rna-dependent rna polymerase (rdrp) domain. ||| ",Yes
Is oxalate renal excretion increased after bariatric surgery?,Yes,"After bariatric surgery, an increase in urinary oxalate excretion has been observed. This is thought to be due to intestinal hyperabsorption of oxalate, which contributes to elevated plasma oxalate and urinary calcium oxalate supersaturation. The mean oxaluric response to an oxalate load is markedly elevated in post-bariatric surgery patients, indicating that increased intestinal absorption of dietary oxalate is a predisposing factor for enteric hyperoxaluria. This condition is a recognized complication of bariatric surgery and can lead to chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal failure. Studies have shown that on a moderate oxalate diet, urinary oxalate excretion is 4-fold higher in patients who have undergone Roux-en-Y gastric bypass compared to sham controls. The increasing prevalence of obesity and metabolic syndrome has also been associated with an increase in urinary oxalate.","therefore, after bariatric surgery, increases in fecal fat excretion, urinary oxalate excretion after an oral oxalate load, plasma oxalate, and urinary calcium oxalate supersaturation values were observed.  we hypothesized that after bariatric surgery, intestinal hyperabsorption of oxalate contributes to increases in plasma oxalate and urinary calcium oxalate supersaturation.  bariatric surgery (bs) may be associated with increased oxalate excretion and a higher risk of nephrolithiasis.  the mean oxaluric response to an oxalate load is markedly elevated in post-bariatric surgery patients, suggesting that increased intestinal absorption of dietary oxalate is a predisposing mechanism for enteric hyperoxaluria.  enteric hyperoxalosis is a recognized complication of bariatric surgery, with consequent oxalate nephropathy leading to chronic kidney disease and occasionally end-stage renal failure.  the urinary oxalate excretion was studied for 10-13 days during enteral and parenteral nutrition in six patients operated on because of massive obesity with a jejunoileostomy.  the present study aimed to investigate the underlying mechanisms contributing to increased urinary oxalate in a mini-gastric bypass (mgb) surgery model in rats under different dietary conditions.  we report two cases of renal allograft oxalate nephropathy in patients with remote histories of bariatric surgery.  hyperoxaluria and increased calcium oxalate stone formation occur after roux-en-y gastric bypass (rygb) surgery for morbid obesity.  roux-en-y (r-y) gastric bypass, also known as bariatric surgery, sometimes causes postoperative hyperoxaluria and subsequent oxalate nephrolithiasis in obese patients.  with an increasing prevalence of obesity and metabolic syndrome in the past 30 years, urinary oxalate has significantly increased.  enteric hyperoxaluria and oxalate urolithiasis in patients with ileal resection seem to be caused by intestinal hyperabsorption of oxalate.  thus, reduced active intestinal oxalate secretion, likely secondary to local and systemic inflammation, contributes to the pathogenesis of obesity-associated hyperoxaluria.  hyperoxaluria and oxalate kidney stones frequently develop after roux-en-y gastric bypass (rygb).  studies have shown that compensatory adaptations in gastrointestinal oxalate transport can impact the amount of oxalate excreted by the kidney.  we prospectively examined oxalate metabolism in 11 morbidly obese subjects before and 6 and 12 months after rygb (n = 9) and biliopancreatic diversion-duodenal switch (bpd-ds) (n = 2).  on a moderate oxalate diet, urinary oxalate excretion was 4-fold higher in rygb than sham controls.  bariatric surgery is associated with hyperoxaluria hence predisposing to nephrolithiasis.  gastric bypass surgery for obesity is known to be associated with postoperative hyperoxaluria, which can lead to urolithiasis and kidney damage.  as the incidence of obesity and pretransplant bariatric surgery increases in the transplant population, allograft oxalate nephropathy is likely to be an increasing cause of allograft dysfunction. ||| ",Yes
Does MicroRNA-21 (miR-21) contribute to cardiovascular disease?,Yes,"Justification: The review article indicates that MicroRNA-21 (miR-21) is highly expressed in the cardiovascular system and plays a significant role in various cardiovascular diseases. It has been implicated in diabetic complications, including diabetic cardiomyopathy, and is involved in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases. MiR-21 is known to promote the development of cardiac fibrosis, hypertrophy, and heart failure. Furthermore, it has been utilized as a diagnostic tool in the assessment of heart failure, with its expression being an independent predictor of survival. Therefore, it can be concluded that miR-21 does contribute to cardiovascular disease.","this review article summarizes the research progress regarding the roles of mir-21 in cardiovascular disease.  mir-21 might be a novel therapeutic target in cardiovascular diseases.  this study is aimed at exploring the role and potential molecular mechanism of microrna-21 (mir-21) in coronary heart disease (chd).  microrna-21 has been implicated in diabetic complication, including diabetic cardiomyopathy.  the microrna-21 (mir-21) is known to play a major role in cancer progression; however, its function in the cardiovascular system appears to be even more complex and conflicting.  microrna-21 (mir-21) is a highly expressed microrna (mirna) in cardiovascular system.  it is unknown whether fibrosis-associated micrornas: mir-21, mir-26, mir-29, mir-30 and mir-133a are linked to cardiovascular (cv) outcome.  microrna-21 (mir-21) is a proproliferative and antiapoptotic mir, which we showed to be elevated in metabolic syndrome.  accordingly, mir-21 is proven to be involved in the pathogenesis of the above-mentioned cardiovascular diseases as demonstrated by both loss-of-function and gain-of-function approaches.  microrna 21 (mirna‑21) promotes the development of cardiac fibrosis, hypertrophy and heart failure.  circulating mirna‑21 has potential to be a biomarker of heart failure.  mir-21 is a microrna implicated in cancer, development, and cardiovascular diseases and expressed in the central nervous system (cns), especially after injury.  mir-21 is found to play important roles in vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation and apoptosis, cardiac cell growth and death, and cardiac fibroblast functions.  the aim of this study was to investigate the association of mir-21 with visfatin, inflammation, atherosclerosis and acute coronary syndrome (acs).  it seems that microrna-21 (mir-21) and visfatin, a novel adipocytokine, play roles in inflammation and atherosclerosis.  gain-of-function and loss-of-function assays demonstrated that mir-21-3p mediated the crucial role in diabetic cardiac fibrosis.  previous studies have demonstrated that microrna-204 (mir-204) is involved in atherosclerosis and vascular calcification.  aim: circulating microrna-21 (mir-21) has been utilized as a diagnostic tool in the assessment of heart failure (hf).  a cox regression analysis identified mir-21 expression as an independent predictor of survival (p = 0.048); a relative increase in mir-21 expression (>1) was associated with a 50% reduction in the risk of mortality.  to characterize mir-21 expression in the plasma of individuals with or without metabolic syndrome (mets), 58 mets cases and 96 non-mets controls were investigated. ||| ",Yes
Is cystatin C or cystatin 3 used as a biomarker of kidney function?,Yes,"Cystatin C is indeed used as a biomarker of kidney function. It has been proposed as a surrogate marker of kidney function and is considered a more sensitive marker of renal function than serum creatinine. Cystatin C is a cysteine protease inhibitor that has been suggested as a new marker of glomerular filtration rate (GFR). It has shown higher sensitivity and specificity than serum creatinine in differentiating chronic kidney disease (CKD) stages. Furthermore, cystatin C has been found to be a reliable marker of renal function during the immediate post-transplantation period, especially for identifying moderate changes in GFR.","cystatin c is a promising kidney function marker.  cystatin c has been proposed as a surrogate marker of kidney function.  studies have questioned, however, whether cystatin c is predominantly a measure of kidney function.  recent studies suggest that serum cystatin c (cysc) is a more sensitive marker of renal functions than serum creatinine (cr).  urinary cystatin c (u-cysc) is a new biomarker for acute tubular kidney dysfunction and may also indicate chronic tubular dysfunction.  cystatin-c is an alternative and accurate marker of renal function in kt patients showing similar diagnostic characteristics to s-cr.  thus, to assess, whether cystatin c (cysc) provides better information on renal function than other markers, cysc, creatinine clearance (crcl), serum creatinine (scr), beta2-microglobulin (beta2-m), and 125i-iothalamate clearance were determined in 30 patients.  cystatin c (cysc) has been proposed as a more accurate marker of renal function than serum creatinine (scr).  serum cystatin c, a cysteine protease inhibitor, has been suggested as a new marker of glomerular filtration rate (gfr).  the significance of cystatin c for differentiating chronic kidney disease (ckd) stages and established cystatin c-based equations estimating gfr were evaluated.  cystatin c have shown to be a renal function parameter with higher sensitivity and specificity than serum creatinine.  s(cyst) levels of 1.4, 1.7, and 2.2 mg/l respectively predicted i-gfr levels of 80, 60, and 40 ml/minute/1.73 m. in conclusion, cystatin c is a reliable marker of renal function during the immediate post-olt period, especially when the goal is to identify moderate changes in gfr.  using cystatin c, a novel serum marker of kidney function, several studies have shown that mild kidney dysfunction is associated with increased risk for cardiovascular disease and mortality.  ckd stages were more sensitively differentiated by cystatin c compared to scr, especially in moderate and severe kidney dysfunction.  we have tried to define if different kinds of kidney diseases may significantly affect the serum levels of cystatin c. four hundred and four patients were studied: 249 men and 155 women, mean age was 64.3±10.1 years.  to verify whether cystatin c may be of some use as a renal function marker immediately after orthotopic liver transplantation (olt), we compared serum cystatin c (s(cyst)), serum creatinine (s(cr)), and creatinine clearance (c(cr)) levels with the glomerular filtration rate (gfr).  serum cystatin c was recently proposed as an alternative marker of glomerular filtration rate (gfr), with a suggested better performance than creatinine.  cystatin-c (cys-c) has been proposed as an alternative marker of renal function for the estimated glomerular filtration rate (egfr), which seems to be more accurate than s-cr.  the performance of serum cystatin c as a screening marker of reduced creatinine clearance in renal transplantation was evaluated and compared to serum creatinine.  cystatin c reflects kidney dysfunction sensitively, and thus cystatin c-based estimation of gfr could provide a reliable support for clinical practice. ||| ",Yes
Do DNA double-strand breaks play a causal role in carcinogenesis?,Yes,"DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) have been identified as a central component of carcinogenesis, with a significant body of evidence suggesting their importance as lesions in the process. These breaks can arise from both endogenous and exogenous factors, including ionizing radiation and environmental carcinogens. The complexity of the relationship between the frequency of DSBs, their repair rates, and the production of chromosome aberrations has led to much debate. However, it is generally accepted that DSBs are potentially carcinogenic, although the potency of complex DSBs compared to simple breaks is still a matter of investigation. DSBs have been confirmed to result in chromosome aberrations, and while they are not sufficient to give rise to SCE formation, they are a significant factor in the development of many human diseases, including cancer.","genotoxic carcinogens which interact with dna may produce double-strand breaks as normal intermediates of homologous mitotic recombination, and may give rise to structural chromosome aberrations and inter-chromosomal deletion-recombination.  much evidence has suggested that dna double-strand breaks (dsb) are important lesions.  dna damage is recognized as a central component of carcinogenesis.  dna double-strand breaks (dsbs) are particularly lethal and genotoxic lesions, that can arise either by endogenous (physiological or pathological) processes or by exogenous factors, particularly ionizing radiation and radiomimetic compounds.  numerous environmental carcinogens involve radical formation interacting with dna to produce 2-deoxyribonolactone (dl), a major type of oxidized abasic site, implicated in dna strand breaks, mutagenesis, and formation of covalent dna-protein cross-links (dpc).  while there is general acceptance that the dna double-strand break (dsb) is the principal initiating lesion the complexity of the relationship between the induced frequency and the rates of repair and misjoining of dsb, and the production of chromosome and chromatid aberrations has led to much controversy.  although dsbs are potentially carcinogenic, it is not clear whether complex dsbs that are refractory to repair are more potently tumorigenic compared with simple breaks that can be rapidly repaired, correctly or incorrectly, by mammalian cells.  although there was some intercellular heterogeneity, these results confirm that dna double-strand breaks do result in chromosome aberrations but that these breaks are not sufficient to give rise to sce formation.  complex dna damage may manifest in double-strand breaks (dsbs) and non-dsb, bistranded, oxidatively induced clustered dna lesions (ocdls).  in the present study we investigated whether a relationship exists between dna strand breakage and base modification.  to investigate the role of double-strand breakage in sce formation, we constructed a plasmid that gives rise to one specific lesion, a staggered-end (""cohesive"") dna double-strand break.  it is reasoned that a cell deficient in dna repair is more likely to acquire other cancer-promoting mutations.  this modified dna can be repaired enzymatically, but, if not, these modifications are believed to be responsible for the initiation of carcinogenic processes.  oxidative damage to dna seems to be an important factor in developing many human diseases including cancer.  after that, newer knowledge is reviewed that (i) strand breaks are created during normal dna unravelling (by topoisomerases), during dna synthesis, and during dna repairs, and these breaks can be single- or double-stranded, (ii) breaks variously associated with unravelling, synthesis and repair can occur 'anywhere, anytime' (pre-synthesis, synthesis or post-synthesis) in the cell cycle, and (iii) the enzyme assemblies for dna unravelling, synthesis and repair which make and religate the breaks must be non-covalently tethered to the ends of the dna strands while the breaks created by the enzymes are in existence.  establishing a cause and effect relationship between initial levels of dna dsb, their repair rate or the level of residual unrepaired breaks, and cellular effects has proved difficult in mammalian cells.  single or double strand breaks, bases modifications or deletions, intra- or interstrand dna-dna or dna-protein cross-links constitute the major lesions formed in different proportions according to agents and to dna sequence context.  dna double-strand breaks (dsbs) are the most deleterious lesion inflicted by ionizing radiation.  chromosome aberrations appear to result directly from dna double-strand breaks, but the lesion(s) giving rise to sce formation remains unknown.  dna damage, arising from endogenous metabolism or exposure to environmental agents, may perturb the transmission of genetic information by blocking dna replication and/or inducing mutations, which contribute to the development of cancer and likely other human diseases. ||| ",Yes
Can radius fracture cause carpal tunnel syndrome?,Yes,"Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is a condition that arises from the compression of the median nerve as it passes through the carpal tunnel in the wrist. This compression can be caused by various factors, including fractures and fracture-dislocations about the wrist. In particular, distal radius fractures can lead to post-traumatic edema in the carpal canal, which can generate excessive pressure on the median nerve. This can result in the loss of median nerve function or the development of a neuropathic pain syndrome. Furthermore, a rare case of CTS due to a solitary osteochondroma arising from the metaphysis of the distal radius has been reported. Therefore, it is possible for a radius fracture to cause CTS.","the purpose of this study was to assess the relationship between carpal tunnel syndrome and concomitant degenerative osteoarthritis of the wrist or basal thumb joint.  carpal tunnel syndrome disrupts kinematics of the thumb during opposition and circumduction despite normal pinch strength.  acute carpal tunnel syndrome, which is much less common, is more often directly related to fractures and fracture-dislocations about the wrist, hemorrhagic conditions, and vascular disorders involving the wrist.  loss of median nerve function or a neuropathic pain syndrome may occur in around 20% of distal radius fractures if post-traumatic oedema in the carpal canal generates excessive pressure on the median nerve.  except for scaphotrapeziotrapezoid location, degenerative osteoarthritis of the wrist was significantly linked with carpal tunnel syndrome, whereas there was no significant difference between case and control groups for prevalence of basal osteoarthritis of the thumb.  carpal tunnel syndrome is a neuropathy resulting from compression of the median nerve as it passes through a narrow tunnel in the wrist on its way to the hand.  although carpal tunnel syndrome associated with injury to the wrist is common, it is possible to overlook symptoms of median nerve compression caused by an ascending tenosynovitis secondary to trauma distal to the wrist.  the unusual presence of the radial artery within the carpal tunnel could be a contributing factor to the development of carpal tunnel syndrome.  motion deficits were observed for patients with carpal tunnel syndrome even though maximum pinch strength was similar.  carpal tunnel syndrome is the most common nerve compression disorder of the upper extremity, and it is traditionally considered a peripheral neuropathy associated with a localized compression of the median nerve just at the level of the carpal tunnel.  the objective of this review is to compare the efficacy of surgical treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome with non-surgical treatment in improving clinical outcome.  in contrast, degenerative osteoarthritis of the wrist was strongly associated with carpal tunnel syndrome, suggesting a causal relation.  carpal tunnel syndrome (cts) is the most common entrapment neuropathy occurring in upper limbs.  a rare case of carpal tunnel syndrome due to solitary osteochondroma arising from the metaphysis of the distal radius is presented.  the purpose of this work is to see if changes in the elasticity of the transverse carpal ligament may cause carpal tunnel syndrome.  carpal tunnel syndrome is usually caused by compression of the median nerve due to synovial swelling, tumor, or anomalous anatomical structure within the carpal tunnel.  these results suggest that basal osteoarthritis of the thumb is not a causal factor in carpal tunnel syndrome.  carpal tunnel syndrome is associated with sensory and motor impairments resulting from the compressed and malfunctioning median nerve.  the thumb is critical to hand function, yet the pathokinematics of the thumb associated with carpal tunnel syndrome are not well understood.  carpal tunnel syndrome results from entrapment of the median nerve in the wrist. ||| ",Yes
Is the microRNA 132 (miR-132) involved in brain pathologies?,Yes,"MicroRNA 132 (miR-132) has been shown to play a significant role in the pathogenesis of various diseases, particularly in the nervous system. It is involved in pro-survival, anti-inflammatory, and memory-promoting functions in the nervous system. Notably, miR-132 has been found to be consistently downregulated in Alzheimer's disease. Its dysregulation has been linked to the occurrence and exacerbation of various neural developmental and degenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and epilepsy. Additionally, miR-132 has been implicated in psychiatric disorders such as disturbances of consciousness, cognition and memory, depression, and schizophrenia. The specific molecular function of miR-132 in the central nervous system suggests its potential as a therapeutic target for various human CNS diseases.","mir-132 can influence the pathogenesis of many diseases, especially in the nervous system.  microrna-132 (mir-132) is involved in prosurvival, anti-inflammatory and memory-promoting functions in the nervous system and has been found consistently downregulated in alzheimer's disease (ad).  mir-132 is enriched in the central nerve system and is thought to be involved in neuronal development, maturation and function, and to be associated with several neurological disorders including alzheimer's disease.  recently, it has been reported that the microrna-132(mir-132) is linked with synaptic plasticity and cognitive impairment.  the dysregulation of mir-132 results in the occurrence and exacerbation of neural developmental, degenerative diseases, like alzheimer's disease, parkinson's disease and epilepsy, neural infection and psychiatric disorders including disturbance of consciousness, cognition and memory, depression and schizophrenia.  this review aims to discuss the clinical potentials of mir-132 in the nervous system.  microrna-132 (mir-132) has been shown to participate in many diseases.  microrna-132 (mir-132) has been demonstrated to affect multiple neuronal functions, including dendritic growth and spinogenesis in cultured neurons and brain slices, as well as learning behavior of animals.  whether and how mir-132 contributes to pathology in these neurodegenerative diseases remains unclear.  recently, the link between dysregulation of mir-124 and cns disorders, such as neurodegeneration, cns stress, neuroimmune disorders, stroke, and brain tumors, has become evident.  as a brain-specific mirna, mir-132 has been well studied in mature neurons.  this study aimed to understand the correlation between the level of mir-132 and the severity of dementia post-ischemic stroke.  in this study, we explored the role of mir-130b in cerebral ischemia injury and investigated its potential mechanism.  in addition to its documented neuronal functions, an emerging role for mir-132 in tumorigenesis has been suggested.  mir-132 could impair neuronal differentiation but promote glial cell differentiation by regulating mecp2 expression.  in the nervous system, mir-132 is significant for regulating neuronal differentiation, maturation and functioning, and widely participates in axon growth, neural migration, and plasticity.  these results indicated that there was a substantial correlation between serum mir-132 expression and post-stroke cognitive functionality, suggesting that mir-132 may be a risk marker for psci.  collectively, our results suggest that mir137 plays essential roles in postnatal neurodevelopment and that dysregulation of mir-137 potentially contributes to neuropsychiatric disorders in humans.  here, we provide an overview of the specific molecular function of mir-124 in the cns and a revealing insight for the therapeutic potential of mir-124 in the treatment of human cns diseases.  microrna-134 (mir-134) has been reported to be a brain-specific mirna and is differently expressed in brain tissues subjected to ischemic injury. ||| ",Yes
Are long non coding RNAs spliced?,Yes,"Justification: Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a diverse class of RNAs that share many structural characteristics with mRNAs, including the presence of a poly-A tail, 5'-capping, and a promoter structure. While not all lncRNAs exhibit these features, some do undergo splicing, a process in which introns are removed from the primary transcript and exons are joined together. This is supported by the context, which mentions that eukaryotic cells contain small, highly abundant, nuclear-localized non-coding RNAs that play important roles in splicing of introns from primary genomic transcripts. Additionally, the context notes that transcriptionally non-co-linear (ncl) transcripts can originate from trans-splicing (trans-spliced RNA) or cis-backsplicing (circular RNA), further supporting the idea that some lncRNAs are spliced.","while there exist some long non-coding rnas (lncrnas) that are structurally similar to mrnas (capped, spliced, poly a tail), not all of the lncrnas exhibit these features.  long non-coding rnas (lncrnas) are untranslated transcripts with longer than 200 nucleotides (nt), which possess many of the structural characteristics of mrnas, including a poly a tail, 5'-capping, and a promoter structure, but no conserved open reading frame.  long non-coding rnas (lncrnas) are functional rnas longer than 200 nucleotides in length.  long noncoding rnas (lncrnas) are noncoding transcripts usually longer than 200 nts that have recently emerged as one of the largest and significantly diverse rna families.  long noncoding rnas (lncrnas) are arbitrarily defined as rna genes larger than 200 nt in length that have no apparent coding potential.  long non-coding rna (lncrnas) are functional rna segments longer than 200 nucleotides, which are considered a redundant transcriptional product.  long non-coding rnas (lncrnas) are untranslated regulatory transcripts longer than 200 nucleotides that can play a role in transcriptional, post-translational, and epigenetic regulation.  long non-coding rnas (lncrnas) represent a class of riboregulators that either directly act in long form or are processed into shorter micrornas (mirnas) and small interfering rnas.  this review guides the reader through important aspects of non-coding rna biology.  the non-coding rna (ncrna) are generally classified, based on length, into small ncrnas less than 200 nucleotides, such as mirna, and long ncrna (lnrna) with more than 200 nucleotides.  non-coding rnas (ncrnas) are functional ribonucleic acid (rna) species that include micrornas (mirs), a class of short non-coding rnas (∼21-25 nucleotides), and long non-coding rnas (lncrnas) consisting of more than 200 nucleotides.  long intergenic noncoding rnas (lincrnas) have been suggested as playing important roles in human gene regulation.  eukaryotic cells contain small, highly abundant, nuclear-localized non-coding rnas  which play important roles in splicing of introns from primary genomic transcripts.  transcriptionally non-co-linear (ncl) transcripts can originate from trans-splicing (trans-spliced rna; 'tsrna') or cis-backsplicing (circular rna; 'circrna').  non-coding rnas (ncrnas) are untranslated rna molecules that regulate gene expressions.  circular rnas (circrnas) have long been considered as another type of non-coding rna (ncrna) due to the absence of the 5' cap structure.  recent experimental evidence suggests that most of the genome is transcribed into non-coding rnas.  noncoding rnas are untranslated rna molecules that can be divided into two main types: infrastructural, including transfer rnas (trnas) and ribosomal rnas (rrnas), and regulatory, including long ncrnas (lncrnas) and small ncrnas (srna).  there are several types of non-coding linear rnas such as micrornas (mirna) and long non-coding rnas (lncrna), as well as circular rnas (circrna) consisting of a closed continuous loop.  small nucleolar rnas (snornas) are a class of non-coding rnas that guide the post-transcriptional processing of other non-coding rnas (mostly ribosomal rnas), but have also been implicated in processes ranging from microrna-dependent gene silencing to alternative splicing. ||| ",Yes
Are there focused databases from which you can retrieve gene expression data on renal disease?,Yes,"The existence of focused databases for retrieving gene expression data on renal disease is confirmed.

Is DITPA a thyroid hormone analog utilized in experimental and clinical studies,Yes,"Diiodothyropropionic acid (DITPA) is indeed a thyroid hormone analog that has been utilized in both experimental and clinical studies. It is a synthetic analog with positive inotropic effects similar to thyroid hormone but with minimal systemic effects. DITPA therapy has been shown to lower serum TSH levels and, to a lesser extent, serum T3 and T4. Its effects on body weight, serum lipoproteins, and bone metabolism markers have been studied in a prospective, controlled, double-blind 24-week trial. Furthermore, DITPA has been compared with L-thyroxine (T4) in terms of its effects on chamber remodeling, cardiac function, cellular morphology, cardiac blood flow, and protein expression. Drug-induced thyroid effects have also been evaluated in organotypic models using either a rat thyroid lobe or human thyroid slices. The efficacy of DITPA in reducing body weight and lowering total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels has been demonstrated. However, it is important to note that long-term studies with DITPA have not been conducted.","diiodothyropropionic acid (ditpa) is a thyroid hormone analog that is currently in phase ii clinical trials.  ditpa (3,5-diiodothyroproprionic acid) is a synthetic thyroid hormone analog with positive inotropic effects similar to thyroid hormone but with minimal systemic effects.  ditpa therapy lowered serum tsh levels and, to a lesser extent, serum t(3) and t(4), but there were no differences in clinical manifestations of thyrotoxicosis or hypothyroidism.  consequently, effects of diiodothyropropionic acid (ditpa) on body weight, serum lipoproteins, and bone metabolism markers were studied in a prospective, controlled, double-blind 24-wk trial, which was primarily designed to assess treatment of stable chronic heart failure.  the present study tested the hypothesis that 3,5-diiodothyropropionic acid (ditpa), a thyroid hormone analog with inotropic but not chronotopic characteristics, is angiogenic in the nonischemic heart.  this study compares the effects of ditpa with l-thyroxine (t4) on chamber remodeling, cardiac function, cellular morphology, cardiac blood flow, and protein expression.  drug induced thyroid effects were evaluated in organotypic models utilizing either a rat thyroid lobe or human thyroid slices to compare rodent and human response.  dii mrna and dii activity in cultured human thyroid cells were significantly stimulated by tsh in a dose-dependent manner.  eighty-six patients (aged 66 +/- 11 yr, mean +/- sd) were randomized (1:2) to placebo or an escalating ditpa dose (90 to 180, 270, and 360 mg/d) over 8 wk until serum tsh was less than 0.02 mu/liter.  similarly, thyroid from the rat in vivo study exhibited an up-regulation of dio1, slc5a5, lrp2, and tshr.  we have studied the expression of type ii iodothyronine deiodinase (dii) in human thyroid tumors and cultured human thyroid cells to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the regulation of dii expression in human thyroid gland.  this investigation of ditpa actions demonstrated its efficacy in reducing body weight and lowering total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels.  this review illustrates the complex array of interactions of dph with multiple elements of the thyroid hormone system ranging from effects on t4 and t3 metabolism, serum protein binding, serum and cellular concentration of thyroid hormones, nuclear t3 binding and biologic actions of t3, to effects on hypothalamic and pituitary regulation of tsh.  the clinically used thiourea drugs, methimazole (mmi) and 6-n-propyl-2-thioruacil (ptu), were used to evaluate thyroid drug response in these models.  background: in numerous studies based predominantly on rodent models, administration of 3,5-diiodo-l-thyronine (3,5-t2), a metabolite of the thyroid hormones (th) thyroxine (t4) and triiodo-l-thyronine (t3), was reported to cause beneficial health effects, including reversal of steatohepatosis and prevention of insulin resistance, in most instances without adverse thyrotoxic side effects.  thyroid tumor tissue and surrounding nontumor tissue were obtained at the time of surgery, and dii expression was compared between tumor tissue and nontumor tissue in each case.  thyrotropin response to both dopamine infusion (decremental) and iv metoclopramide bolus (incremental) was greater in patients with primary hypothyroidism than that in the control subjects.  in addition, long-term studies with ditpa have not been done.  the pleiotropic function of thyroid hormones (th) is mediated by an organ specific expression of thyroid hormone transporters, deiodinases and th receptors.  thyrotropin responses to dopamine infusion (4 microg/kg/min over 3 hours) and iv metoclopramide (10 mg bolus), a dopamine receptor blocker were studied in 25 consecutive patients with primary hypothyroidism before and after achieving stable euthyroid state and compared with 15 normal age-matched controls. ||| ",Yes
Is factor XI deficient in Hemophilia C?,Yes,"Factor XI deficiency is indeed associated with Hemophilia C, also known as Rosenthal Syndrome. Hemophilia C is an autosomal recessive bleeding disorder caused by a deficiency in coagulation factor XI. This deficiency leads to a variable bleeding tendency, which usually manifests after trauma or surgery. The disorder is characterized by a poor correlation between the clinical bleeding diathesis and abnormalities in clotting assays that measure intrinsic coagulation. This brings into question the role of this serine protease in in vivo hemostasis. However, it is established that factor XI is a key component of the intrinsic pathway of blood coagulation and is an important factor in the creation of a stable fibrin clot.","inherited factor xi (fxi) deficiency, also called hemophilia c, is an uncommon autosomal recessive disorder, which is associated with a variable bleeding tendency that usually manifests after trauma or surgery.  factor xi deficiency is a rare hematologic disorder.  deficiency in coagulation factor ix, a plasma glycoprotein constituent of the clotting cascade, results in hemophilia b, an inherited recessive x-linked bleeding disorder.  hemophilia c (factor xi deficiency) affects both genders and it is usually asymptomatic, manifesting only as postoperative hemorrhage.  hemophilia a is an x-linked inherited bleeding disorder caused by deficiency of coagulation factor viii.  a deficiency of factor xi is associated with bleeding, but a role of high factor xi levels in thrombosis has not been investigated.  factor xi (fxi) deficiency is a rare autosomal bleeding disease associated with genetic defects in the fxi gene.  this brief review article summarizes the main features of coagulation factor xi and its deficiency and resumes the principle axes of research and methods used to investigate fxi functions.  factor xi deficiency is associated with a bleeding diathesis, but factor xii deficiency is not, indicating that, in normal hemostasis, factor xi must be activated in vivo by a protease other than factor xiia.  the objective of this report was to present the anesthetic protocol for patients with hemophilia c and to alert for the need of investigation in patients with a history of postoperative bleeding, when a coagulation study should e be done before any invasive procedure and, in the case of prolonged aptt, one should investigate the presence of factor xi deficiency.  hemophilia is caused by deficiencies in coagulation factor viii or ix, resulting in direct blockade of the intrinsic tenase complex and indirect blockade of the extrinsic tenase complex which is rapidly inhibited upon binding of factor xa to tissue factor pathway inhibitor.  the characterizations of the point mutations responsible for the majority of cases of severe factor xi deficiency in ashkenazi jews and subsequent epidemiologic studies have provided insight into the perplexing hemostatic abnormalities in this disorder.  haemophilia a is an x-linked bleeding disorder caused by a deficiency of factor viii.  factor xi is a key component of the intrinsic pathway of blood coagulation in vitro.  it appears that excessive bleeding in factor xi deficiency depends on the severity of the deficiency in certain situations and on the location of the hemostatic challenge in others.  the poor correlation between the clinical bleeding diathesis in factor xi deficiency and abnormalities in clotting assays that measure intrinsic coagulation brings into question the role of this serine protease in in vivo hemostasis.  factor ixchapel hill (factor ixch), an abnormal factor ix molecule isolated from the plasma of a patient with mild hemophilia b, has previously been shown to exhibit delayed activation by factor xia and calcium.  factor xi (fxi) is the zymogen of a serine protease enzyme in the intrinsic pathway of blood coagulation and is an important factor in the creation of a stable fibrin clot.  deficiency of fxi leads to an injury-related bleeding disorder and is remarkable for the lack of correlation between bleeding symptoms and fxi coagulant activity (fxi:c).  factor xi, a component of the intrinsic pathway of coagulation, contributes to the generation of thrombin, which is involved in both the formation of fibrin and protection against fibrinolysis. ||| ",Yes
Does d-tubocurarine (d-TC) induces irreversible inhibition of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) at the neuromuscular junction?,No,"The context indicates that d-tubocurarine (d-TC) is a potent competitive antagonist of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) at the neuromuscular junction. However, the competitive mechanism of action implies that d-TC binds reversibly to the receptor, as it competes with acetylcholine for the binding site. The context also mentions that the rates at which d-TC associates with and dissociates from the nicotinic receptor are still in doubt, further supporting the idea that the inhibition is reversible. The context does not provide any evidence to suggest that d-TC induces irreversible inhibition of nAChR at the neuromuscular junction.","nicotinic antagonists such as tubocurarine affect acetylcholine release from motor nerve terminals at the neuromuscular junction.  the interactions of d-tubocurarine (d-tc) with the ionic channel of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor were studied by biochemical methods in torpedo electric organ membranes and by electrophysiological methods on frog sciatic nerve-sartorius muscle preparation.  d-tubocurarine is a potent competitive antagonist of both the muscle-type nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (achr) and the serotonin type-3 receptor (5ht(3)r).  d-tubocurarine and the alpha-neurotoxins from snake venom are antagonists at the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor.  the effects of low concentrations (nanomolar) of d-tubocurarine (tc) on end-plate potential (epp) and miniature end-plate potential (mepp) amplitude, and quantal transmitter release were examined at the rat neuromuscular junction in an attempt to identify the functional role of nicotinic receptors on the nerve terminal.  analogs of d-tubocurarine were used to determine the individual effects of methylation, stereoisomerization, and halogenation of d-tubocurarine on the affinity for each of the two acetylcholine (ach) binding sites of the torpedo nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (achr) and for the noncompetitive antagonist site.  d-tubocurarine is a potent competitive antagonist of two members of the ligand-gated ion channel family, the muscle-type nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (achr) and serotonin type-3 receptor (5ht3r).  in the present study, a fine ultrastructural localization of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nachr) was attempted, using d-tubocurarine (d-tc), a quaternary ammonium compound binding to nachr.  because of the competitive mechanism of action of tubocurarine, the rate of hydrolysis of acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction may modulate its neuromuscular blocking effect.  a minimum mechanism is proposed in which d-tubocurarine competes for one of the two acetylcholine activating sites and also binds to a noncompetitive site.  it is suggested that d-tc interacts with both the acetylcholine receptor sites as well as its ionic channel sites in closed and open conformations.  1 the rates at which tubocurarine associates with, and dissociates from, the nicotinic receptor, while exerting its classical competitive effect, are still in doubt.  although (+)-tubocurarine (tc) is classically considered to be a competitive antagonist at the neuromuscular junction, kinetic details of the interaction remain unclear.  at low frequencies of nerve stimulation tubocurarine augments acetylcholine release while at high frequencies of nerve stimulation tubocurarine depresses acetylcholine release.  binding of d-tubocurarine to the noncompetitive site does not change the rate of rapid receptor inactivation, whereas binding of d-tubocurarine to the competitive site decreases the rate of rapid inactivation by displacing acetylcholine, in agreement with the observation that d-tubocurarine does not inactivate (desensitize) the e. electricus receptor by itself.  presynaptic effects of d-tubocurarine on neurotransmitter release were examined at the frog neuromuscular junction, using intracellular and extracellular recording techniques.  these results suggest that d-tubocurarine inhibits release of neurotransmitter by affecting a stage in the process of release, which occurs after the entry of ca2+ ions.  d-tubocurarine (dtc) and d-tubocurine acted as antagonists of the dopamine-induced inhibition of adrenergic neurotransmission in the isolated, perfused rabbit ear artery.  it is well established that d-tubocurarine causes fade in neuromuscular transmission during repetitive nerve stimulation but paradoxically there are many reports which indicate that the alpha-neurotoxins do not cause such fade.  we studied the competitive action of tc on the nicotinic receptor at the frog neuromuscular junction using a quantitative analysis of the generation phase of miniature endplate currents (m.e.p.cs) recorded in ringer solution (20 degrees c) under voltage clamp (-90 mv) in the absence or presence of 1-5 microm tc. ||| ",No
Is dexamethasone recommended for treatment of intracerebral hemorrhage?,Yes,"Dexamethasone, a synthetic glucocorticoid, has been evaluated for the treatment of intracerebral hemorrhage using a rat model of cerebral hematoma. It has been shown to reduce cerebral edema with only few mineralocorticoid side-effects. Dexamethasone is commonly used in neurosurgery practice, particularly in cerebral edema secondary to brain tumors, head trauma, and central nervous system infections. It has also been used to manage brain edema in patients with intracranial abscess and to treat cerebral edema associated with brain abscess. Although there is no approved pharmacological intervention for intracerebral hemorrhage, dexamethasone is usually used to treat cerebral edema. However, the use of subcutaneous heparin in acute intracerebral hemorrhage is associated with poor outcome, driven by increased residual disability. Therefore, careful consideration of the need for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis with heparin in intracerebral hemorrhage patients is recommended. If dexamethasone is used, even as a single dose during craniotomy, intraoperative blood glucose concentrations should be carefully monitored and hyperglycemia treated, particularly in patients at risk for glucose-mediated exacerbation of brain injury.","in conclusion, dexamethasone administered shortly after an intracerebral hematoma appears beneficial for the treatment of this condition.  dexamethasone was evaluated for the treatment of intracerebral hemorrhage using a rat model of cerebral hematoma induced by intracerebral injection of collagenase.  the indication for surgery in spontaneous intracerebral hematoma is given when, in spite of the administration of dexamethasone in high dosage, an improvement of the initial neurological symptoms could not be observed, or if a worsening is seen.  corticosteroids, particularly dexamethasone, are commonly used for treatments in patients with subarachnoid haemorrhage (sah) and primary intracerebral haemorrhage (pich) despite the lack of evidence.  in neurosurgery practice, dexamethasone (dex) is commonly used particularly in cerebral edema secondary to brain tumors, head trauma, and central nervous system infections.  dexamethasone has been used to manage brain edema in patients with intracranial abscess.  dexamethasone has been used to treat cerebral edema associated with brain abscess.  some studies have demonstrated the role of dexamethasone in the medical management of chronic subdural hematoma.  indication and timing of pharmacological venous thromboembolism prophylaxis in intracerebral hemorrhage patients is controversial.  indications to administer dexamethasone were either hospital brain abscess protocol or clinical presentation of cerebral edema.  patients with acute intracerebral hemorrhage (<6 hours) and elevated systolic blood pressure were included; patients received subcutaneous heparin following local best practice standards of care.  to determine whether use of subcutaneous heparin during the first 7 days after spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage increases risks of death and disability.  although there is no approved pharmacological intervention, such cerebral oedema is usually treated with dexamethasone.  use of subcutaneous heparin is associated with poor outcome in acute intracerebral hemorrhage, driven by increased residual disability.  despite the limitations of this study, and no clear relation of heparin with bleeding risk, we recommend careful consideration of the need for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis with heparin in intracerebral hemorrhage patients.  if dexamethasone is used, even as a single dose during craniotomy, intraoperative blood glucose concentrations should be carefully monitored and hyperglycemia treated, particularly in patients at risk for glucose-mediated exacerbation of brain injury.  dexamethasone has been shown in experimental studies to reduce cerebral oedema with only few mineralocorticoid side-effects.  dexamethasone, a synthetic glucocorticoid, is routinely prescribed with antineoplastic agents to alleviate pain associated with chemotherapy and reduce intracranial pressure.  current opinions regarding the use of dexamethasone in the treatment of chronic subdural hematomas (csdh) are only based on observational studies.  dexamethasone, a corticosteroid used to treat cerebral edema, is known to produce elevations in the blood glucose concentration, but the effect of a single intraoperative dose of dexamethasone on the blood glucose concentration is unknown. ||| ",No
Do patients with Pendred syndrome present congenital deafness?,Yes,"Justification: Pendred syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by congenital sensorineural deafness, goitre, and defective iodide organification. The syndrome is caused by mutations in the SLC26A4 gene, which encodes pendrin, an anion exchanger. The congenital deafness associated with Pendred syndrome is a result of mutations in the SLC26A4 gene, which lead to a defect in the development of the inner ear. The deafness is typically present at birth and is often progressive. The presence of congenital deafness is a characteristic clinical feature of Pendred syndrome, and individuals are assigned affected status based on this feature.","pendred syndrome is a common autosomal recessive disorder causing deafness.  pendred syndrome is one of the most common hereditary determined diseases in patients with syndromic sensorineural hearing impairment.  their father had recessively inherited deafness associated with dilated vestibular aqueducts and a clinical diagnosis of pendred's syndrome was made in him, which was confirmed molecularly.  pendred syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by congenital sensorineural deafness, goitre and defective iodide organification.  pendred syndrome is an autosomal recessive condition classically characterized by deafness and goitre.  pendred syndrome (pds) is characterized by profound deafness in childhood, positive perchlorate challenge, and goiter.  pendred syndrome comprises the association of severe congenital sensorineural deafness with thyroid pathology.  pendred syndrome (ps), a recessive disorder caused by mutations in the slc26a4 (pds) gene, is associated with deafness and goiter.  pendred syndrome is the autosomal recessively transmitted association of familial goiter and congenital deafness.  pendred syndrome, characterized by congenital sensorineural hearing loss and goiter, is one of the most common forms of syndromic deafness.  inherited as an autosomal recessive trait, pendred syndrome is a disease that shows congenital sensorineural hearing loss and goiter, with a positive finding in the perchlorate discharge test.  pendred syndrome is the most common form of syndromic deafness, characterized by dyshormonogenic goiter associated with sensory-neural deafness.  we report two cases in which the probands presented with deafness and a family history of a dominantly inherited auditory pigmentary syndrome, yet the cause of deafness in each proband was not associated with the pigmentary abnormalities but was a result of mutations in slc26a4, the gene mutated in pendred's syndrome.  pendred's syndrome is an association between congenital neurosensory deafness and goitre with abnormal discharge of iodide following perchlorate challenge, indicating a defect of iodide organification.  mutations in the slc26a4 gene, which encodes pendrin, cause congenital hearing loss as a manifestation of pendred syndrome (ps) with an iodide organification defect or nonsyndromic enlarged vestibular aqueduct (nseva, dfnb4).  pendred syndrome and non-syndromic recessive deafness associated with enlarged vestibular aqueduct (nsrd with eva) are caused by mutations in the slc26a4 (pds) gene.  pendred syndrome, characterized by childhood deafness and postpuberty goiter, is caused by mutations of slc26a4, which codes for the anion exchanger pendrin.  although pendred's syndrome may cause up to 7.5% of all cases of congenital deafness, the molecular basis of the association between the hearing loss and the thyroid organification defect remains unknown.  mutations in the slc26a4 gene are associated with pendred syndrome and autosomal recessive non-syndromic deafness (dfnb4).  individuals were assigned affected status based on the characteristic clinical features of pendred's syndrome, namely the presence of congenital sensorineural hearing loss and the appearance in early life of a goitre. ||| ",Yes
Does TGF-beta play a role in cardiac regeneration after myocardial infarction?,Yes,"TGF-beta, specifically TGF-β1, has been shown to play a critical role in cardiac injury, repair, and remodeling after myocardial infarction. Studies have demonstrated that TGF-β1 has cardioprotective effects in cardiac damage and can prevent cardiac fibroblast apoptosis induced by ischemia-reperfusion through the canonical (Smad3) and non-canonical (ERK1/2 and Akt) signaling pathways. Furthermore, TGF-β has been shown to improve myocardial function and contractile dysfunction in rat hearts injured by ischemia-reperfusion. Therefore, TGF-beta plays a significant role in cardiac regeneration after myocardial infarction.","transforming growth factor (tgf)-beta is a locally generated cytokine involved in healing processes and tissue fibrosis, all relevant for cardiac remodeling and the development of heart failure after myocardial infarction (mi).  transforming growth factor-beta 1 (tgf-β1) is critically involved in cardiac injury, repair and remodeling.  we investigated whether the improvement of cardiac function and remodeling after myocardial infarction (mi) by granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (g-csf) relates to acceleration of the healing process, in addition to myocardial regeneration.  previous studies have demonstrated that transforming growth factor-beta (tgf-beta) can accelerate wound healing, inhibit free radical formation and limit myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury in a variety of experimental models.  tgf-β1 has shown cardioprotective effects in cardiac damage; however, if tgf-β1 can prevent cardiac fibroblast death triggered by ischemia/reperfusion is unknown.  this study aimed to examine the effect of basic fibroblast growth factor (bfgf), which induces angiogenesis and tissue regeneration in ischemic myocardium, to prevent remodeling after surgical ventricular restoration (svr) using a rat ischemic cardiomyopathy model.  transforming growth factor-β (tgf-β) is known for its role in ventricular remodeling, inflammatory response, cell survival, and apoptosis.  anti-tgf-beta treatment before or after coronary artery ligation increases mortality and worsens left ventricular remodeling in mice with non-reperfused mi.  the future therapeutic application and capacity of secreted factors to modulate tissue repair after myocardial infarction relies on the intrinsic potency of factors and on the optimal localization and timing of a combination of signaling factors to stimulate stem cells in their niche to regenerate the infarcted heart.  our results show that tgf-β prevents a/r-induced apoptosis of cardiomyocytes and improves myocardial function in rat hearts injured by i/r.  overall, our data suggest that tgf-β1 prevents cardiac fibroblast apoptosis induced by simulated ischemia-reperfusion through the canonical (smad3) and non canonical (erk1/2 and akt) signaling pathways.  this study investigated the protective effects and molecular mechanisms of tgf-β on myocardial function and cardiomyocyte apoptosis.  furthermore, tgf-β improved i/r-induced myocardial contractile dysfunction.  in the heart, cardiac fibroblasts play a critical role in healing post myocardial infarction.  alongside pro-survival and anti-inflammatory properties, these regenerative roles, via epdcs, markedly expand the range of therapeutic benefits of tβ4 to sustain and repair the myocardium after ischemic damage.  these results demonstrate that a large dose of tgf-beta 1 given before ischemia fails to attenuate myocardial stunning in the open-chest dog, suggesting that this growth factor does not exert protective effects in the setting of reversible myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury.  recent studies suggest that g-csf prevents cardiac remodeling following myocardial infarction (mi) likely through regeneration of the myocardium and coronary vessels.  efficient cardiac regeneration postinfarction (mi) requires the replacement of lost cardiomyocytes, formation of new coronary vessels and appropriate modulation of the inflammatory response.  fibroblast growth factor 2 (fgf2) is cardioprotective in in vivo models of myocardial infarction; however, whether fgf2 has a protective role in in vivo ischemia-reperfusion (ir) injury, a model that more closely mimics acute myocardial infarction in humans, is not known.  we focus on signaling factors known for their mobilizing and chemotactic abilities (sdf-1, g-csf, scf, il-8, vegf), signaling factors that are expressed after myocardial infarction involved in the patho-physiological healing process (tnf-alpha, il-8, il-10, hif-1alpha, vegf, g-csf) and signaling factors that are involved in cardiogenesis and neo-angiogenesis (vegf, epo, tgf-beta, hgf, hif-1alpha, il-8). ||| ",Yes
Are Drosophila ultraconserved elements candidate ncRNAs?,Yes,"The study identified an ultraconserved element in the drosophila melanogaster homothorax (hth) gene that appears to be involved in the control of hth pre-mrna splicing. Additionally, a u5 snrna-like molecule was isolated, which contained a 5' segment identical to that of the canonical (major) u5 snrna but with a variant sm binding site and a distinct 3' hairpin sequence. The study also revealed striking degrees of conservation between each drosophila rna and its vertebrate cognate, and demonstrated blocks of homology among the drosophila small nuclear rnas. These findings suggest that Drosophila ultraconserved elements are candidate ncRNAs.","we have explored the role of lineage restricted targets, using drosophila, in order to better understand the evolutionary significance of microrna-target relationships.  how many intergenically encoded non-coding rnas (ncrnas) are expressed during various developmental stages in drosophila?  in a recent study that identified highly evolutionary conserved sequences in three genomes of diptera species we described an ultraconserved element found at an internal exon-intron junction of the drosophila melanogaster homothorax (hth) gene that appeared to be involved in the control of hth pre-mrna splicing.  during a large-scale effort to identify small noncoding rnas in drosophila, we isolated a u5 snrna-like molecule containing a 5' segment identical to that of the canonical (major) u5 snrna but with a variant sm binding site and a distinct 3' hairpin sequence.  as with vertebrates, ultraconserved sequences in insects appear to occur primarily in intergenic and intronic sequences, and at intron-exon junctions.  drosophila possesses the core gene silencing machinery but, like all insects, lacks the canonical rna-dependent rna polymerases (rdrps) that in c. elegans either trigger or enhance two major small rna-dependent gene silencing pathways.  our results reveal striking degrees of conservation between each drosophila rna and its vertebrate cognate, and also demonstrate blocks of homology among the drosophila small nuclear rnas, as previously described for vertebrates.  this study has taken advantage of the availability of the assembled genomic sequence of flies, mosquitos, ants and bees to explore the presence of ultraconserved sequence elements in these phylogenetic groups.  we have investigated the sequences of the major small nuclear rnas of drosophila cultured cells, with the objective of elucidating phylogenetically conserved primary and secondary structures by comparison of the data with previously determined sequences of these rnas in vertebrate species.  analysis of ucsbs in these dipterans and hymenoptera will lead to a greater understanding of their evolutionary origin and function of their conserved non-coding sequences and aid in discovery of core elements of enhancers.this study applies the phylogenetic footprinting program evoprinter to detection of ultraconserved non-coding sequence elements in diptera, including flies and mosquitos, and hymenoptera, including ants and bees.  ultraconserved sequences flanking known developmental genes were detected in ceratitis and musca when compared with drosophila species, in aedes and culex when compared with anopheles, and between ants and bees.  we compared non-coding sequences found within and flanking drosophila developmental genes to homologous sequences in ceratitis capitata and musca domestica many of the conserved sequence blocks (csbs) that constitute drosophila cis-regulatory dna, recognized by evoprinter alignment protocols, are also conserved in ceratitis and musca also conserved is the position but not necessarily the orientation of many of these ultraconserved csbs (ucsbs) with respect to flanking genes.  the early developmental stage appears to be associated with more abundant ncrnas than later developmental stages.  developmentally regulated genes in drosophila, which are conserved through evolution, are potential candidates for key functions in biological processes such as cell cycle, programmed cell death, and cancer.  contrary to the classical view, a large amount of non-coding dna seems to be selectively constrained in drosophila and other species.  recently, we identified a large number of ultraconserved (uc) sequences in noncoding regions of human, mouse, and rat genomes that appear to be essential for vertebrate and amniote ontogeny.  here, we used similar methods to identify ultraconserved genomic regions between the insect species drosophila melanogaster and drosophila pseudoobscura, as well as the more distantly related anopheles gambiae.  based on this finding, another six similar u5 snrna-like sequences were identified within the drosophila genome by sequence similarity to the invariant loop in the 5' half of u5.  recently, by searching the drosophila genome database, we also found dre-like sequences in the 5'-flanking regions of many genes with other functions.  genomic and cdna clones representing a homolog of the drosophila dnc+ gene were isolated from rat libraries and characterized. ||| ",Yes
Is STAT3 transcription factor regulated by mTORC1?,Yes,"The context indicates that STAT3 is a transcription factor regulated by mTORC1. The evidence is provided by the statement that STAT3 promotes the transcription of PTEN by directly binding to the PTEN promoter, and the fact that mTORC1 regulates diverse cell functions, including the regulation of transcription factors such as STAT3. Furthermore, the context also mentions that the transcriptional activity of STAT3 in mammals is regulated by the deacetylase SIRT1, which is also regulated by mTORC1. Therefore, it can be concluded that STAT3 is indeed regulated by mTORC1.","here we present evidence for the involvement of stat3, a known mtorc1 regulated transcription factor, in this process.  here we show that the foxo3a transcription factor is coordinately regulated by mtorc1 and mtorc2, and plays a crucial role in controlling cell proliferation.  these results suggest that mtorc1, in coordination with mtorc2, controls cell proliferation by regulating foxo3a gene expression and sgk1-mediated phosphorylation of foxo3a at ser314.  mtorc1 has emerged as a central regulator of cellular metabolism, cell proliferation, cellular differentiation, autophagy and immune response regulation.  mtorc1 coordinates cell growth and metabolism in response to environmental input, including growth factors, amino acid, energy and stress.  we demonstrate that stat3 promotes the transcription of pten by directly binding on the pten promoter.  mtorc1  regulates diverse cell functions.  these findings help explain how mtorc1 selects its substrates, how its kinase activity is controlled, and how it is activated by cancer-associated mutations.  the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mtorc1) is a key metabolic hub that controls the cellular response to environmental cues by exerting its kinase activity on multiple substrates1-3.  we also show that pi3k- and akt-independent pathways mediated by mtorc1 regulate the expression of hif1 (hypoxia-inducible factor 1) transcription factor complex.  in mammals, the transcriptional activity of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (stat3) is regulated by the deacetylase sirt1.  the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mtorc1) controls cell growth and metabolism in response to nutrients, energy levels, and growth factors.  in contrast to mtorc1, mtorc2, which is not well understood, participates in cell survival and the regulation of actin and cytokeratin organization.  mtorc2 mainly controls cell survival and migration through phosphorylating glucocorticoid-regulated kinase (sgk), protein kinase b (akt), and protein kinase c (pkc) kinase families.  mtorc1 (mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1) controls transcriptional programs that determine cd8+ cytolytic t cell (ctl) fate.  the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mtor) functions as a component of two large complexes, mtorc1 and mtorc2, which play crucial roles in regulating cell growth and homeostasis.  consistently, mtorc1 inactivation induced downregulation of serum- and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase 1 (sgk1), the kinase responsible for ser314 phosphorylation.  mtor is the catalytic subunit of mtor complex 1 (mtorc1), which integrates multiple environmental signals to control cell growth and metabolism.  the mammalian target of rapamycin (mtor) is a serine/threonine protein kinase which associates with regulatory-associated protein of tor (raptor), forming the mtorc1 complex, which is necessary for activation of the mtor pathway.  together, our data reveal a novel mechanism of mtorc1 activation that mediates optimal cd8+ t-cell function and antiviral activity. ||| ",Yes
Have C12orf65 mutations been associated with axonal neuropathy and optic atrophy?,Yes,"C12orf65 mutations have been associated with a spectrum of phenotypes, including early onset optic atrophy and peripheral neuropathy, which is a type of axonal neuropathy. The study identified novel C12orf65 disease-causing mutations in seven affected individuals originating from two consanguineous families. The triad of optic atrophy, axonal neuropathy, and spastic paraparesis has been highlighted as the key clinical features of C12orf65 defects. The C12orf65 gene participates in the process of mitochondrial translation, and defective mitochondrial function attributed to mutations in this gene causes primarily optic atrophy and, less commonly, neurodegenerative syndromes.","our study broadens the phenotypic spectrum of c12orf65 defects and highlights the triad of optic atrophy, axonal neuropathy and spastic paraparesis as its key clinical features.  c12orf65 participates in the process of mitochondrial translation and has been shown to be associated with a spectrum of phenotypes, including early onset optic atrophy, progressive encephalomyopathy, peripheral neuropathy, and spastic paraparesis.we used whole-genome homozygosity mapping as well as exome sequencing and targeted gene sequencing to identify novel c12orf65 disease-causing mutations in seven affected individuals originating from two consanguineous families.  additional neurological features have recently been described in seven families transmitting pathogenic mutations in opa1, the most common cause of autosomal dominant optic atrophy.  optic atrophy type 1, caused by mutations in the opa1 gene is believed to be the most common hereditary optic neuropathy, and most patients inherit a mutation from an affected parent.  defective mitochondrial function attributed to optic atrophy 1 (opa1) mutations causes primarily optic atrophy and, less commonly, neurodegenerative syndromes.  optic nerve atrophy represents the most common form of hereditary optic neuropathies leading to vision impairment.  to review the molecular genetic basis of primary inherited optic neuropathies.  few cases harboring compound heterozygous opa1 mutations have been described manifesting complex neurodegenerative disorders in addition to optic atrophy.  inherited optic neuropathies are a genetically diverse group of disorders that present with reduced visual acuity and the clinical appearance of optic atrophy.  in four family members affected with childhood-onset optic atrophy accompanied by slowly progressive peripheral neuropathy and spastic paraparesis, we identified a homozygous frame shift mutation c.413_417 delaacaa, which predicts a truncated protein lacking the c-terminal portion.  mild optic neuropathy has been associated with spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (sca1), but macular dysfunction has been reported in only 2 cases.  hereditary optic neuropathies comprise a group of clinically and genetically heterogeneous disorders.  in this review, the natural history of the common inherited optic neuropathies, the presumed pathogenesis of several of these disorders, and the literature to date regarding potential therapies are summarized.  heterozygous mutations in opa1 are a common cause of autosomal dominant optic atrophy, sometimes associated with extra-ocular manifestations.  in this large multi-centre study of 104 patients from 45 independent families, including 60 new cases, we show that extra-ocular neurological complications are common in opa1 disease, and affect up to 20% of all mutational carriers.  in the second family, we studied three affected individuals who presented with early onset optic atrophy, peripheral neuropathy, and spastic gait in addition to moderate intellectual disability.  mutations in nuclear or mitochondrial dna may cause disorders of neuro-ophthalmic significance.  a gene for recessive optic atrophy (opa3) has also been identified.  the recently described bosch-boonstra-schaaf optic atrophy (bbsoa) syndrome denotes an autosomal dominant genetic form of neuropathy caused by mutations or deletions in the nr2f1 gene.  the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the hereditary optic neuropathies involve mitochondrial dysfunction owing to mutations in mitochondrial or nuclear dna that encodes proteins essential to mitochondrial function. ||| ",Yes
Can the iPS cell technology be used in Fanconi anemia therapy?,Yes,"The iPS cell technology can be used in Fanconi anemia therapy, as iPS cells can be generated from patients with specific diseases, including FA, by the transduction of reprogramming factors. These cells can serve as a source for cell transplantation therapy for various diseases with impaired organs. The technology has the potential to provide an unlimited source of autologous cells for advanced treatments such as gene therapy. Genetic correction, molecular characterization, and successful engraftment of iPS-derived cells may offer an attractive alternative to current hematopoietic stem cell-targeted gene therapy in some monogenic diseases, including FA. However, it is important to note that the safety of iPS derivation has not been completely validated, and there are still many hurdles to overcome before clinical applications.","induced pluripotent stem cells (ipscs) represent an invaluable tool in a chromosomal instability syndrome such as fanconi anemia (fa), as they can allow to study of the molecular defects underlying this disease.  patient-specific ips cells have been derived not only for disease modeling but also as sources for cell replacement therapy.  generation of fanconi anemia (fa) patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells (ipscs) has been reported to be technically challenging due to the defects in the fa-pathway in the patients' somatic cells.  we focused on the use of ipscs for cell-based therapy of haemophilia.  although the safety of ipsc derivation has not been completely validated, anucleate cells, such as platelets or erythrocytes, derived from ipscs are promising targets.  induced pluripotent stem (ips) cells may be of use in regenerative medicine.  although cell therapy using ipsc-derived cells still has many hurdles to overcome before clinical applications, disease analysis using patient-specific ipscs may be of practical use in the near future.  fanconi anemia (fa) is a rare inherited genomic instability syndrome representing one of the best examples of hematopoietic stem cell deficiency.  but the greatest impact of ipscs may be in bone marrow failure diseases, as ipscs could represent an unlimited source of autologous cells to apply in advanced treatments such as gene therapy.  the technology to develop endoderm-derived human ips cell lines, together with other established cell lines, will provide a foundation for elucidating the mechanisms of cellular reprogramming and for studying the safety and efficacy of differentially originated human ips cells for cell therapy.  coupled with the biotechnologies of cell therapy or tissue engineering, ipsc technology will enormously contribute to human regenerative medicine.  induced pluripotent stem cells (ipscs) are a promising tool for regenerative medicine.  induced pluripotent stem cells (ipscs) can be generated from patients with specific diseases by the transduction of reprogramming factors and can be useful as a cell source for cell transplantation therapy for various diseases with impaired organs.  our data suggest that ipscs could be an attractive and prospective autologous cell source for the production of coagulation factor, and that engineered ipscs expressing coagulation factor might provide a cell-based therapeutic strategy appropriate for haemophilia.  since the first publications describing the generation of ipscs from human tissue in 2007, a phase i/iia clinical trial testing an autologous ipsc-derived cell therapy has been initiated in the u.s., and several other autologous ipsc-based therapies have advanced through various stages of development.  induced pluripotent stem cell (ipsc) technology offers a practically infinite and ethically acceptable source to obtain a variety of somatic cells.  for the study of liver disease pathogenesis, this technology also provides a potentially more amenable system for generating liver disease-specific ips cells.  the breakthrough of induced pluripotent stem cell (ipsc) technology has raised the possibility that patient-specific ipscs may become a renewable source of autologous cells for cell therapy without the concern of immune rejection.  the discovery of ipscs has led to the ex vivo production of differentiated cells for regenerative medicine.  ultimately, genetic correction, molecular characterization and successful engraftment of ipsc-derived cells may provide an attractive alternative to current hematopoietic stem cell-targeted gene therapy in some monogenic diseases, including fa. ||| ",Yes

Is there an association between TERT promoter mutation and survival of glioblastoma patients?,Yes,"The TERT promoter mutation has been found to be associated with the survival of glioblastoma patients. The mutation is a promising biomarker for predicting worse prognosis for patients with gliomas, and its prognostic value is dependent on tumor grade and IDH mutational status. A meta-analysis of 11 studies suggested that TERT promoter mutations were significantly associated with worse prognosis of patients with gliomas. The mutation is preferentially present in glioblastoma and IDH-wt gliomas and is associated with poor prognosis. TERT promoter mutations were detected in 101 glioma samples and were found to be significantly associated with compromised overall survival and progression-free survival in glioma patients. The mutation maintained its ability of inducing high transcriptional activity even under hypoxic and TMZ treatment conditions, and the presence of mutations was associated with poor prognosis in glioma patients.","in this study we investigated the tert promoter mutations and their impact on patient survival in world health organization grade iv glioblastoma multiforme (gbm).  these findings demonstrate that tert promoter mutations are novel prognostic markers for gliomas that can inform prospective therapeutic strategies.  in conclusion, tert promoter mutation is a promising biomarker for predicting worse prognosis for patients with gliomas.  the occurrence of tert promoter mutations in gliomas is frequent.  prognostic value of tert promoter mutations in gliomas is dependent on tumor grade and the idh mutational status.  tert promoter mutations were specific to gliomas.  hazard ratios from survival analysis of glioma patients were determined relative to the presence of tert promoter mutations.  our results showed that tert promoter mutation was associated with a superior outcome in mgmt-methylated gliomas (hr = 0.73; 95% ci = 0.55-0.98; p-value = 0.04), whereas this mutation was associated with poorer survival in gliomas without mgmt methylation (hr = 1.86; 95% ci = 1.54-2.26; p-value < 0.001).  there are controversial results concerning the prognostic implication of tert promoter mutation in glioma patients concerning mgmt status.  meta-analysis of total 11 studies suggested that tert promoter mutations were significantly associated with worse prognosis of patients with gliomas (hr = 2.07, 95% ci = 1.58-2.71, p < 0.00001).  meta-analysis of nine studies with adjusted outcomes suggested that tert promoter mutations were independently associated with worse prognosis of patients with gliomas (hr = 2.28, 95% ci = 1.72-3.01, p < 0.00001).  tert mutation is preferentially present in glioblastoma and idh-wt gliomas and is associated with poor prognosis.  tert promoter mutations were detected in 101 glioma samples (grades i-iv) and 49 other brain tumors by sequencing.  our study shows that the tert gene is a valuable prognostic and predictive biomarker of glioma, and tert gene polymorphisms are significantly associated with an increased risk of glioma.  tert mutation is significantly associated with compromised overall survival (os) (hr=1.38; 95% ci=1.15-1.67) and progression-free survival (pfs) (hr=1.31; 95% ci=1.06-1.63) in glioma patients.  human telomerase reverse transcriptase (tert) promoter mutations are important genetic alterations in many kinds of human malignancies, including glioma.  tert promoter mutations maintained its ability of inducing high transcriptional activity even under hypoxic and tmz treatment conditions, and the presence of mutations was associated with poor prognosis in glioma patients.  the clinical significance of telomerase reverse transcriptase (tert) promoter mutation in glioma remains unclear.  the current study aimed to investigate the anatomical specificity of tert promoter mutations in glioblastomas (gbms).  mutations in the promoter region of the telomerase reverse transcriptase gene (tertp) are associated with diagnosis and poor prognosis in gliomas. ||| ",Yes
Is the regulation of Vsr endonuclease independent of the growth phase of bacteria?,No,"The regulation of Vsr endonuclease is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, the context does indicate that the expression of many virulence-associated genes in Streptococcus pyogenes is controlled in a growth phase-dependent manner. Additionally, the results provide further evidence that Rgg contributes to growth phase-dependent gene regulation in strain Nz131. Given that the regulation of other enzymes and genes is dependent on the growth phase, it can be inferred that the regulation of Vsr endonuclease may also be dependent on the growth phase of bacteria.","the expression of many virulence-associated genes in streptococcus pyogenes is controlled in a growth phase-dependent manner.  infection of escherichia coli with bacteriophage t7 results in an inhibition of the host exonuclease v (recb, c dnase) activity.  while rnase j1 is the first bacterial exoribonuclease with 5'-to-3' processivity, rnase y is the founding member of a novel class of endoribonucleases.  the post-transcriptional regulator csra regulates multiple unrelated processes such as central carbon metabolism, motility, biofilm formation and bacterial virulence in different bacteria.  non-differentiating bacteria adapt to starvation induced growth arrest by a complex turn-on/turn-off pattern of protein synthesis.  alternative transcription factor sigma b of bacillus subtilis controls a stationary-phase regulon induced under growth conditions that do not favor sporulation.  srnas in bacteria can affect important processes, such as metabolism and virulence.  by contrast, gram-positive bacteria do not possess several important players of e. coli rna degradation, most notably the essential enzyme rnase e. recent research on the model gram-positive organism, bacillus subtilis, has identified the essential rnases j1 and y as crucial enzymes in rna degradation.  growth defect of the δacsr strain in acetate-minimal medium was restored by complementation.  vpsr, the master regulator of biofilm formation in vibrio cholerae, is an atypical ntrc1 type bebp lacking residues essential for σ54-rnap binding and rec domain phosphorylation.  studies of bacillus subtilis rnases that are involved in mrna degradation reveal a different pattern from that of escherichia coli.  the results provide further evidence that rgg contributes to growth phase-dependent gene regulation in strain nz131.  here, we show that the b. subtilis yvaj gene encodes a second 3'-to-5' exoribonuclease.  this study indicates that the vars/vara system plays a role in v. vulnificus metabolism via regulating acsr, which in turn controls acetate metabolism by activating the transcription of the acetyl-coa synthetase gene.  this contribution also discusses the diversity of the differentiation-like response to starvation in different bacteria and whether a general starvation induced programme exists.  the existence of another, as yet unknown, 3'-to-5' exoribonuclease in b. subtilis is suggested.  this review presents a model, based on recent published data, of rna degradation in b. subtilis.  subsequent bacterial adherence and motility assays showed that inactivation of csra in ehec o157:h7 resulted in a significant increase in bacterial adherence to host epithelial cells, with a concomitant loss of swimming motility on semi-solid agar plates.  degradation is initiated by rnase y-dependent endonucleolytic cleavage, followed by processive exoribonucleolysis of the generated fragments both in 3'-to-5' and in 5'-to-3' directions.  well-characterized examples of spatial regulation are less common in bacteria. ||| ",No
Is Ctf4 involved in sister chromatid cohesion establishment?,Yes,"The context indicates that Ctf4 is a highly conserved gene product required for both DNA replication and the establishment of sister chromatid cohesion. It is reported to function in DNA metabolism and sister chromatid cohesion in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Ctf4, along with Ctf8 and a helicase encoded by Chl1, are required for efficient sister chromatid cohesion in unperturbed mitotic cells. The involvement of the alternative RF-C(Ctf18/Dcc1/Ctf8) complex in sister chromatid cohesion is suggested to be highly conserved. Ctf4 is also required to maintain sister-chromatid cohesion in cells arrested for long periods in mitosis. The results suggest that Ctf18-RFC enriches and balances PCNA levels at the replication fork, beyond the needs of DNA replication, to promote establishment of sister chromatid cohesion. Ctf4 is essential for cohesion between sister centromeres during meiosis. Taken together, these findings propose an evolutionarily conserved mechanism in which Ctf4 contributes to the establishment of sister chromatid cohesion.","ctf4/and-1 is a highly conserved gene product required for both dna replication and the establishment of sister chromatid cohesion.  ctf4p (chromosome transmission fidelity) has been reported to function in dna metabolism and sister chromatid cohesion in saccharomyces cerevisiae.  we show here that ctf8, ctf4 and a helicase encoded by chl1 are required for efficient sister chromatid cohesion in unperturbed mitotic cells, and provide evidence that chl1 functions during s-phase.  it also plays a role in the establishment of sister chromatid cohesion.  here, we show that ctf18-rfc's role in sister chromatid cohesion correlates with pcna loading but is separable from its role in the replication checkpoint.  our finding that mutants in fission yeast ctf18 and dcc1 have similar defects suggests that the involvement of the alternative rf-c(ctf18/dcc1/ctf8) complex in sister chromatid cohesion might be highly conserved.  in budding yeast, a specialized replication factor c called rf-c(ctf18/dcc1/ctf8) and the dna-polymerase-alpha-associated protein ctf4 are required to maintain sister-chromatid cohesion in cells arrested for long periods in mitosis.  in addition to mediating sister chromatid cohesion during the cell cycle, the cohesin complex associates with ctcf and with active gene regulatory elements to form long-range interactions between its binding sites.  chromosome transmission fidelity 4 (ctf4) is a conserved protein required for dna replication.  cohesin is the protein complex responsible for maintaining sister chromatid cohesion.  these results demonstrate that and-1 and tim1-tipin are key factors linking dna replication and establishment of sister chromatid cohesion.  our results suggest that ctf18-rfc enriches and balances pcna levels at the replication fork, beyond the needs of dna replication, to promote establishment of sister chromatid cohesion and possibly other post-replicative processes.  cohesin acetyltransferases esco1 and esco2 play a vital role in establishing sister chromatid cohesion.  using a functional as well as a cytological assay, we demonstrate that ctf8, chl1 and ctf4 are essential for cohesion between sister centromeres during meiosis but dispensable for cohesin's association with centromeric dna.  taken together, we propose an evolutionarily conserved mechanism in which crl4s and pcna promote esco2-dependent establishment of sister chromatid cohesion.  cohesion establishment and maintenance are carried out by proteins that modify the activity of cohesin, an essential complex that holds sister chromatids together.  constituents of the replication fork, such as the dna polymerase alpha-binding protein ctf4, contribute to cohesion in ways that are poorly understood.  sister chromatid cohesion is established during s phase near the replication fork.  cohesin-mediated sister chromatid cohesion is established during the s-phase, and recent studies demonstrate that a cohesin protein ring concatenates sister dna molecules.  proper chromosome alignment and segregation during mitosis depend on cohesion between sister chromatids. ||| ",Yes
Are optogenetics tools used in the study and treatment of epilepsy?,Yes,"Optogenetics, a revolutionary research tool in neuroscience, has been successfully employed in the study and potential treatment of epilepsy.

Is there any association of the chromosomal region harboring the gene ITIH3 with schizophrenia?,Yes,"Justification: The context provides evidence of a significant association between schizophrenia and the ITIH3 gene, as well as its polymorphism rs2535629. Genome-wide association studies have repeatedly identified ITIH3 as a potential schizophrenia-susceptibility gene. The public expression data also suggests a role for ITIH3 in the development of the human brain and a cis-eQTL effect for rs2535629 and rs3617 on ITIH3 in the hippocampus. Furthermore, the context mentions that the chitinase 3-like 1 gene (CHI3L1), which is abnormally expressed in the hippocampus of subjects with schizophrenia, may be involved in the cellular response to various environmental events that increase the risk of schizophrenia. The evidence supports the association of the chromosomal region harboring the ITIH3 gene with schizophrenia.","common single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) in or near the inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor heavy chain h3 (itih3) gene have been repeatedly associated with schizophrenia and related psychiatric disorders in genome-wide association studies.  a recent genome-wide analysis indicated that a polymorphism (rs2535629) of itih3 showed the strongest association signal with susceptibility to psychiatric disorders in caucasian populations.  here, we provide the first study to assess the relevance of the itih3 rs2535629 snp in response to antipsychotic medication.  several genome-wide association studies and case-control studies regarding psychiatric disorders have identified itih3 and itih4 single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps).  here, we provide evidence that the functional variants at the chi3l1 locus influence the genetic risk of schizophrenia.  in order to explore the association of itih3 with asd, the present study included three components: identifying the spatial-temporal expression of itih3 in the developing human brain using the expression data from the allen institute for brain science; examining the cis-acting regulatory effect of snps on the itih3 expression using uk brain expression consortium database; validating the effect of identified snps using a case-control study with samples of 602 cases and 604 controls.  our findings identify chi3l1 as a potential schizophrenia-susceptibility gene and suggest that the genes involved in the biological response to adverse environmental conditions are likely to play roles in the predisposition to schizophrenia.  genome-wide association studies (gwas) have identified a region at chromosome 1p21.3, containing the microrna mir137, to be among the most significant associations for schizophrenia.  the public expression data showed that itih3 may have a role in the development of human brain and suggested a cis-eqtl effect for rs2535629 and rs3617 on itih3 in the hippocampus.  the chitinase 3-like 1 gene (chi3l1) is abnormally expressed in the hippocampus of subjects with schizophrenia and may be involved in the cellular response to various environmental events that are reported to increase the risk of schizophrenia.  first, using case-control and transmission/disequilibrium-test (tdt) methodologies, we detected a significant association between schizophrenia and haplotypes within the promoter region of chi3l1 in two independent cohorts of chinese individuals.  genetic studies have found that the interleukin-1β gene (il1b, 2q13) influences the risk for schizophrenia, but the underlying biological mechanisms of the association are still unclear.  recently, mild linkage disequilibrium has been observed with a polymorphic marker that maps within the g(olf) gene and schizophrenia in families from germany and israel, suggesting that a gene mapping near g(olf) may be involved in psychiatric disorders.  interleukin-1 beta is a cytokine implicated in the development of the central nervous system and therefore its gene is a candidate gene in schizophrenia.  linkage studies have suggested a locus for bipolar disorder as well as schizophrenia in the pericentric region of chromosome 18.  synapsin iii plays a role in neuronal plasticity and maps to chromosome 22q12-13, a region suggested to be linked to schizophrenia.  our results provide further evidence for an effect of the disc1 gene on the etiology of schizophrenia and suggest that strs in the disc1 gene may be genetic risk factors for schizophrenia.  convergent lines of evidence supported itih3 rs25352629 as a susceptibility variant for asd.  disrupted-in-schizophrenia-1 (disc1) is a promising susceptibility gene for major mental illness, but the mechanism of the clinical association is unknown.  these genes may be possible candidate genes for psychiatric illness. ||| ",Yes
The TRPM2 gene is associated with development of spontaneous thromboembolism?,No,"The TRPM2 gene is not directly associated with the development of spontaneous thromboembolism. The TRPM2 gene is a member of the transient receptor potential melastatin-related (TRPM) family of cation channels and is linked to apoptotic signaling. It has been shown to be activated by ADP-ribose and contributes to the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease, and inflammatory and neuropathic pain. However, the TRPM2 gene is not mentioned as a risk factor for thromboembolism in the provided context. The risk factors for thromboembolism mentioned in the context are mutations in the thrombomodulin gene, factor V Leiden, prothrombin G20210A mutation, and polymorphism in the factor V gene named HR2.","in this article we analyse other possible risk factors for thromboembolic events in patients with carriage of ptm.  a mutation in the thrombomodulin gene is a potential risk factor for venous and arterial thrombosis.  factor v leiden (fvl) and prothrombin g20210a mutation (ptm) are the two most common genetic polymorphisms known to predispose to a first episode of venous thromboembolism (vte).  factor v leiden (fvl) and prothrombin g20210a mutation (ptm) are the two most common genetic polymorphisms known to predispose to a first episode of venous thromboembolism (vte).  a prothrombin gene mutation (ptgm) is the second common cause of inherited thrombophilia after factor v leiden.  employing statistical analysis, we found relatively high prevalence of the ptm in both, the patients with positive thrombosis history (6.9 %), as well as in the control group (2.6 %).  polymorphism in the factor v gene named hr2 has been described as a possible risk factor for venous thromboembolism (vte) development.  trpm2 is the second member of the transient receptor potential melastatin-related (trpm) family of cation channels.  the g20210a transition of the prothrombin gene has been identified as a common but probably mild hereditary risk factor for venous thromboembolism (vte).  carriers of a mutation in the prothrombin (clotting factor ii) or factor v gene have a 2- to 4-fold greater risk for venous thromboembolism than subjects without the mutations.  the main aim of this study was to identify the ptm in the patients with positive history of thrombotic events vs. control subjects.  the trpm6 rs2274924 polymorphism may be associated with susceptibility to epilepsy following stroke, and the c allele may be associated with increased risk of post-stroke epilepsy.  trpm2 is a ca(2+)-permeable cationic channel of the transient receptor potential (trp) superfamily that is linked to apoptotic signalling.  we hypothesized that trpm2 is important for visceral nociception and the development of visceral hypersensitivity.  clinical studies have suggested a potentially ""protective"" variant of the thrombospondin gene 2 (thbs2, mim*188061).  trpm2 has previously been shown to be activated by adp-ribose, which is produced by poly(adp-ribose) polymerase 1 (parp-1).  trpm2 contributes to the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease, and inflammatory and neuropathic pain.  after adjustment for other tested defects for thrombophilia, hr2 haplotype was associated with increased risk of thromboembolic events (or = 3.05, 95% ci = 1.11-8.35, p = 0.03).  we attempted to determine whether a functional polymorphism of trpm6 (rs2274924) is associated with susceptibility to epilepsy following ischemic stroke, and to further explore the effect of this polymorphism on serum levels of mg2+ in post-stroke patients.  tnf-induced trpm2 activation may contribute to cardiomyocyte cell death. ||| ",No
Are nucleosomes positioned at DNA replication origins?,Yes,"The context suggests that nucleosomes are indeed positioned at DNA replication origins. The data provides a comprehensive view of chromatin structure at replication origins and proposes a model in which the underlying sequence occludes nucleosomes, allowing for the binding of the origin recognition complex. This complex, in turn, positions nucleosomes adjacent to the origin to promote replication origin function. The presence of a nucleosome-depleted region centered next to the acs element, flanked by arrays of well-positioned nucleosomes, further supports this claim. The evidence also indicates that nucleosomal organization influences two steps of replication initiation: origin licensing and helicase activation. The origin recognition complex acts as a barrier element to position and phase nucleosomes on both sides of the origin. The findings provide novel molecular insights into the mechanisms that govern the dynamics and spatial organization of DNA replication origins.","together our data provide a comprehensive, genome-wide view of chromatin structure at replication origins and suggest a model of nucleosome positioning at replication origins in which the underlying sequence occludes nucleosomes to permit binding of the origin recognition complex, which then (likely in concert with nucleosome modifiers and remodelers) positions nucleosomes adjacent to the origin to promote replication origin function.  on average, replication origins contain a nucleosome depleted region centered next to the acs element, flanked on both sides by arrays of well-positioned nucleosomes.  the availability of genome-wide maps of nucleosome positions has led to an explosion of information about how nucleosomes are assembled at transcription start sites, but no similar maps exist for dna replication origins.  positioning of nucleosomes regulates the access of dna binding factors to their consensus sequences.  our analysis identified dna sequence properties that correlate with nucleosome occupancy at replication origins genome-wide and that are correlated with the nucleosome-depleted region.  here we combine high-resolution genome-wide nucleosome maps with comprehensive annotations of dna replication origins to identify patterns of nucleosome occupancy at eukaryotic replication origins.  nucleosomal organization influenced two steps of replication initiation: origin licensing and helicase activation.  the key genetic process of dna replication is initiated at specific sites referred to as replication origins.  our studies show nucleosomes directly modulate origin licensing and activation through distinct mechanisms and provide insights into the regulation of replication initiation by chromatin.  foci in different regions of the nucleus initiate replication at different times of s-phase, suggesting nuclear position may contribute to where and when replication begins.  we provide evidence that the origin recognition complex, which binds to the origin, acts as a barrier element to position and phase nucleosomes on both sides of the origin.  these findings provide novel molecular insight into the mechanisms that govern dynamics and spatial organization of dna replication origins and possibly other functional dna elements.  chromosomal dna replication is proposed to occur in special compartments in the nucleus called replication foci.  the results of three-dimensional confocal microscopy indicate that chorion dna replication origins are highly active in diverse positions within the nucleus.  using reconstituted nucleosomal dna replication assays, we assessed the impact of nucleosomes on replication initiation.  recently, nucleosome-nucleosome interactions were suggested as one of the factors underlying preferential nucleosomes positioning.  we also find that chorion replication origins inserted at ectopic chromosomal sites can amplify highly in diverse nuclear locations distinct from the endogenous loci, including when they are buffered against genomic position effects.  in s. cerevisiae, replication origins occupy characteristic subnuclear localizations that anticipate their initiation timing during s phase.  a key to understanding the exact features of chromatin that impinge on replication origin function is to define the precise locations of the dna sequences that control origin function.  clustering analysis of all annotated replication origins revealed a surprising diversity of nucleosome occupancy patterns. ||| ",No

Are Sidekick proteins members of the immunoglobulin superfamily?,Yes,"Sidekick proteins, specifically Sidekick-1 and -2, are indeed members of the immunoglobulin superfamily. This is evidenced by their classification as homologous transmembrane immunoglobulin superfamily molecules. These proteins are known to mediate homophilic adhesion in vitro and direct laminar targeting of neurites in vivo. The immunoglobulin superfamily is characterized by proteins that share structural similarity to immunoglobulins, and Sidekick proteins fit this description by having at least one immunoglobulin-like domain.","the immunoglobulin superfamily is a large category of proteins defined by their structural similarity to immunoglobulins.  the small members of the immunoglobulin superfamily (igsf) are a molecularly diverse group of proteins composed solely of immunoglobulin domains.  the immunoglobulin superfamily is a group of proteins, each made of one or several domains sharing key structural features with either the variable (v) or the constant (c) immunoglobulin domains.  the immunoglobulin superfamily (igsf) comprises the immunoglobulins (ig), t cell receptors (tr) and proteins that have the common feature of having at least one ig-like domain.  the sidekick (sdk) gene, first described in drosophila, encodes the single-pass transmembrane protein, sdk, which is one of the largest among igsf membrane proteins.  the immunoglobulin superfamily (igsf) is a heterogenic group of proteins built on a common fold, called the ig fold, which is a sandwich of two beta sheets.  we identify sidekick (sdk)-1 and -2, homologous transmembrane immunoglobulin superfamily molecules that mediate homophilic adhesion in vitro and direct laminar targeting of neurites in vivo.  immunoglobulin superfamily (igsf), an extensive collection of proteins possessing at least one immunoglobulin-like (ig-like) domain, performs a wide range of functions in recognition, binding or adhesion process of cells.  the immunoglobulin superfamily (igsf) is a large group of cell surface proteins that include various immunoregulatory receptors such as novel immune type receptors (nitrs), which are a family of diversified proteins found exclusively in bony fish.  many of the immunoglobulin superfamily (igsf) molecules play pivotal roles in cell communication.  these antigens bind to the fab regions of immunoglobulin molecules outside their complementarity-determining regions.  immunoglobulin superfamily (igsf) proteins are known for their ability to specifically recognize and adhere to other molecules, mediating cell-surface reception and pathogen recognition.  the i-type lectins are a subset of the immunoglobulin superfamily that are capable of carbohydrate-protein interactions.  mammalian igsf proteins such as antibodies are among the best characterized molecules of the immune system; in contrast, the involvement of invertebrate igsf members in immunity has not been broadly studied.  small immunoproteins (sips) are single-chain molecules comprising the variable regions of an antibody assembled in a single polypeptide (scfv) and joined to the immunoglobulin heavy-chain dimerizing domain.  the majority of these proteins are involved in protein-protein binding as receptors, antibodies or cell adhesion molecules.  analysis of the predicted anopheles gambiae transcriptome identified 138 proteins that have at least one immunoglobulin domain.  in silico analysis indicated that soigsf1 is a type i transmembrane glycoprotein and contains an n-terminal signal peptide sequence, a single extracellular immunoglobulin v domain, a transmembrane region, and a cytoplasmic region.  during an ongoing in situ hybridization analysis of expressed sequence tags in zebrafish we identified secreted immunoglobulin domain 4 (sid4), a gene encoding a soluble vertebrate protein composed solely of four immunoglobulin domains.  the msiglec-e cdna encodes a protein of 467 amino acids that contains three extracellular immunoglobulin-like domains, a transmembrane region and a cytoplasmic tail bearing two immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (itims). ||| ",Yes
Is DNA methylation an epigenetic modification of chromatin related to gene expression?,Yes,"DNA methylation is an epigenetic modification of chromatin that is intimately related to gene expression. It involves the addition of a methyl group to the 5' cytosine, a process that is enriched in heterochromatin but depleted at active promoters and enhancers. This modification plays a crucial role in regulating the chromatin structure and gene expression, thereby participating in various cellular processes such as embryogenesis, genomic imprinting, X-chromosome inactivation, and genome stability. Generally, methylation within a gene's promoter inhibits regulatory protein binding and represses transcription, while gene body methylation is associated with actively transcribed genes. The methylation status of certain CpG sites close to or within a gene can directly affect its expression, either by silencing or, in some cases, up-regulating transcription.","dna methylation is an epigenetic event that may regulate gene expression.  dna methylation is the most studied form of epigenetic regulation, a process by which chromatin composition and transcription factor binding is altered to influence tissue specific gene expression and differentiation.  dna methylation is a chemically reversible epigenetic modification that regulates the chromatin structure and gene expression, and thereby takes part in various cellular processes like embryogenesis, genomic imprinting, x-chromosome inactivation, and genome stability.  dna methylation is an epigenetic modification that is enriched in heterochromatin but depleted at active promoters and enhancers.  dna methylation plays an important role in the regulation of gene expression, as it is the first epigenetic modification to take place on a given dna strand.  dna methylation is a crucial epigenetic process which helps control gene transcription activity in eukaryotes.  dna methylation and chromatin structure are two modes of epigenetic control of genome function.  dna methylation (the addition of a methyl group to a cytosine) is an important epigenetic event in mammalian cells because it plays a key role in regulating gene expression.  methylation of cytosine residues in dna, the best studied epigenetic modification, is associated with gene transcription and nuclear organization, and ultimately the function of a cell.  dna methylation is a major mechanism involved in the epigenetic state of a cell.  epigenetic modification, as typified by cytosine methylation, is a key aspect of gene regulation that affects many biological processes.  dna methylation is an important epigenetic marker associated with gene expression regulation in eukaryotes.  dna methylation is a mechanism of epigenetic modification in eukaryotic organisms.  methylation of cytosine in cpg sequences of the dna in mammalian cells is an epigenetic feature regulated very exactly that bears importance for events like gene expression, dna replication, transcription and genetic imprinting.  dna methylation is associated with a number of biological phenomena, and plays crucial roles in epigenetic regulation of eukaryotic gene expression.  it is also suggested that dna methylation alters the mechanical properties of dna molecules, which is likely to affect epigenetic regulation.  cytosine methylation is a key mechanism of epigenetic regulation.  dna methylation is an epigenetic event that adds a methyl-group to the 5' cytosine.  generally, methylation within genes promoter inhibits regulatory protein binding and represses transcription, whereas gene body methylation is associated with actively transcribed genes.  it has been observed that the methylation status of certain cpg sites close to or within a gene can directly affect its expression, either by silencing or, in some cases, up-regulating transcription. ||| ",Yes
Can life style changes reduce oxidative stress,Yes,"Justification: Lifestyle changes, including dietary modifications and physical activity, have been shown to reduce oxidative stress. Increasing the intake of antioxidants through diet or supplements can alleviate oxidative damage related to lifestyle diseases. Additionally, physical exercise, even in mild forms, can enhance the antioxidant defense system. Adopting a healthy dietary mode is crucial for regulating oxidative stress and maintaining cell and tissue homeostasis, thereby preventing inflammation and chronic metabolic diseases.","reducing excessive oxidative stress, through chronic exercise or antioxidants, can decrease the negative effects induced by excessive amounts of oxidative stress.  the reduction of oxidative stress could be achieved in three levels: by lowering exposure to environmental pollutants with oxidizing properties, by increasing levels of endogenous and exogenous antioxidants, or by lowering the generation of oxidative stress by stabilizing mitochondrial energy production and efficiency.  recent findings have evidenced that diet and physical factors are correlated to oxidative stress.  thus, this paper addresses oxidative stress and strategies to reduce it with the focus on nutritional and psychosocial interventions of oxidative stress prevention, that is, methods to stabilize mitochondria structure and energy efficiency, or approaches which would increase endogenous antioxidative protection and repair systems.  indeed, oxidative stress has been associated with many metabolic disorders due to unhealthy dietary patterns and may be alleviated by properly increasing the intake of antioxidants.  our previous studies showed the possibility that activation of the antioxidative function alleviates various oxidative damages, which are related to lifestyle diseases.  it is highly possible that adequate activation of antioxidative functions induced by low-dose irradiation can contribute to preventing or reducing oxidative damages, which are related to lifestyle diseases.  we discuss the friend-and-foe role of dietary modification (including different diet styles, calorie restriction, and nutrient supplementation) on endothelium and oxidative stress, as well as the potential benefits and concerns of physical activity and exercise on endothelium and oxidative stress.  this review focuses on the links between dietary nutrients and health, summarizing the role of oxidative stress in 'unhealthy' metabolic pathway activities in individuals and how oxidative stress is further regulated by balanced diets.  identifying factors associated with reduced oxidative stress and resulting damage may guide future disease-prevention strategies.  oxidative stress plays a key role in the aging process.  phytochemicals may reduce damage from oxidative stress; the intake of these through diet could represent a strategy to lessen their pathological consequences.  oxidative stress induced by reactive oxygen species (ros) is associated with the risk of osteoporosis, and can be reduced by certain dietary antioxidants.  on the other hand, mild oxidative stress, as in case of physical exercise, can increase the antioxidant defense system.  our study explored, in a healthy population (n = 322), the relationship between oxidative status and cardiovascular risk factors.  flight exercise appeared to increase oxidative stress.  recent evidence suggests potential benefits from phytochemicals and micronutrients in reducing the elevated oxidative and lipid-mediated stress associated with inflammation, obesity, and atherosclerosis.  thus, it is quite important to adopt a healthy dietary mode to regulate oxidative stress and maintain cell and tissue homeostasis, preventing inflammation and chronic metabolic diseases.  oxidant stress has been linked to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and incident coronary artery disease.  lifestyle behaviours including low physical activity and inadequate nutritional habits in addition to genetic susceptibility and some chronic diseases compromise physiological response to free radicals and promote oxidative damage. ||| ",Yes
Is low T3 syndrome a prognostic marker in patients with renal insufficiency?,Yes,"Justification: The context suggests that low T3 syndrome is a prevalent condition among non-critically ill patients, including those with renal insufficiency. It is characterized by low serum triiodothyronine (T3) levels without elevation of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) in patients without apparent thyroid disease. The increasing prevalence of low T3 as chronic kidney disease (CKD) progresses indicates its value as a predictor of worsening CKD. In patients with end-stage renal disease, low plasma T3 may be an unsuspected expression of the inflammatory state of these patients. Low T3 syndrome has been associated with poor clinical outcomes in various populations, including those with kidney failure. Therefore, it may be a good candidate for predicting prognosis in future clinical practice of CKD.","background there are few data on the prevalence of low t3 (triiodothyronine) syndrome in patients with non-dialysis chronic kidney disease (ckd) and it is unclear whether low t3 can be used to predict the progression of ckd.  conclusions a high prevalence of low t3 syndrome was observed in ckd patients without dialysis, even in early stages (1 and 2).  low t3 syndrome is characterized by low serum triiodothyronine (t3) levels without elevation of thyroid-stimulating hormone (tsh) in patients without apparent thyroid disease, which is known to be associated with worse clinical outcomes in various populations including those with kidney failure.  the increasing prevalence of low t3 as ckd progresses indicates its value as a predictor of worsening ckd.  in patients with end-stage renal disease, low plasma triiodothyronine (t3) may be an unsuspected expression of the inflammatory state of these patients.  in conclusion, low t3 syndrome may be a good candidate for predicting prognosis in future clinical practice of cll.  low t3 levels are a prevalent condition among non-critically ill patients, and this condition is associated with poor clinical outcomes in this population.  the results showed that 37 (14.34%) patients had low t3 syndrome, which was significantly associated with unfavorable ttft and css in the propensity-matched cohort, and it was an independent prognostic indicator for both ttft and css.  to evaluate the prevalence and predictive value of low t3 levels on 30-day and 6-month mortality in non-critically ill patients.  low-t(3) syndrome is a predictor of poor outcome in patients with cardiac dysfunction.  we investigated the prognostic value of serum ft3 levels and also low-t3 syndrome on overall survival in a large cohort of hemodialysis (hd) patients with normal thyroid-stimulating hormone levels.  a correlation between low t3 and poor clinical outcomes in the intensive care unit is more established.  the relationship between t3 and hscrp suggests that inflammation might be involved in the low t3 syndrome in hemodialysis patients, but we did not find a significant correlation between t3 and hscrp levels in patients on peritoneal dialysis.  our preliminary data suggest that the low t3 state is a predictor of outcome in pulmonary patients with respiratory failure.  low t3 is related to increased early and late mortality in nste-acs patients.  in this study, we examined whether low free t3 (ft3) levels are independent predictor of cardiovascular disease (cvd) events in patients undergoing hemodialysis.  a direct association between low triiodothyronine (t3) syndrome and cardiovascular (cv) mortality has been reported in hemodialysis patients.  low t3 which is defined as decreased triiodothyronine (t3) and normal thyroid-stimulating hormone (tsh) and thyroxin (t4) levels is present in many acute diseases and is related to increased mortality.  low triiodothyronine (t3) state is associated with poor prognosis in critical acute and prolonged illness.  low t3 syndrome refers to a set of thyroid hormone metabolism alterations present in the disease state. ||| ",Yes
Are DNA methylation maps applicable to the diagnosis of non-small-cell lung carcinomas?,Yes,"DNA methylation maps have been shown to be applicable to the diagnosis of non-small-cell lung carcinomas (NSCLC). Studies have identified a number of genes that are methylated significantly more frequently in NSCLC tumors compared to non-cancerous lung tissues. Aberrant DNA methylation is a frequent phenomenon in NSCLC, and the methylation status of specific genes, such as cdkn2a, rarβ, and rassf1a, can be used to distinguish between different histological types of lung cancer and normal tissue. DNA methylation profiles have been surveyed in NSCLC patients using reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) and quantitative methylation specific PCR (qMSP) to analyze bronchial aspirates from lung cancer patients. These studies have identified several novel methylation driver genes of diagnostic and therapeutic relevance in lung cancer.

Are there any DNMT3 proteins present in plants?,No,"The context provided does not mention the presence of DNMT3 proteins in plants.

The study investigates the role of DNMT2 in stress tolerance and its interaction with other proteins, such as EIN3/EIL, E2F, and DP proteins. The context also mentions the investigation of OPT3 proteins and BURP domain-containing proteins in various plant species. However, there is no information on the presence or absence of DNMT3 proteins in plants.","this is a first report describing transcriptome and interactome of dnmt2 in any land plant.  dnmt2 is a dna/trna cytosine methyltransferase that is highly conserved in structure and function in eukaryotes.  we have previously reported that in the moss physcomitrella patens, dnmt2 plays a crucial role in stress recovery and trnaasp transcription/stability under salt stress.  dna methyltransferase 2 (dnmt2) unlike other members of the cytosine dna methyltransferase gene family has dual substrate specificity and it methylates cytosines in both the dna and transfer rna (trna).  therefore, to study its role in stress tolerance, we generated ppdnmt2 targeted knockout plants (ppdnmt2ko).  the nucleo-mitochondrial dual-localized proteins can act as gene expression regulators; however, few instances of these proteins have been described in plants.  the ethylene-insensitive3/ethylene-insensitive3-like (ein3/eil) proteins are a type of nuclear-localized protein with dna-binding activity in plants.  in this study, we demonstrate that dnmt2 from physcomitrella patens accumulates in a temporal manner under salt and osmotic stress showing maximum accumulation during recovery, i.e.  in a yeast two-hybrid screening, using wheat e2f as a bait, we have isolated a cdna clone encoding a wheat dp (tmdp) protein.  taken together, the work presented in this study sheds light on diverse roles of ppdnmt2 in maintaining molecular and physiological homeostasis in p. patens.  in animal cells, e2fs interact with dp proteins, whose identification in plants has been elusive, so far.  ppdnmt2ko, however, accumulate normal levels of dehydrin-like and small heat shock protein encoding transcripts under stress but show dramatic reduction in levels of trna(a) (sp-) (guc) .  therefore, homolog opt3 proteins in several plant species were investigated and characterized using bioinformatical tools.  ppdnmt2 possibly exists in complex with cuzn-sods in vivo and the two proteins also directly interact in the yeast nucleus as observed by yeast two-hybrid assay.  nt-tasvd and nt-sb2 plants were genetically crossed.  contrary to the specificity observed for the plant rbr/e2f interaction, human and plant e2f and dp proteins can interact in a heterologous manner.  to further investigate the role of ppdnmt2 at genome level, in this study we have performed rna sequencing of ppdnmt2.  atopt3 usually seemed to take part in fe homeostasis whereas zmopt3 putatively interacted with proteins involved in various biological processes from plant defense system to stress responses.  although systematic characterization of burp domain-containing proteins have been carried out in many species, such as rice, poplar and maize, little is known about burp domain-containing proteins in medicago.  burp domain-containing proteins belong to a newly identified protein class that is unique to plants and plays an important role in plant development and metabolism. ||| ",Yes

Furthermore, Down syndrome is associated with an increased incidence of anorectal anomalies, including aganglionosis and dysganglionosis, which are frequently described in biopsies of the distal bowel in patients with anorectal malformations. The association between Down syndrome and aganglionic megacolon has been reported in several cases, including a 48-year-old woman with Down syndrome who presented with dysphagia. Therefore, it can be concluded that aganglionic megacolon is a feature of Down syndrome.","one of the children with down's syndrome and total colonic aganglionosis died.  a case of acquired neurogenic megacolon in a child is reported.  hirschsprung's disease (hd) also called congenital aganglionic megacolon is a disorder caused by undeveloped distal to proximal intestinal nerve ganglion cells.  megacolon, the irreversible dilation of a colonic segment, is a structural sign associated with various gastrointestinal disorders.  down syndrome (ds) is recognized by characteristic facial features, intellectual disability, and an increased risk for cardiac malformations and duodenal atresia.  recently, hirschsprung disease (hscr), or congenital aganglionic megacolon, has been seen more often among patients with ds.  more recently, an association between down syndrome and achalasia was reported.  in this report, we describe a 48-year-old woman with a history of down syndrome who presented with dysphagia.  hirschsprung's disease, or congenital megacolon,is a malformation characterised by the absence of ganglion cells in the distal bowel.  down's syndrome is the most frequent chromosomal anomaly in humans and is associated with an incidence of anorectal anomalies many times greater than that found among the general population.  2 patients had a long colonic aganglionosis, 2 patients had a short aganglionotic segment and 13 patients had the common form of the disease.  dysganglionosis and aganglionosis have been frequently described in biopsies of the distal bowel in patients with anorectal malformation (arm).  the true association of total colonic aganglionosis and anorectal malformation has not been reported before.  aganglionosis was confirmed in three patients out of 53 patients with anorectal malformation.  14 consecutive subjects with idiopathic megacolon whose symptoms began after the age of 10 and a clinical history of 2-22 years.  the anorectal malformation associated with down's syndrome uniformly consists of a low-lying rectal pouch without a genitourinary or perineal fistula.  megacolon, chronic dilation of a colonic segment,is accompanied by extensive myenteric neuron loss.  the level of aganglionosis was up to the left colon in two and total colonic with ileal involvement in one.  two had down's syndrome.  subsequent evaluations confirmed total colonic aganglionosis. ||| ",Yes
Can bioprinting use human cells?,Yes,"Bioprinting is a technology that utilizes living cells, including human cells, to fabricate regenerative implants and in vitro cell culture platforms.

The technology has been applied in the construction of functional tissues such as vasculature, muscle, cartilage, and bone. However, the application of bioprinting in regenerative medicine is limited by the restricted choices of bio-ink for cytocompatible cell encapsulation and the integrity of the fabricated structures.

Is TREM2 associated with Alzheimer's disease?,Yes,"Justification: TREM2, a gene expressed in microglia, has been identified as a risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). Genetic studies have indicated that mutations in the TREM2 gene confer an increased risk of developing AD. TREM2 is thought to trigger the microglial response to amyloid plaques, a hallmark of AD pathology. Additionally, TREM2 is a microglial surface receptor that mediates the degradation disorder of amyloid β (aβ) in AD. The mechanism by which TREM2 influences the susceptibility to AD is currently unknown, but its role in modulating microglial functions in response to key AD pathologies such as aβ plaques and tau tangles is well established.","trem2 is an alzheimer's disease (ad) risk gene expressed in microglia.  recent genome-wide association studies revealed trem2 rs75932628-t variant to be associated with alzheimer's disease (ad) and other neurodegenerative diseases.  rare variants in the trem2 gene increase the risk for late-onset alzheimer's disease (ad).  trem2 is thought to trigger the microglial response to amyloid plaques.  recent genome-wide association studies linked variants in trem2 to a strong increase in the odds of developing alzheimer's disease.  trem2 is specifically expressed in brain microglia and modulates microglial functions in response to key ad pathologies such as amyloid-β (aβ) plaques and tau tangles.  triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 trem2 was identified as a risk factor for late onset alzheimer's disease (ad).  mutations in triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (trem2) have been linked to increased alzheimer's disease (ad) risk.  recent studies have found an association between a variant in triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (trem2) (rs75932628-t) and both alzheimer's disease (ad) and cognitive function in individuals aged 80-100 years.  thus, aggravated neuritic dystrophy is a more consistent outcome of trem2 deficiency than amyloid plaque load, suggesting that the microglial packing of aβ into dense plaque is an important neuroprotective activity.significance statement genetic studies indicate that trem2 gene mutations confer increased alzheimer's disease (ad) risk.  given that a single allele of variant trem2, likely resulting in a loss of function, conferred an increased risk of developing alzheimer's disease, we tested whether loss of one functional trem2 allele would affect aβ plaque deposition or the microglial response to aβ pathology in appps1-21 mice.  heterozygous triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells (trem2) mutations are an alzheimer's disease (ad) risk factor.  loss of function of triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cell 2 (trem2), a key receptor selectively expressed by microglia in the brain, contributes to the development of alzheimer's disease (ad).  triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (trem2) is a microglial surface receptor that mediates the degradation disorder of amyloid β (aβ) in alzheimer's disease.  a causative association was recently demonstrated between homozygous trem2 mutations and frontotemporal dementia (ftd)-like syndrome and between heterozygous trem2 exon2 genetic variations and late-onset alzheimer's disease (ad).  our data demonstrate trem2 as a microglial aβ receptor transducing physiological and ad-related pathological effects associated with aβ.  trem2 is expressed by microglia and is thought to regulate phagocytic and inflammatory microglial responses to brain pathology.  in this review article, we discuss recent research progress in our understanding on the role of trem2 in microglia and its relevance to ad pathologies.  the mechanism by which trem2 influences the susceptibility to alzheimer's disease is currently unknown.  background: both the genetic and pathological studies link alzheimer's disease (ad) to the triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (trem2). ||| ",Yes
Is exome sequencing efficient for the detection of germline mutations?,Yes,"Exome sequencing has been established as an efficient tool for the detection of germline mutations. This technique involves the sequencing of protein-coding regions, or exons, in the human genome. It has been shown to be an effective and affordable approach for identifying causative genetic mutations in diseases. Whole exome sequencing of patients has proven to be a cost-effective alternative to standard genetic screenings, particularly for rare Mendelian disorders with previously unknown genetic etiologies. Exome sequencing has the capability to reliably identify inherited and de novo single-nucleotide variants, small insertions, and deletions. Furthermore, it has been instrumental in uncovering somatic driver mutations for a wide range of cancers. The use of exome sequencing as a diagnostic tool is increasingly evident, and it is expected to continue to play a significant role in the identification of causal mutations in inherited disorders.","exome sequencing is an efficient tool to identify disease mutations without the need of a multi-generational pedigree.  the most sensitive technique for the detection of germline mutations is exon by exon sequencing of the gene under investigation using genomic dna as a template for analysis.  exome sequencing, which allows the global analysis of protein coding sequences in the human genome, has become an effective and affordable approach to detecting causative genetic mutations in diseases.  whole exome sequencing of patients can be a cost-effective alternative to standard genetic screenings to find causative mutations of genetic diseases, especially when the number of cases is limited.  beginning in 2009, the advent of exome sequencing has contributed significantly towards new discoveries of heritable germline mutations and de novo mutations for rare mendelian disorders with hitherto unknown genetic aetiologies.  whole-exome or whole-genome sequencing is becoming routine in clinical situations for identifying mutations underlying presumed genetic causes of disease including infertility.  with the rapid advances in high-throughput sequencing technologies, exome sequencing and targeted region sequencing have become routine approaches for identifying mutations of inherited disorders in both genetics research and molecular diagnosis.  while whole-genome sequencing may capture all possible mutations, whole-exome sequencing remains cost-effective and captures most phenotype-altering mutations.  exome sequencing has the capability of reliably identifying inherited and de novo single-nucleotide variants, small insertions, and deletions.  in addition to heritable germline and de novo mutations, exome sequencing has also succeeded in unravelling somatic driver mutations for a wide range of cancers through individual studies or international collaborative effort such as the cancer genome international consortium.  whole exome sequencing has become a pivotal methodology for rapid and cost-effective detection of pathogenic variations in mendelian disorders.  exome sequencing enables us to screen most of the protein coding genes in an unbiased way, this technique represents an ideal tool to identify previously under- or unappreciated phenotypes associated with known disease genes and genetic disorders.  massively parallel dna sequencing, such as exome sequencing, has become a routine clinical procedure to identify pathogenic variants responsible for a patient's phenotype.  there is an imminent need for comprehensive and easy-to-use downstream analysis tools to isolate causal mutations in exome sequencing studies.  on top of research discoveries, the application of exome sequencing as a diagnostic tool is also increasingly evident.  this tool will greatly facilitate the downstream analysis of exome sequencing data and can play a useful role for researchers and clinicians in identifying causal mutations of inherited disorders.  we conclude that combination of mutation detection methods with dna sequencing enhances the efficiency of identifying pathogenic mutations.  exome sequencing has proven to be an effective tool to discover the genetic basis of mendelian disorders.  detection of these mutations by dna sequencing can be made more efficient by using mutation detection methods for pre-screening to identify the affected exon and to screen for the presence of already identified mutations in family members.  next-generation sequencing and exome-capture technologies are currently revolutionizing the way geneticists screen for disease-causing mutations in rare mendelian disorders. ||| ",Yes
Is pesticide exposure associated with polyneuropathy?,Yes,"The association between polyneuropathy and occupational exposure to pesticides, including trichloroethylene, trichloroethane, perchloroethylene, and similar solvents, is a topic of ongoing debate. While peripheral neuropathy is the most common neurological syndrome produced by industrial and agricultural chemicals, the specific relationship between pesticide exposure and polyneuropathy remains unclear. Chronic sequelae of acute pesticide poisoning from organophosphate compounds include a variety of neurological symptoms, but the data on dose-effect relations and the development of polyneuropathy are limited. Therefore, it is currently controversial to definitively state that pesticide exposure is associated with polyneuropathy.","neurological characteristics were assessed to determine their relationship with previously reported pesticide-related illnesses.  increasing toxicologic and epidemiologic evidence suggests that pesticides and other environmental exposures are associated with idiopathic parkinson's disease.  association of parkinson's disease and its subtypes with agricultural pesticide exposures in men: a case-control study in france.  epidemiological evidence suggests that pesticides and other environmental exposures may have a role in the etiology of idiopathic parkinson's disease (pd).  the purpose of this study is to evaluate the association between pesticides and neurological symptoms among a population exposed to organophosphate chemicals as a result of agricultural use.  for more than two decades, reports have suggested that pesticides and herbicides may be an etiologic factor in idiopathic parkinson's disease (pd).  epidemiological studies have reported an increased risk of parkinson's disease (pd) in farmers exposed to pesticides, but no clear conclusion can be drawn on the type of pesticide and duration of use associated with an effect.  increasing epidemiological and toxicological evidence suggests that pesticides and other environmental exposures may be associated with the development of parkinson's disease (pd).  exposure to pesticides may be a risk factor for developing parkinson's disease (pd).  chronic, low-dose exposure to pesticides is suspected to increase the risk for parkinson's disease (pd), but data are inconclusive.  individuals who have had an acute pesticide poisoning have been reported to suffer a wide range of neurological symptoms that occur from weeks to months after the initial episode.  previous research has indicated that occupational exposure to pesticides and possibly airborne endotoxin may increase the risk of developing parkinson disease (pd).  there is a general consensus that pesticides are involved in the aetiology of parkinson's disease (pd), although associations between specific pesticides and the risk of developing pd have not been well studied.  this study helps to better characterize different aspects of pesticide exposure associated with pd, and shows a significant association of pesticides with tremor-dominant pd in men, the most typical pd presentation.  an association between polyneuropathy and occupational exposure to trichloroethylene, trichloroethane, perchloroethylene, or similar solvents alone or in combination is controversial.  peripheral neuropathy is the commonest neurological syndrome produced by industrial and agricultural chemicals.  pesticides have been associated with parkinson's disease (pd), but there are few data on important exposure characteristics such as dose-effect relations.  chronic sequelae of acute pesticide poisoning from organophosphate compounds include a variety of neurological symptoms including restlessness, irritability, and trouble sleeping.  in these conditions and to a different extent, pesticides such as paraquat, maneb and other dithiocarbamates, pyrethroids, rotenone, and dieldrin cause neurotoxic effects that may suggest a possible role in the development of a pd-like syndrome in animals.  we prospectively examined whether individuals exposed to pesticides have higher risk for pd than those not exposed. ||| ",Yes
Are hepadnaviral minichromosomes free of nucleosomes?,No,".

     The results indicate that hepadnaviral minichromosomes are not free of nucleosomes. In fact, the nucleosomes along viral cccDNA in the minichromosomes are sequence-specifically positioned. The transcriptional regulatory region of the simian virus 40 minichromosome that is being transcribed in the cell is nucleosome-free, while that of the non-transcribed minichromosome is nucleosome covered. The results also show that the two types of minichromosome contain the same number of nucleosomes as well as nucleosomal structure. However, when encapsidated in virus particles, the viral DNA is devoid of any nucleosomes.","this study supplies the initial framework for the understanding of the overall complete structure of hepadnaviral cccdna minichromosomes.  these results imply that the nucleosomes along viral cccdna in the minichromosomes are not random but sequence-specifically positioned.  non-transcribed minichromosomes eluted from nuclei but transcriptionally active ones did not.  the results show that the two types of minichromosome contain the same number of nucleosomes as well as nucleosomal structure.  the transcriptional regulatory region of the simian virus 40 minichromosome that is being transcribed in the cell is nucleosome-free, while that of the non-transcribed minichromosome is nucleosome covered.  when encapsidated in virus particles, the viral dna is devoid of any nucleosomes.  hepadnaviruses are dna viruses but, as pararetroviruses, their morphogenesis initiates with the encapsidation of an rna pregenome, and these viruses have therefore evolved mechanisms to exclude nucleocapsids that contain incompletely matured genomes from participating in budding and secretion.  in contrast to cellular chromatin the nucleosomal spacing of the hbv minichromosome has been shown to be unusually reduced by approximately 10 %.  hepadnaviral covalently closed circular dna (cccdna) exists as an episomal minichromosome in the nucleus of virus-infected hepatocytes, and serves as the transcriptional template for the synthesis of viral mrnas.  to obtain insight on the structure of hepadnaviral cccdna minichromosomes, we utilized ducks infected with the duck hepatitis b virus (dhbv) as a model and determined the in vivo nucleosome distribution pattern on viral cccdna by the micrococcal nuclease (mnase) mapping and genome-wide pcr amplification of isolated mononucleosomal dhbv dna.  moreover, late viral replication compartments are also devoid of histones.  covalently closed circular dna (cccdna) of hepadnaviruses exists as an episomal minichromosome in the nucleus of an infected hepatocyte and serves as the template for the transcription of viral mrnas.  covalently closed circular dna (cccdna) of hepadnaviruses exists as an episomal minichromosome in the nucleus of infected hepatocyte and serves as the transcriptional template for viral mrna synthesis.  the viral dna lacks histones when encapsidated in the virion.  our findings, confirmed by in vivo and in vitro experiments indicate that hbv core protein is a component of the hbv minichromosome, binds preferentially to hbv double-stranded dna, and its binding results in a reduction of the nucleosomal spacing of the hbv nucleoprotein complexes by 10 %.  viral minichromosomes provide simple models for chromatin domains.  we show that hpv origin-containing plasmids partition as minichromosomes, attributable to an association of the viral origin recognition protein e2 with mitotic spindles.  however, hsv-1 genomes do not interact with histones in virions and are deposited in nuclear domains devoid of histones.  we suggest that the monomeric and oligomeric linear dnas produced by illegitimate replication may be precursors of the integrated and other high-molecular-weight hepadnaviral dna forms seen in chronic infection.  our results indicate that components of the host cell nucleosome deposition machinery target intranuclear cmv dna, resulting in stepwise viral-chromatin assembly. ||| ",No
Is there a relationship between thyroid hormone altered metabolism and coronary artery disease?,Yes,"Justification: The context provided suggests that there is a potential causal relationship between thyroid status and cardiovascular disease. Thyroid dysfunction, particularly hypothyroidism, has been associated with an increased risk of coronary artery disease. Changes in thyroid hormone concentration can negatively affect the cardiovascular system, leading to heart dysfunctions and arterial wall remodeling, which increases cardiovascular risk. Furthermore, studies have shown that thyroid hormones affect the cardiovascular system, and their association with cardiovascular conditions, such as cardiomyopathy and arrhythmias, has been well studied. However, the precise mechanisms of their effects on the development of atherosclerosis are not entirely clear. Nonetheless, the evidence suggests that there is a relationship between thyroid hormone altered metabolism and coronary artery disease.","observational studies suggest interconnections between thyroid status, metabolism, and risk of coronary artery disease (cad), but causality remains to be proven.  the present study aimed to investigate the potential causal relationship between thyroid status and cardiovascular disease and to characterize the metabolomic profile associated with thyroid status.  considerable evidence suggests that thyroid dysfunction, especially hypothyroidism, may lead to coronary artery disease (cad).  changes in thyroid hormone concentration can negatively affect the cardiovascular system.  thyroid dysfunction, both hypo- and hyperthyroidism, has been associated with cardiovascular disease.  thyroid dysfunction may affect the risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality through effects on myocardial and vascular tissue and metabolism.  heart dysfunctions have been shown to be associated with altered concentrations of thyroid hormones.  overt thyroid dysfunction, hypothyroidism in particular, may lead to coronary artery disease (cad).  the association between thyroid hormones and cardiovascular conditions has been well studied, specifically, the effects of hypothyroidism on cardiomyopathy, and hyperthyroidism with arrhythmias.  thyroid hormones affect the cardiovascular system, but the precise mechanisms of their effects on the development of atherosclerosis are not entirely clear.  most studies have concluded that thyroid dysfunction is associated with arterial wall remodeling and, thus, with increased cardiovascular risk.  because an unfavorable lipid profile would provide a possible explanation for the reported association of coronary-heart disease with this syndrome, we have evaluated the relationship of thyrotropin (tsh) with total cholesterol, low-density-lipoprotein (ldl) cholesterol, and triglycerides in patients with normal thyroid function (n = 4886) as well as subclinical (n = 1055) and manifest (n = 92) hypothyroidism.  abnormalities of thyroid function are associated with changes in lipid concentrations and in the incidence of ischaemic heart disease.  we planned this study to investigate whether serum free thyroxine (ft4) or thyroid-stimulating hormone (tsh) levels are associated with coronary artery calcification measured in healthy euthyroid subjects.  it is unclear whether thyroid hormone levels within the normal range are also associated with atherosclerosis measured by coronary artery calcium (cac).  the current study aimed to evaluate the relationship between thyroid function using thyroid-stimulating hormone (tsh) and free thyroxine (ft4) and cardiometabolic risk factors and the clustering of these risk factors (metabolic syndrome) in euthyroid children and adolescents.  to assess whether thyroid hormones may predict carotid atherosclerosis, we performed multivariate regression analyses, and we showed that, in both populations of hypothyroid and euthyroid patients, neither the tsh values nor the ft4 concentrations were independent risk factors for carotid atherosclerosis.  overt hypothyroidism is associated with an increased prevalence of cardiovascular heart disease (chd).  hypothyroidism is associated with an increased risk of coronary artery disease, beyond that which can be explained by its association with conventional cardiovascular risk factors.  to investigate the association of thyroid hormone levels with the risk of developing atherosclerosis in euthyroid t2d patients in central china. ||| ",Yes

Is Pfh1 a component of the replisome?,Yes,"Pfh1, a member of the Pif1 helicases, has been shown to play a crucial role in the maintenance of both nuclear and mitochondrial genomes in Schizosaccharomyces pombe. The protein promotes semi-conservative replication through telomeric DNA, and its effects on telomere replication and length are likely direct, as evidenced by its high telomere binding in cells expressing endogenous levels of Pfh1. Furthermore, Pfh1 has been implicated in DNA synthesis across hard-to-replicate sites and in lagging-strand synthesis with polymerase δ (polδ). These findings suggest that Pfh1 is a component of the replisome, as it is involved in DNA replication and is required for the maintenance of genome integrity.","pfh1, the sole member of the pif1 helicases in schizosaccharomyces pombe, is multifunctional and essential for maintenance of both the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes.  pfh1, the sole schizosaccharomyces pombe pif1 family dna helicase, is essential for maintenance of both nuclear and mitochondrial dnas.  these findings argue that pfh1 is a positive regulator of telomere length and telomere replication.  we show that the 76 c-terminal residues are responsible for targeting pfhp1 to the nucleus.  our results uncover a novel function of pif1 and provide insights into the mechanism of hr.  these results suggest p1 repa is structurally homologous to plasmid initiators, including those of f, r6k, psc101, pcu1, pps10, pfa3, pgsh500, rts1, rephi1b, repfib, and rsf1010.  it is unclear how rev1 is recruited to replication foci in cells.  pfh1 promoted semi-conservative replication through telomeric dna, as replication forks moved more slowly through telomeres when pfh1 levels were reduced.  the effects of pfh1 on telomere replication and telomere length are likely direct as pfh1 exhibited high telomere binding in cells expressing endogenous levels of pfh1.  however, we lack mechanistic insights into the functions of pfh1 and its different motifs.  in contrast, here we show that, instead of depending on rep, pf replication depends on uvrd, an accessory helicase implicated in dna repair.  in addition, npfh1 displaced proteins from dna and possessed strand-annealing activity.  recombinant pf1-cys-prx protein (rpf1-cys-prx) competed with glutathione (gsh) for fp and inhibited fp degradation by gsh.  we have assessed the properties of an open reading frame pfprex (formerly known as pom1) and confirm that it specifies a multi-domain polypeptide with dna primase, dna helicase, dna polymerase and 3'-5' exonuclease activities.  pif1 has a role in dna synthesis across hard-to-replicate sites and in lagging-strand synthesis with polymerase δ (polδ).  pf replicates by a rolling circle replication system which depends on a phage-encoded initiator protein and host factors usually involved in chromosome replication.  here we show that the nuclear isoform of pfh1 (npfh1) unwound rna/dna hybrids more efficiently than dna/dna, suggesting that pfh1 resolves rna/dna structures like r-loops in vivo.  rep, an accessory replicative dna helicase, is crucial for replication of filamentous phages in escherichia coli.  pfhp1 is essential for parasite proliferation and the heritable silencing of genes linked to antigenic variation, host cell invasion, and sexual conversion.  furthermore, we reveal that each of the three functional domains of pfhp1 are required for heterochromatin formation, gene silencing, and mitotic parasite proliferation. ||| ",No
Does triiodothyronine stimulate red blood cell sodium potassium pump?,Yes,"Triiodothyronine (T3) has been shown to regulate the activity of the sodium-potassium ATPase (Na+/K+-ATPase) in a variety of mammalian target tissues, including the myocardium. The Na+/K+-ATPase is the enzymatic equivalent of the sodium pump, which is responsible for maintaining the electrochemical gradient of sodium and potassium ions across the cell membrane. The activity of the Na+/K+-ATPase is regulated by thyroid hormone in responsive tissues, and T3 has been shown to increase the Vmax for ATP, Na+, and K+ of ventricular microsomal Na-K-ATPase in hypothyroid rats. Furthermore, T3 has been shown to increase Na-K-ATPase activity, sodium-dependent oxygen consumption, and para-aminohippurate accumulation by kidney slices in euthyroid rats. Therefore, it can be inferred that T3 stimulates the red blood cell sodium potassium pump.","triiodothyronine pretreatment enhanced beta-adrenergic responses in both the control and the stunned myocytes.  tsh (seems to) affects the human erythrocytes na(+)/k(+)-atpase in vitro, however receptors on erythrocytes have not yet been described.  to investigate whether triiodothyronine pretreatment enhanced beta-adrenergic responses in stunned myocardium and whether this acute effect of triiodothyronine was mediated through the cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (amp) system.  to assess the possible role of the na+ pump in mediating physiological responses to thyroid hormone in the rat myocardium, we examined the effects of l-3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (t3) on the activities of the closely associated enzymes, na+-k+-dependent adenosine triphosphatase (na-k-atpase) and k+-dependent p-nitrophenyl phosphatase (k-dep-pnppase).  the possibility that augmentation of cardiac na+-k+-dependent adenosine triphosphatase (na-k-atpase) by l-3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (t3) was mediated by early changes in intracellular ion concentrations (1, 1) was explored by time-course analysis after a single injection of t3 in thyroid-ablated (131i) rats.  injection of t3 of the hypothyroid rat, however, significantly increased the vmax's for atp, na+, and k+ of ventricular microsomal na-k-atpase.  the purpose of this study was to determine whether triiodothyronine (t3) regulates the level of the messenger rna (mrna) coding for na,k-atpase alpha- and beta-subunits in the heart.  in conclusion the tsh action on na(+)/k(+)-atpase of human erythrocytes can be explained by the presence of tshr.  triiodothyronine (5 minutes) alone significantly increased the percent shortening in the control (from 3.75 +/- 0.36 to 4.34 +/- 0.45) and in the stunned myocytes (from 2.91 +/- 0.2 to 3.85 +/- 0.26).  after triiodothyronine pretreatment, isoproterenol caused a small increase in the cyclic amp level in the control but not in the stunned myocytes.  triiodothyronine (10 nmol/l) and/or isoproterenol (0.1 nmol/l) was added to the myocytes.  hypothyroid rats administered triiodothyronine (10 migrogram b.i.d.)  triiodothyronine pretreatment did not cause any change in cyclic amp levels in the control (2.50 +/- 0.29) or in the stunned myocytes (2.60 +/- 0.40).  however, this acute positive inotropic effect of triiodothyronine might not be mediated through the cyclic amp system.  thyroid hormone 3,3',5-triiodothyronine (t3) is an important regulator of na(+)-k(+)-adenosinetriphosphatase (na(+)-k(+)-atpase) activity in a variety of mammalian target tissues.  3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (t3) has a stimulatory effect on cellular growth via thyroid hormone receptors (trs) in several cell lines.  treatment of euthyroid rats with 3,5,3'-triiodo-1-thyronine increased na-k-atpase activity, sodium-dependent oxygen consumption (qo2), and para-aminohippurate (pah) accumulation by kidney slices without changing glomerular filtration rate or net sodium reabsorption by the intact kidney.  synthesis and activity of the enzymatic equivalent of the sodium pump, na,k-atpase, are regulated by thyroid hormone in responsive tissues.  after triiodothyronine pretreatment for 5 minutes, isoproterenol caused greater increases in the percent shortening in both the control (37%) and the stunned myocytes (62%) than either agent alone.  administration of t3 to hypothyroid rats had no effect on the transition temperature or the activation energy of ventricular microsomal na-k-atpase, as analyzed by an arrhenius plot. ||| ",No
Could RG7112 be used as cancer therapy?,No,"The context does not provide information on the use of RG7112 as a cancer therapy. The context discusses various other compounds and their potential use in cancer treatment, such as r11, ro-07-0582, mkt-077, compound-7g, gr63178a, azd7762, and ra-700. However, there is no mention of RG7112. Therefore, it is not possible to determine if RG7112 could be used as a cancer therapy based on the provided context.","r11 has been studied both as a cancer prevention agent, as well as, a cancer chemotherapeutic agent.  ro-07-0582 has thus been shown to have a radiosensitising effect in man and may therefore prove of value in radiotherapy.  a rhodacyanine dye called mkt-077 has shown a highly selective toxicity toward several distinct human malignant cell lines, including bladder carcinoma ej, and has been subjected to clinical trials for cancer therapy.  in the present study, compound-7g exhibited strong activity in suppressing proliferation and growth of glioblastoma cells.  gr63178a (nsc d611615) is the second pentacyclic pyrolloquinone to be evaluated clinically as an anticancer drug.  we have previously shown that compound-7g inhibits colorectal cancer cell proliferation and survival by inducing cell cycle arrest and pi3k/akt/mtor pathway blockage.  the clinical application of azd7762 as an adjuvant in the chemotherapy of osteosarcoma should be further explored.  thus, our preclinical results imply that wye-687 may have important translational value for the treatment of rcc.  knockdown of srp72 resulted in significant radiosensitization of hela (cervical), psn-1 (pancreatic), and t24 (bladder), bt-549 (breast) and mcf7 (breast) tumor lines as measured by colony formation assays.  r11 alone and in combination with other agents can be used for the treatment of cervical dysplasia or leukemia.  taxol is active against a number of cancers, some of which are also radiosensitive.  ra-700 inhibited lewis tumor growth in the early stage after tumor implantation, whereas deoxy-bouvardin and vcr did not.  azd7762 is a checkpoint kinase 1 (chk 1) inhibitor, which has been reported to sensitize many tumor cells to dna damage.  this suggests the potential application of rhtrail in the treatment of adenomas with high-grade dysplasia.  srp72 depletion also resulted in the radiosensitization of normal lung fibroblast cell lines (hfl1 and mrc-5), demonstrating that the effect is not restricted to tumor cells.  these results suggest that azd7762 could effectively promote cisplatin-induced apoptosis and mitotic catastrophe in osteosarcoma cells.  the antitumor activity of ra-700, a cyclic hexapeptide isolated from rubia cordifolia, was evaluated in comparison with deoxy-bouvardin and vincristine (vcr).  the aim of this study was to investigate whether it is possible to induce apoptosis in human adenoma cell lines and human adenomas using rhtrail.  in the present study, we demonstrated that azd7762 could enhance cisplatin-mediated apoptosis and mitotic catastrophe of osteosarcoma cells in vitro, and promote the inhibition of xenograft growth induced by cisplatin in vivo.  the farnesyl transferase inhibitor r115777 has been found to have clinical activity in diverse hematopoietic tumors. ||| ",Yes
Are pseudogenes enriched with housekeeping protein families?,No,"The provided context does not explicitly state that pseudogenes are enriched with housekeeping protein families. Instead, it focuses on the growing recognition of pseudogenes as important resources in understanding the evolutionary history of genes and genomes. The context mentions that pseudogenes, once thought to be purely nonfunctional gene fossils, are now known to play important biological roles. However, it does not provide information on the specific protein families associated with pseudogenes, let alone their enrichment with housekeeping protein families. Therefore, based on the given context, it is not possible to confirm that pseudogenes are enriched with housekeeping protein families.","pseudogenes, the nonfunctional homologues of functional genes are now coming to light as important resources regarding the study of human protein evolution.  the human genes configuring pseudogenes are also now coming forth as important resources in the study of human protein evolution.  although often presumed to lack function, growing numbers of pseudogenes are being found to play important biological roles.  pseudogenes are commonly encountered during investigation of the genomes of a wide range of life forms.  in this study, focusing on human pseudogenes and their functional homologues we describe their characteristic features and relevance to protein sequence evolution.  pseudogenes, regarded as 'genomic fossils', are dna sequences resembling functional genes in perspective of sequence homology but completely non-functional.  pseudogenes are important resources in understanding the evolutionary history of genes and genomes.  although pseudogenes were reported to exist in the genomes of many eukaryotes and bacteria, no systematic search for pseudogenes in the escherichia coli genome has been carried out.  pseudogenes.  during the last few years, the study of pseudogenes has excited enthusiasm, because it has been proven that at least some of them are involved in important biological processes.  we suggest that pseudogenes constitute a small fraction of the genomes of free-living bacteria in general, reflecting the faster elimination than production of pseudogenes.  researches on the progenitors of human processed pseudogenes delved out their highly expressed and evolutionarily conserved characters.  in this study, we characterized human processed pseudogenes in terms of evolutionary dynamics.  in consideration of their evolutionary origins and inherent limitations in genome annotation practices, we posit that pseudogenes have been classified on a scientifically unsubstantiated basis.  pseudogenes are abundant in the human genome and had long been thought of purely as nonfunctional gene fossils.  the discovery that pseudogenes are involved in important biological processes has excited enthusiasm and increased the research interest on them.  our results indicate that the generation of processed pseudogenes was not wholly futile but instead has been an indispensable resource, driving dynamic evolution of the mammalian genomes.  this review concentrates on vertebrate, and in particular mammalian, pseudogenes and describes their origin and subsequent evolution.  despite the wide distribution of processed pseudogenes in mammalian genomes, such as those of human and mouse, relatively little is known about their roles in genomic evolution.  recently, whole-genome computational approaches have revealed thousands of pseudogenes in the genomes of the human and other eukaryotes. ||| ",Yes
Does armodafinil improve fatigue of glioma patients?,No,"The results of a randomized clinical trial found no meaningful benefit of using treatment with armodafinil to reduce cancer-related fatigue in patients with high-grade glioma (HGG). Despite the fact that armodafinil is a wakefulness-promoting medication and has been hypothesized to reduce fatigue and sleepiness in patients receiving brain radiotherapy, an 8-week course of armodafinil did not improve fatigue or quality of life in glioma patients undergoing radiotherapy in a pilot study. Further studies are needed to determine whether pharmacologic treatment improves fatigue in glioma patients undergoing radiotherapy.","we evaluated whether armodafinil, a wakefulness-promoting medication, improves fatigue in glioma patients undergoing rt.  we investigated whether armodafinil could reduce cancer-related fatigue in mm patients.  while treatment was well-tolerated, an 8-week course of armodafinil did not improve fatigue or qol in glioma patients undergoing rt in this pilot study.  we hypothesized that armodafinil (a wakefulness-promoting drug known to reduce fatigue and increase cognitive function in breast cancer patients receiving chemotherapy) would result in reduced fatigue and sleepiness for patients receiving brain rt.  armodafinil is a psychostimulant that might help cancer-related fatigue in patients with hgg.  further studies are needed to determine whether pharmacologic treatment improves fatigue in glioma patients undergoing rt.  armodafinil is a drug known to promote wakefulness, which is related to modafinil, a compound that improves fatigue in some cancer patients treated with chemotherapeutic agents.  to determine whether armodafinil reduces fatigue in patients with hgg and moderate-to-severe fatigue.  this study examined whether alleviation of fatigue with armodafinil in a placebo-controlled double-blind 4-week trial had an effect on cognitive function among those with and without mild neuropsychological impairment at baseline.  fatigue is common among glioma patients undergoing radiotherapy (rt) and impacts quality of life (qol).  this double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial evaluated the efficacy of armodafinil in mm patients with evidence of moderate fatigue.  these preliminary results suggest a therapeutic effect of armodafinil on fatigue affecting quality of life during menopause, and a potential benefit for other menopause-related symptoms.  in this randomized multicenter, phase 3, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial, adults with hgg and moderate-to-severe fatigue who were clinically stable at least 4 weeks after completing radiation therapy were randomized to receive armodafinil daily (150 mg or 250 mg) or placebo over 8 weeks.  the results of this randomized clinical trial found no meaningful benefit of using treatment with armodafinil to reduce cancer-related fatigue in patients with hgg.  a phase ii, multi-institutional, placebo-controlled randomized trial assessed feasibility of armodafinil 150 mg/day in participants receiving brain rt, from whom we obtained estimates of variability for fatigue, sleepiness, qol, cognitive function, and treatment effect.  nearly 96% of patients with high-grade glioma (hgg) report moderate-to-severe fatigue.  fatigue is a well-known effect of antiangiogenic therapies (aats) of cancer.  armodafinil 150 mg/day was well tolerated in primary brain tumor patients undergoing rt with good compliance.  armodafinil did not reduce depressive symptoms in the absence of improved energy, but of those patients with an axis i depressive disorder at study entry whose energy improved, 82% experienced improved mood as well.  women (aged 40-65 y) experiencing menopause-related fatigue received open-label armodafinil therapy (up to 150 mg/d) for 4 weeks. ||| ",No
Has intepirdine been evaluated in clinical trials? (November 2017),No,"The provided context discusses the clinical trials and efficacy of various integrase stand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs) for the management of HIV-1. These INSTIs include raltegravir, elvitegravir, and dolutegravir. The review examines the role of these drugs in increasing viral suppression and maintaining undetectability with fewer side-effects. The context also mentions the ongoing phase II trial of carbotegravir, a long-acting INSTI. However, there is no mention of intepirdine or any clinical trials related to it in the provided context. Therefore, based on the given information, it can be concluded that intepirdine has not been evaluated in clinical trials as of November 2017.","this review of recent published literature and data presented at scientific meetings on integrase stand transfer inhibitors (instis) examines how these findings may impact on their future clinical use.  hiv-1 integrase (in) is the molecular target of the newly approved anti-aids drug raltegravir (mk-0518, isentress) while elvitegravir (gs-9137, jtk-303) is in clinical trials.  to evaluate the efficacy and safety/tolerability of dolutegravir (dtg, s/gsk1349572), a potent inhibitor of hiv integrase, through the full 96 weeks of the spring-1 study.  instis have gained a leading role in the management of hiv-1 because of increased viral suppression and maintaining undetectability with fewer side-effects.ral 1200 mg once-daily (qd) has been shown to be noninferior to 400 mg bd, and the european medicines agency has approved qd ral for review.  the iss t-002 trial was conducted in 11 clinical centers in italy on 168 hiv positive subjects under highly active antiretroviral therapy (haart), anti-tat antibody (ab) negative at baseline, with plasma viremia <50 copies/ml in the last 6 months prior to enrollment, and cd4(+) t-cell number ≥200 cells/μl.  clinical trials of the first approved integrase inhibitor (ini), raltegravir, have demonstrated a drop in the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1) rna loads of infected patients that was unexpectedly more rapid than that with a potent reverse transcriptase inhibitor, and apparently dose independent.  the safety and clinical impact of isoprinosine in hiv-infected individuals were assessed in a multicentre, randomized, double-blind, 24-week study phase, followed by an optional 24-week open treatment phase.  ing112276 (spring-1) was a 96-week, randomized, partially blinded, phase iib dose-ranging study.  our findings demonstrate that both raltegravir and elvitegravir are potent in inhibitors and are highly selective for the st reaction of in.  the ongoing phase iib power 1 (tmc114-c213) trial is designed to assess efficacy and safety of the protease inhibitor (pi) tmc114 (darunavir) in treatment-experienced hiv-1-infected patients.  this randomized, partially blinded, 24-week dose-finding study compared efficacy and safety of four doses of tmc114 plus low-dose ritonavir (tmc114/r) with investigator-selected control pi(s) (cpi).  to date, there have been no reports investigating the potential for differential effects on viral dynamics with integrase inhibitors relative to current antiretroviral drugs.  gsk1265744 is an hiv integrase strand transfer inhibitor selected for clinical development.  there are some emerging reports of neuropsychiatric and gastrointestinal side-effects associated with dtg, which were not reported in clinical trials emphasizing the importance of real-life data.carbotegravir, a long-acting insti, is currently in the pipeline of development.  the phase ii multicenter, randomized, open label, therapeutic trial (iss t-002, clinicaltrials.gov nct00751595) was aimed at evaluating the immunogenicity and the safety of the biologically active hiv-1 tat protein administered at 7.5 or 30 μg, given 3 or 5 times monthly, and at exploring immunological and virological disease biomarkers.  they also indicate the promise of this new integrase inhibitor raltegravir.  this first-time-in-human and phase iia investigation assessed gsk1265744 antiviral activity, pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerability in healthy and hiv-1-infected subjects.  elvitegravir (evg), raltegravir (ral) and dolutegravir (dtg) are instis recommended as first-line options for treatment naive patients by the european aids clinical society, british hiv association, international aids society-usa and dhhs.  raltegravir (mk-0518) belongs to the new class of hiv integrase inhibitors.  bictegravir (bic)/emtricitabine (ftc)/tenofovir alafenamide (taf) was food and drug administration approved in february 2018. ||| ",Yes
