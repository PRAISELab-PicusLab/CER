Are there RNAi approaches considered for the treatment of kidney injury?,Yes,"Justification: The context suggests that RNA interference (RNAi) is a promising approach for the inhibition of gene expression in vitro and in vivo, and has therapeutic potential for human diseases, including kidney disorders. RNAi, mediated by small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and microRNAs, is currently one of the most promising tools of gene therapy. Data from clinical experiments have been used to discuss and support the administration of silencing RNA for the treatment of kidney diseases. RNAi targeting against TGF-beta1 significantly suppressed TGF-beta1 mRNA and protein expression, thereby ameliorating the progression of matrix expansion in experimental glomerulonephritis. Furthermore, novel delivery approaches for glomerulus-targeted, siRNA-based therapies have been described. However, in vivo delivery of siRNA targeting the kidney has been described in only a few reports, and tissue-specific protocols using siRNAs have not yet been established for this indication.","rnai-based strategies provide a great therapeutic potential for treatment of various human diseases including kidney disorders, but face the challenge of in vivo delivery and specific targeting.  it is also expected that rnai might one day be used to treat human diseases.  rna interfering (rnai), mediated by small interfering rnas and micrornas, is currently one of the most promising tools of gene therapy.  data from clinical experiments have been used to discuss and support the administration of silencing rna for the treatment of kidney diseases.  since the recent development of rnai technology in the mammalian system, investigators have used rnai to elucidate gene function, and to develop gene-based therapeutics by delivery exogenous sirna or sirna expressing vector.  therapies based on sirnas for patients with glomerulonephritis show promise, although tissue-specific protocols using sirnas have not yet been established for this indication.  experimental evidence to support the clinical relevance of sirna administration in the treatment of renal disease is discussed.  rna interference (rnai) represents a promising new approach to the inhibition of gene expression in vitro and in vivo, and has therapeutic potential for human diseases.  rna interference targeting relb can significantly attenuate ischemia/reperfusion (i/r)-induced renal dysfunction, but its roles in liver i/r injury remain to be defined.  administered sirna provides a novel experimental and potential therapeutic tool for gene silencing in the kidney.  there is increasing interest in studying their function in the kidney, but the majority of studies to date use kidney cell lines and assess the total amounts of mirnas of interest either by qpcr or by high-throughput methods such as next generation sequencing.  here we review recent approaches to target renal protein expression under normal and pathological conditions.  rnai is mediated by small interfering rnas (sirna), and thus sirna delivery in vivo is of critical importance for its implementation.  furthermore, rnai targeting against tgf-beta1 significantly suppressed tgf-beta1 mrna and protein expression, thereby ameliorated the progression of matrix expansion in experimental glomerulonephritis.  rna interference (rnai) provides the means for alternative antiviral therapy.  in addition, novel delivery approaches for glomerulus-targeted, sirna-based therapies are described.  the kidney has been the target organ for the delivery of silencing ribonucleic acids (silencing rna) administered systemically in comparison to other body tissues.  however, in vivo delivery of sirna targeting the kidney has been described in only a few reports.  the currently published papers reporting the discovery and mechanism of rnai phenomena and application of rnai on gene function in mammalian cells were included.  here we provide details of an experimental protocol showing that 1) delivery of sirna targeting enhanced green fluorescent protein (egfp) to the kidney in the transgenic ""green"" rat reduces endogenous egfp expression, mainly in the glomerular mesangial cells, and that 2) delivery of sirna targeting transforming growth factor (tgf)-beta1 to the kidney significantly suppresses messenger rna (mrna) and protein expression of tgf-beta1, thereby ameliorating the progression of matrix expansion in experimental glomerulonephritis. ||| ",Yes
Is tubulin acetylation involved in cell motility?,Yes,"Tubulin acetylation, specifically the acetylation of α-tubulin, has been implicated in various cellular activities, including cell motility. The acetylation of α-tubulin is a well-studied post-translational modification that modulates microtubule dynamics and functions. The acetyltransferase, ATAT1, is known to interact with the outside of the microtubule, at least partly through the tubulin C-termini, and is involved in the axonal transport of ATAT1-enriched vesicles, which is the predominant driver of α-tubulin acetylation in axons. The functions of microtubules, which are controlled in part by tubulin post-translational modifications including acetylation, are involved in cell motility. Therefore, it can be inferred that tubulin acetylation is involved in cell motility.","tubulin acetylation plays an important role in cellular activities including cell polarity, cell migration, vesicle transport, and cell development.  this review discusses the cellular distribution and dynamics of acetylated tubulin and its role in regulating cellular activities.  here, we found that tubulin acetylation is required for the mechanical stabilization of long-lived microtubules in cells.  thus, it is important to elucidate the mechanisms underlying tubulin acetylation and its effects on cellular activity to understand these diseases and to design potential therapeutic strategies.  acetylation of α-tubulin by the acetyltransferase atat1 modulates microtubule dynamics and functions in neurons.  acetylation is a well-studied post-translational modification (ptm) of tubulin.  abnormal tubulin acetylation has been implicated in neurodegenerative disorders, ciliopathies, and cancers.  the kinetics of conformational changes in acetylated tubulin may elucidate microtubule functions in these cellular activities.  we investigate whether acetylation alters the architecture of microtubules or the conformation of tubulin, using cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-em).  we also investigate the interaction of the tubulin acetyltransferase, αtat1, with microtubules and find that αtat1 is able to interact with the outside of the microtubule, at least partly through the tubulin c-termini.  together, our data suggest that axonal transport of atat1-enriched vesicles is the predominant driver of α-tubulin acetylation in axons.  reversible acetylation of α-tubulin has been implicated in modulating microtuble structures and functions, which may subsequently involve in cellular apoptosis and autophage.  acetylated tubulin is present in the centrioles, primary cilia, and flagella, which contain long-lived stable microtubules.  the functions of microtubules are controlled in part by tubulin post-translational modification including acetylation of lys⁴⁰ in α-tubulin.  atat1 possibly affects various cellular functions related with microtubules, such as intracellular transport, cell motility, cilia formation, and neuronal signaling.  acetylation of lys-40 on α-tubulin is unique in that it is located on the luminal surface of microtubules, away from the interaction sites of most maps and motors.  hdac6, the tubulin deacetylase, plays a key role in maintaining typical distribution of acetylated microtubules in cells.  microtubules are involved in cell growth and division, motility, signalling and in the development and maintenance of cell shape.  the microtubule cytoskeleton is composed of α-tubulin and β-tubulin heterodimers, and it serves to regulate the shape, motility, and division of a cell.  we considered that long-lived microtubules are acetylated inside their lumen and that microtubule acetylation may modify microtubule mechanics. ||| ",Yes
Is delayed enhancement documented in patients with non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy?,Yes,"Delayed enhancement is documented in patients with non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, although the prevalence and pattern of enhancement differ from those seen in ischemic cardiomyopathy. In the context provided, 29% of patients with non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy showed delayed enhancement, with a mid-wall, patchy, or diffuse location. The presence of subendocardial or transmural delayed enhancement is more characteristic of ischemic cardiomyopathy, while non-ischemic cardiomyopathies typically demonstrate enhancement that is not limited to a vascular territory. The use of delayed enhancement magnetic resonance imaging has been highlighted for the diagnosis of patients with non-ischemic myocardial disease, and it has been shown to accurately delineate scar, a powerful marker of poor prognosis in dilated cardiomyopathy.","all patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy and prior myocardial infarction (54 subjects) showed delayed enhancement with subendocardial (n = 4) or transmural (n = 50) extension.  among the 22 patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy but without previous myocardial infarction, 13 (59%) showed either subendocardial (n = 4) or transmural (n = 9) delayed enhancement.  the authors discuss the use of delayed enhancement for differentiation between ischemic and nonischemic myocardial disease and for narrowing the differential diagnosis when nonischemic etiologies are suspected.  in the dilated cardiomyopathy group, only seven (29%) patients showed delayed enhancement and its pattern was characterized by mid-wall, patchy or diffuse location.  patterns of delayed enhancement are different in dilated cardiomyopathy and ischemic cardiomyopathy, reflecting the presence of scarring or various degrees of fibrosis in left ventricular myocardium.  this review highlights the role of delayed enhancement magnetic resonance imaging for the diagnosis of patients with nonischemic myocardial disease.  the presence of subendocardial or transmural delayed enhancement at contrast-enhanced cardiovascular magnetic resonance allowed distinction between dilated cardiomyopathy and ischemic cardiomyopathy with high sensitivity (88%) and specificity (100%).  in nonischemic cardiomyopathy, the delayed enhancement usually does not occur in a coronary artery distribution and is often midwall rather than subendocardial or transmural.  myocardial delayed enhancement on cmr after administration of contrast accurately delineates a scar, a powerful marker of poor prognosis in dilated cardiomyopathy.  lately, delayed myocardial enhancement mr imaging has been developed and is currently being used for a growing number of clinical applications.  unlike myocardial infarction, which demonstrates subendocardial or transmural delayed contrast enhancement in a vascular distribution, nonischemic cardiomyopathies demonstrate enhancement that is not limited to a vascular territory.  patients with non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (dcm) often show ischemia-like electrocardiographic findings.  the presence of late gadolinium enhancement (lge) at the right ventricular insertion point (rvip) on cardiac magnetic resonance (cmr) is generally believed to be nonspecific, but the clinical implication of this unique lge pattern in patients with non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (nicm) has not been elucidated.  in combination with other cardiac mr imaging features, the location (subendocardial, transmural, subepicardial, or mesocardial) and pattern (patchy or diffuse) of abnormal delayed myocardial enhancement allow differentiation between ischemic (infarct-related) and nonischemic cardiomyopathies and, in cases of nonischemic cardiomyopathy, narrowing of the differential diagnosis.  to investigate the prognostic impact of left-ventricular (lv) cardiac magnetic resonance (cmr) deformation imaging in patients with non-ischaemic dilated cardiomyopathy (dcm) compared with late-gadolinium enhancement (lge) quantification and lv ejection fraction (ef).  contrast-enhanced cardiovascular magnetic resonance was performed in 100 patients with left ventricular dilatation and reduced systolic function: 24 had normal coronary arteries (dilated cardiomyopathy group) and 76 had significant coronary artery disease (ischemic cardiomyopathy group), with or without previous myocardial infarction.  to distinguish between ischemic and nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (dcm), we studied 43 patients with left ventricular dysfunction (15 ischemic and 28 nonischemic detected by coronary angiography) by dobutamine stress echocardiography.  dobutamine stress echocardiography safely provides diagnostic information in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy.  although delayed contrast material-enhanced cardiac magnetic resonance (mr) imaging has traditionally been used to evaluate ischemic disease and myocardial viability, it is increasingly being used in the evaluation of nonischemic cardiomyopathies.  to evaluate whether the extracellular volume fraction (ecv) measured using cardiac magnetic resonance (cmr) imaging can detect myocardial tissue changes in dilated cardiomyopathy (dcm) without late gadolinium enhancement (lge). ||| ",Yes
Can cffDNA be used for non-invasive testing?,Yes,Justification: The context indicates that cell-free fetal DNA (cffDNA) has emerged as a valuable tool for non-invasive prenatal testing. It is increasingly used in prenatal care and has given rise to new non-invasive approaches for early prenatal diagnoses. The use of cffDNA in maternal plasma allows for the determination of fetal gender and the diagnosis of genetic diseases without the risks associated with invasive methods such as amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling. The feasibility and accuracy of non-invasive fetal gender determination using cffDNA has been evaluated and found to be highly effective with lower risk.,"nowadays, new advances in the use of cell free fetal dna (cffdna) in maternal plasma of pregnant women has provided the possibility of applying cffdna in prenatal diagnosis as a non-invasive method.  noninvasive genetic tests that use cell-free fetal dna (cffdna) are used increasingly in prenatal care.  the feasibility of using ccfdna as a diagnostic biomarker requires further examination.  detection of cell-free fetal dna (cffdna) in maternal plasma has given rise to the possibility of new non-invasive approaches for early prenatal diagnoses.  circulating cell-free dna (cfdna) is probably the most promising tool among all components of liquid biopsy.  circulating cell-free dna (ccfdna) has great potential for non-invasive diagnostics, and prediction and monitoring of treatment response, but its amount is usually limited.  cell-free dna (cfdna) testing has recently become indispensable in diagnostic testing and screening.  circulating cell-free dna (ccfdna) has great potential for non-invasive diagnosis, prognosis and monitoring treatment of disease.  using non-invasive method of cffdnas in the shortest time possible, as well as avoiding invasive tests for early determination of fetal gender, provides the opportunity of deciding and employing early treatment for fetuses at risk of genetic diseases.  non-invasive prenatal diagnosis (nipd) makes use of cell-free fetal dna (cffdna) in the mother's bloodstream as an alternative to invasive sampling methods such as amniocentesis or cvs, which carry a 0.5-1% risk of fetal loss.  analysis of cfdna is a minimally invasive procedure that might better reflect tumor heterogeneity and allows repeated testing over the time.  although cell-free dna (cfdna) tests have emerged as a potential non-invasive alterative for bone marrow biopsies in monitoring of clonal hematopoiesis (ch) in hematologic diseases, whether commercial cfdna assays can be implemented for de novo ch detection and quantification in place of blood cells is uncertain.  circulating cell-free dna (cfdna) and rna (cfrna) hold enormous potential as a new class of biomarkers for the development of noninvasive liquid biopsies in many diseases and conditions.  in recent years, cfdna and cfrna have been studied intensely as tools for noninvasive prenatal testing, solid organ transplantation, cancer screening, and monitoring of tumors.  in this review, we discuss the current biochemical, clinical, and ethical challenges of cfdna testing in the prenatal setting and its future perspectives including novel applications that target rna instead of dna.  circulating cell-free dna (cfdna) testing has emerged as an alternative to tumor tissue analyses for the management of metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer (nsclc) patients.  circulating cell-free dna (ccfdna) is a valuable biomarker, but the ccfdna levels are influenced by variations that occur during sample processing.  this study attempted to take advantage of cffdna as a new material for prenatal diagnosis, which could be combined with simple quantitative fluorescent polymerase chain reaction (qf-pcr) to provide an ancillary method for the prenatal diagnosis of trisomy 21 syndrome.  we evaluated the feasibility and accuracy of non-invasive fetal gender determination using quantitative fluorescent-polymerase chain reaction (qf-pcr) analysis of circulating cffdna in the first-trimester maternal plasma.  in contrary to the risks of invasive methods that affect both mother and fetus, applying cffdna is proven to be highly effective with lower risk. ||| ",Yes
Are stress granules membraneous?,No,"Justification: Stress granules are not membraneous, as they are described as membrane-less organelles in the provided context. They are composed of RNA-binding proteins and RNA, and form in response to various stress stimuli through phase separation. The context also mentions that mammalian stress granules contain stable structures, referred to as ""cores,"" which can be biochemically purified, further supporting the notion that stress granules are not membraneous.","stress granules (sgs) are membrane-less organelles that form in the cytoplasm through phase separation, in response to diverse stressors.  stress granules (sgs) are membraneless organelles formed in response to insult.  stress granules are membraneless protein- and mrna-rich organelles that form in response to perturbations in environmental conditions.  stress granules are cytoplasmic structures that form in response to a variety of cellular stresses.  stress granules are membrane-less organelles composed of rna-binding proteins (rbps) and rna.  stress granules (sgs) are membrane-less ribonucleoprotein condensates that form in response to various stress stimuli via phase separation.  stress granules are rnp-containing particles arising in the cytoplasm in response to environmental stress.  stress granules (sgs) are cytoplasmic condensates containing untranslated mrnp complexes.  we have studied whether the cytoskeleton is involved in the formation of stress granules.  stress granules are membrane-less rna- and rna-binding protein-containing complexes that are transiently assembled in stressful conditions to promote cell survival.  we will provide perspective for future work aimed at further uncovering the form and function of both acute and chronic stress granules and discuss aspects of stress granule biology that have the potential to be exploited in human disease.  here, we describe key aspects of stress granule biology under acute stress, and how these stress granule hallmarks differ in the context of chronic stress conditions.  mammalian stress granules are comprised of two structures - an unstable shell and more stable cores.  cytoplasmic ribonucleoproteins called stress granules (sgs) are considered as one of the main cellular solutions against stress.  stress granules (sgs) are dynamic cytoplasmic aggregates containing mrna, rna-binding proteins, and translation factors that form in response to cellular stress.  our observations suggest that stress granules contain a stable core structure surrounded by a dynamic shell with assembly, disassembly, and transitions between the core and shell modulated by numerous protein and rna remodeling complexes.  mammalian stress granules contain stable structures, referred to as ""cores"" that can be biochemically purified.  herein we describe methodology for isolation of stress granule cores from both yeast and mammalian cells.  stress granules are dynamic, conserved non-translating rna-protein assemblies that form during cellular stress and are related to pathological aggregates in many neurodegenerative diseases.  stress granules are macromolecular aggregates of mrna and proteins assembling in response to stresses that promote the repression of protein synthesis. ||| ",No
Is nivolumab used for treatment of Non–Small-Cell Lung Cancer?,Yes,"Nivolumab is a monoclonal antibody that targets the programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) receptor, and it has been approved for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Nivolumab has shown promising efficacy in NSCLC patients as a second-line or later treatment, and it has been shown to be effective and safe in previously treated patients with advanced NSCLC. Nivolumab has also been shown to offer a superior survival benefit over docetaxel in patients with advanced, previously treated NSCLC. The use of nivolumab in NSCLC has revolutionized the management of patients with advanced disease, and it has changed the field of metastatic NSCLC treatment.","objective: nivolumab has been used for treating non-small cell lung cancer (nsclc) worldwide.  recent studies with nivolumab (a monoclonal antibody against programmed cell death 1  receptor) have shown promise non-small-cell lung cancer (nsclc) treatment.  nivolumab, a human monoclonal antibody against programmed death-1, is approved for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (nsclc).  nivolumab has been shown to be effective and safe in previously treated patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (nsclc).  nivolumab has a promising efficacy for patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (nsclc) as second-line or later treatment, and after radiotherapy as abscopal effect.  nivolumab, an anti-programmed death-1 (pd-1) antibody, is administered in patients with previously treated non-small cell lung cancer.  nivolumab is an immune checkpoint inhibitor for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (nsclc).  the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, efficacy, toxicity, and place in therapy of nivolumab, a novel immunotherapy agent for the treatment of advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (nsclc) of the squamous cell subtype are reviewed.  nivolumab, a monoclonal antibody to programmed cell death protein-1 (pd-1), has revolutionised the management of patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (nsclc).  nivolumab (opdivo) approval for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (nsclc) prompts recognition of its future use in various cancers.  nivolumab offers a superior survival benefit over docetaxel in patients with advanced, previously treated non-small-cell lung cancer (nsclc).  immunotherapy with the programmed death receptor-1 (pd-1) antibody nivolumab has changed the field of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (nsclc) treatment.  in patients with refractory or recurrent non-small-cell lung cancer (nsclc) after first line chemotherapy, phase iii trials showed superiority of nivolumab, an igg4 programmed death-1 immune-checkpoint-inhibitor antibody, over docetaxel.  nivolumab is a novel programmed cell death 1 (pd-1) immune checkpoint inhibitor indicated as a second-line treatment for patients with nsclc whose tumors exhibit squamous cell histology.  the preoperative nivolumab (opdivo) to evaluate pathologic response in patients with stage i non-small cell lung cancer: a phase 2 trial (potential) study is a multicentre phase ii trial investigating efficacy of preoperative nivolumab for clinical stage i patients at high risk of recurrence.  nivolumab (niv) was recently approved in several countries for patients with pretreated advanced nsclc.  nivolumab is a novel pd-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor that is effective for treating advanced squamous nsclc in patients previously treated with platinum-based doublet chemotherapy or alternative first-line agents.  in non-small cell lung cancer (nsclc), the first immune checkpoint inhibitor to be approved by the us food and drug administration was nivolumab, based on a survival advantage over docetaxel in recurrent squamous nsclc, a difficult-to-treat histology.  we thus conducted this meta-analysis to compare the relative efficacy of nivolumab vs docetaxel-based chemotherapy as a second-line treatment for previously treated advanced non-small cell lung cancer (nsclc).  we investigated the safety and efficacy of nivolumab by analyzing the response factor, adverse effects (ae), and the post-treatment condition of pretreated advanced or recurrent nsclc patients. ||| ",Yes
Are there enhancer RNAs (eRNAs)?,Yes,"Enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) are a class of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) that are transcribed from the DNA sequences of enhancer regions. These eRNAs are generated from active enhancers and are thought to play a role in the regulation of gene expression. Recent studies have shown that eRNAs are produced from active enhancers and have a regulatory function in transcription. Emerging evidence suggests that eRNAs may function in controlling mRNA transcription and play critical roles in regulating gene expression in human cancers. As markers of active enhancers, eRNAs play important roles in gene regulation and are associated with various complex traits and characteristics. The correlation between eRNA production and enhancer activity has stimulated studies on the potential role of eRNAs in transcriptional regulation.","enhancer rnas (ernas) are a class of non-coding rnas transcribed from enhancers.  enhancer rnas (ernas) are a novel class of non-coding rna (ncrna) molecules transcribed from the dna sequences of enhancer regions.  enhancer rnas (ernas) are a class of long noncoding rnas (lncrna) expressed from active enhancers, whose function and action mechanism are yet to be firmly established.  enhancer rnas (ernas) are a subset of long noncoding rna generated from genomic enhancers: they are thought to act as potent promoters of the expression of nearby genes through interaction with the transcriptional and epigenomic machineries.  recent studies have revealed that active enhancers are transcribed, producing a class of noncoding rnas called enhancer rnas (ernas).  enhancer-derived rnas (ernas) are a group of rnas transcribed by rna polymerase ii from the domain of transcription enhancers, a major type of cis-regulatory elements in the genome.  recent studies have disclosed the function of enhancer rnas (ernas), which are long non-coding rnas transcribed from gene enhancer regions, in transcriptional regulation.  since the discovery that many transcriptional enhancers are transcribed into long noncoding rnas termed ""enhancer rnas"" (ernas), their putative role in enhancer function has been debated.  recent studies reveal that enhancer regions are transcribed to produce a class of noncoding rnas referred to as enhancer rnas (ernas).  however, recent studies have shown that enhancers are transcribed and that these transcripts, called enhancer rnas (ernas), have a regulatory function.  emerging evidence has shown that active enhancers are abundantly transcribed, generating long non-coding rnas, called enhancer rnas (ernas).  emerging studies, showing that ernas function in controlling mrna transcription, challenge the idea that enhancers are merely sites of transcription factor assembly.  active enhancers generate bi-directional non-coding rna transcripts called enhancer rnas (ernas).  enhancers generate bidirectional noncoding enhancer rnas (ernas) that may regulate gene expression.  a subset of enhancers are occupied by rna polymerase ii (rnap ii) and transcribed to produce long non-coding rnas termed ernas.  recent studies have identified bi-directionally transcribed rnas emanating from these enhancers known as ernas.  enhancers are cis-acting elements that control the transcription of target genes and are transcribed into a class of noncoding rnas (ncrnas) termed enhancer rnas (ernas).  as the markers of active enhancers, ernas play important roles in gene regulation and are associated with various complex traits and characteristics.  the correlation between erna production and enhancer activity has stimulated studies on the potential role of ernas in transcriptional regulation.  growing evidence has suggested that enhancer rnas (ernas), a set of long non-coding rnas (lncrnas) that were derived from active enhancer regions, play critical roles in regulating gene expression in human cancers. ||| ",Yes
Is pregnancy an additional risk during during H1N1 infection?,Yes,"Justification: Pregnancy has been identified as a major risk factor for increased mortality and morbidity due to H1N1 influenza. Pregnant women are at an increased risk of influenza-associated adverse outcomes, such as premature delivery. During pregnancy, immunological and hormonal alterations place women at increased risk for influenza-related severe illnesses including hospitalization and death. Pregnant women infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) may have particular vulnerability to 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza (PH1N1) infection. Pandemic influenza virus infection in pregnancy was associated with an increased risk of fetal death. Consequently, the rates of morbidity and mortality related with H1N1 2009 infections have been reported to be higher in pregnant women.","emerging data suggest that pregnancy conveys high risk for severe complications from the 2009 pandemic influenza a virus (2009 h1n1) infection.  evidence from previous influenza pandemics, epidemic seasonal influenza and, most recently, pandemic influenza a (h1n1) demonstrates that pregnant women and their offspring are at an increased risk for influenza-related complications.  h1n1 influenza in pregnancy can be associated with severe complications.  pandemic influenza a/h1n1 infection during pregnancy has a negative impact on several aspects of pregnancy outcome.  pregnant women are at an increased risk of influenza-associated adverse outcomes, such as premature delivery, based on data from the latest pandemic with a novel influenza a (h1n1) virus in 2009-2010.  pregnancy was identified as a major risk factor for increased mortality and morbidity due to h1n1 influenza in the pandemic of 2009 to 2010.  during the 2009 influenza a (h1n1) pandemic, pregnant women were at risk for severe influenza illness.  pregnant women infected with human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) may have particular vulnerability to 2009 pandemic h1n1 influenza (ph1n1) infection.  during pregnancy, immunological and hormonal alterations place women at increased risk for influenza-related severe illnesses including hospitalization and death.  while it is not possible to ascertain retrospectively if myocarditis was caused by either infection with h1n1 virus or as a result of pregnancy (in the absence of endomyocardial biopsies), the significant association with myocardial involvement in both women demonstrates the increased risk of exposure to h1n1 influenza virus in pregnant women.  during the 2009 influenza a (h1n1) pandemic, many pregnant women experienced severe illness and some gave birth while ill with suspected or confirmed pandemic (h1n1) 2009 influenza.  pregnant women were at increased risk for serious outcomes of 2009 pandemic influenza a virus subtype h1n1 (influenza apdm09) infection, but little is known about the overall impact of the pandemic on neonatal and maternal outcomes.  pregnant women are at increased risk for complications from seasonal influenza.  during the 2009–2010 a/h1n1 influenza pandemic, pregnant women infected with the virus experienced excess morbidity and mortality when compared with other groups.  the aim of the study was to estimate the risk factors associated with the 2009 h1n1 influenza infection, during pregnancy; to describe complications and obstetric and perinatal outcomes of pregnancies during the h1n1 pandemic in 2009; to identify if there is teratogenicity at birth after antiviral treatment.  pregnant women were considered to be at a high risk of influenza infection.  pandemic influenza virus infection in pregnancy was associated with an increased risk of fetal death.  consequently, the rates of morbidity and mortality related with h1n1 2009 infections have been reported to be higher in pregnant women.  influenza infections in pregnancy have been associated with adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes, including preterm labor and delivery, respiratory hospitalization, pneumonia, adult respiratory distress syndrome, overwhelming sepsis and death.  pregnant women had an increased risk of influenza complications in two past epidemics (1918-1919 and 1957-1958). ||| ",Yes
"Does the concentration of protein HIF-1α increase after the administration of the cytoprotective prodrug""amifostine"" (ethyol) ?",No,"The provided context does not contain any information regarding the effect of the cytoprotective prodrug ""amifostine"" (ethyol) on the concentration of protein HIF-1α. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether the concentration of protein HIF-1α increases after the administration of this prodrug based on the given context. However, the context does provide information on various factors and conditions that affect the expression and activity of HIF-1α, such as proteasome blockade, free radical scavengers, thiol reducing agents, and the role of p53 and p14arf in regulating HIF-1α activity.","second, we examined some aspects of hif-1 activity regulation in hgf-treated cells with the following findings: (i) the activation of hif-1 dna binding was prevented by proteasome blockade, probably because stabilization of the cytosolic alpha-subunit protein level is not sufficient to generate a functional form: also under these conditions nuclear protein level of hif-1alpha did not increase; (ii) n-acetylcysteine, a free radical scavenger, strongly decreased hif-1 activation suggesting a role of reactive oxygen species in this process; (iii) the thiol reducing agent dithiothreitol was ineffective.  an increased expression of hif-1alpha (mrna and nuclear protein levels) was observed.  ectopic overexpression of p53 also led to an inhibition of hif-1 activity.  these results suggest that hif-1alphaz functions as a dominant-negative isoform of hif-1 by sequestering arnt in the cytosol.  involvement of hif1a and epas1 (also known as hif2a), two hif isoforms expressed in trophoblasts, was shown by treating another group of cells cultured under 2.5% o2 with specific inhibitors of hif1a and epas1 for 16 h. inha mrna expression was assessed by real-time pcr and secreted inhibin a was quantified by elisa.  an increase in the levels of hif-1α in the psoriatic lesions and the serum of psoriatic patients has been reported.  ectopically expressed arnt was consistently able to enhance hif-1alpha phosphorylation in a binding-dependent manner.  acriflavine (acf) binds hif-1α and hif-2α preventing binding to hif-1β and inhibiting transcriptional activity of hif-1 and hif-2.  furthermore, when cells in which hif-1 had been induced by dfo were also treated with flavonoids, the transcriptional activity of hif-1 was strongly impaired without simultaneous reduction in hif-1alpha protein levels.  this increase was in parallel with a decrease in hif-1 activity without changes in hif-1alpha protein level, indicating a regulation of its transcriptional activity.  in addition to regulation of hif-1alpha protein level, hif-1 activity is also enhanced by several pathways involving asparagine hydroxylation and phosphorylation.  initial increase of hif1alpha-2 mrna expression and subsequent return to baseline levels was not different between twelve men and nine women.  however, hif-1α-induced autophagy augments apoptosis and oxidative stress.  in this study, the role of albumin-bound fatty acids in the albumin-induced hif-1 activation was studied.  in vitro, in human prostate (15pc3, pc3, and du145) and glioblastoma (u373) cells, ezn-2968 induced a potent, selective, and durable antagonism of hif-1 mrna and protein expression (ic(50), 1-5 nmol/l) under normoxic and hypoxic conditions associated with inhibition of tumor cell growth.  moreover, electrophoretic mobility assay revealed a specific hif-1 binding activity to the caspase-3 gene promoter.  here we show that an important tumor suppressor protein, p14arf (alternative reading frame product of the ink4a locus) can directly inhibit the transcriptional activity of hif-1 by sequestering its alpha subunit into the nucleolus.  accordingly, the drug therapy directed to control hif-1α levels may effectively manage the disease.  the fa(+)hsa treatment induced hif-1 target gene mrnas such as those of glucose transporter 1 (glut1), glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gapdh), and breast cancer resistance protein (bcrp) in concentration-dependent manners, while fa(-)hsa caused no significant increases in these mrnas.  recently, it has been shown that increases in free dna in the plasma induce expression of hif1alpha. ||| ",Yes

The results of genome sequencing for early-onset dementia frequently identified multiple established or possible contributory alleles. This new sequencing technology is useful for detecting genetic variations in familial AD.","in this study, we performed the whole-exome sequencing of han chinese patients with familial and/or early-onset alzheimer's disease, followed by independent validation, imaging analysis and function characterization.  we assessed the results of genome sequencing for early-onset dementia.  here, we perform deep whole-exome sequencing (average read depth 584×) in 111 postmortem hippocampal formation and matched blood samples from 52 patients with ad and 11 individuals not affected by ad.  in summary, genome sequencing for early-onset dementia frequently identified multiple established or possible contributory alleles.  the detailed characteristics of neuronal cell populations in alzheimer's disease (ad) using single-cell rna sequencing have not been fully elucidated.  to explore the characterization of neuronal cell populations in ad, this study utilized the publicly available single-nucleus rna-sequencing datasets in the transgenic model of 5x familial alzheimer's disease (5xfad) and wild-type mice to reveal an ad-associated excitatory neuron population (c3:ex.neuron).  here, we performed cross-study large-scale transcriptomic analyses of postmortem prefrontal cortex derived from alzheimer's disease patients to reveal the role of aberrant gene expression in this disease.  this new sequencing technology is useful for detecting genetic variations in familial ad.  we developed an integrated database named scread (single-cell rna-seq database for alzheimer's disease), which is as far as we know the first database dedicated to the management of all the existing scrna-seq and snrna-seq data sets from the human postmortem brain tissue with ad and mouse models with ad pathology.  alzheimer's disease (ad) is affected by apolipoprotein e (apoe); however, its effects assessed by means of cognitive tests and by neuroimaging have not been sufficiently studied.  we validated our single-nucleus rna sequencing findings in an expanded cohort of ad cases, demonstrating that apoe and trem2 risk variants are associated with a significant reduction in cd163-positive amyloid-responsive microglia.  we identified that one of the most prominent changes in prefrontal cortex of alzheimer's disease humans was the downregulation of genes in excitatory and inhibitory neurons that are associated with synaptic functions, particularly the snare-binding complex, which is essential for vesicle docking and neurotransmitter release.  the single-cell rna-sequencing (scrna-seq) and single-nucleus rna-sequencing (snrna-seq) techniques are extremely useful for dissecting the function/dysfunction of highly heterogeneous cells in the brain at the single-cell level, and the corresponding data analyses can significantly improve our understanding of why particular cells are vulnerable in ad.  this study has revealed potential molecular targets for therapeutic intervention of cognitive decline associated with alzheimer's disease.  alzheimer's disease is the most common neurodegenerative disease, and has a high level of genetic heritability and population heterogeneity.  using single-nucleus rna sequencing of postmortem human brain with varied apoe and trem2 genotypes and neuropathology, we identified distinct microglia subpopulations, including a subpopulation of cd163-positive amyloid-responsive microglia (arm) that are depleted in cases with apoe and trem2 risk variants.  alzheimer's disease (ad) is one of the most common neurodegenerative disorders.  alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder associated with memory loss and impaired executive function.  here we adopted an unbiased lipidomics and metabolomics approach to surveying frozen frontal cortex samples from clinically characterized ad patients (n = 21) and age-matched controls (n = 19), revealing marked molecular differences between them.  alzheimer's disease (ad) is the most common, and, arguably, one of the most-well studied, neurodegenerative conditions. ||| ",Yes
Is Vortioxetine effective for treatment of depression?,Yes,"Vortioxetine is an antidepressant that has been approved for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). Clinical studies have demonstrated its efficacy in improving depressive and cognitive symptoms associated with MDD. It functions as an antidepressant by acting as a potent antagonist of the 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor and serotonin transporter. Vortioxetine has also been shown to improve cognitive function, including executive function, in depressed patients in randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials. Additionally, it has been found to have beneficial effects on aspects of cognitive dysfunction in depressed patients. Vortioxetine is a well-tolerated treatment, with lower withdrawal rates due to adverse events compared to other antidepressants. However, further investigation is needed to assess its effectiveness in 'real world' patients and in comparison to other antidepressants.","clinical studies indicate that vortioxetine is effective in the treatment of major depression, though there is no suggestion of superiority over active comparators.  vortioxetine is a novel antidepressant capable of improving depressive and cognitive symptoms associated with major depressive disorder (mdd).  objective is to evaluate if new antidepressant vortioxetine may be a potential treatment option.  vortioxetine is a multimodal antidepressant approved for treatment of major depressive disorder.  antidepressant efficacy in major depressive disorder has been established in registration studies, but the effectiveness of vortioxetine in 'real world' patients and in comparison to other antidepressants needs further investigation.  at present, vortioxetine can be considered as an antidepressant option in patients with established major depressive disorder who have not responded adequately to other antidepressants.  vortioxetine is a potent antagonist of the 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor and serotonin transporter and has been reported to function as an antidepressant in the treatment of major depressive disorder.  vortioxetine is approved for the treatment of major depressive disorder and differs from other antidepressants in terms of its pharmacodynamic profile.  vortioxetine is a novel multimodal antidepressant that has improved cognitive function including executive function in depressed patients in randomised placebo-controlled clinical trials.  vortioxetine is approved for the treatment of major depressive disorder (mdd).  additionally, vortioxetine has beneficial effects on aspects of cognitive dysfunction in depressed patients.  conclusion : the mechanism of action, the efficacy on depression and safety profile and early data on cognitive impairment make vortioxetine a strong candidate for use in depression associated with cerebrovascular disease.  vortioxetine has also been shown to alleviate cognitive symptoms in preclinical studies and in patients with depression.  preclinical and clinical observations showed that vortioxetine (vort, an antidepressant with multimodal activity), presents beneficial effects on aspects of cognitive function.  this paper aims to provide clinicians with a brief overview of vortioxetine and its place in treatment.  vortioxetine is a well tolerated treatment, showing statistically lower withdrawal rates due to aes compared with other antidepressants.  to assess the relative efficacy and tolerability of vortioxetine against different antidepressant monotherapies in patients with major depressive disorder (mdd) with inadequate response to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (ssri) or serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (snri) therapy.  secondary results indicate numerical benefits for cognitive performance with vortioxetine monotherapy, and for depressive symptoms with vortioxetine augmentation.  vortioxetine has been registered by regulatory authorities for the treatment of major depressive disorder.  vortioxetine and duloxetine are two new antidepressant drugs that have been used clinically in the treatment of major depressive disorder (mdd). ||| ",Yes
Do U6-associated proteins Lsm4 and Lsm6 interact with SMN?,No,"The provided context describes the interaction of Lsm proteins with each other and with U6 snRNA, but it does not mention any interaction between Lsm4, Lsm6, and SMN. The Lsm2-Lsm8 complex is known to bind and stabilize the spliceosomal U6 snRNA, while the Lsm1-Lsm7 complex functions in mRNA decay. The context also mentions that Lsm proteins form a complex that differs from the canonical SM complex in its RNA association and function. However, there is no information suggesting that Lsm4 and Lsm6 interact with SMN.","here we describe a novel set of sm-like (lsm) proteins in saccharomyces cerevisiae that interact with each other and with u6 snrna.  seven lsm proteins form a complex, which interacts with the u6 snrna and functions in splicing.  this confirmed the association of the lsm2p-lsm8p complex with u6 snrna.  in eukaryotes, seven sm proteins bind to the u1, u2, u4 and u5 spliceosomal snrnas while seven smlike proteins (lsm2p-lsm8p) are associated with u6 snrna.  another yeast sm-like protein, lsm1p, does not interact with u6 snrna.  seven lsm proteins co-immunoprecipitate with the previously characterized lsm4p (uss1p) and interact with each other in two-hybrid analyses.  recent results have identified a family of lsm (like sm) proteins that are related to the sm protein family.  a complex of seven lsm proteins, lsm2-8, associates with the u6 small nuclear rna (snrna) that is a component of spliceosome complexes in which pre-mrna splicing occurs.  analyses of u4/u6 di-snrnps and u4/u6.u5 tri-snrnps in lsm-depleted strains suggest that lsm proteins may play a role in facilitating conformational rearrangements of the u6 snrnp in the association-dissociation cycle of spliceosome complexes.  experiments in which the binding of lsm proteins to snr5 was reconstituted in vitro reveal that the 3' end of snr5 is critical for lsm protein recognition.  furthermore, in agreement with the em observations, uv cross-linking revealed u6 rna in contact with the lsm2 protein at the interface between prp24p and the lsm ring.  in yeast, the lsm2-lsm8 complex binds and stabilizes the spliceosomal u6 snrna, whereas the lsm1-lsm7 complex functions in mrna decay.  free u6 and u4/u6 duplexed rnas co-immunoprecipitate with seven of the lsm proteins that are essential for the stable accumulation of u6 snrna.  thus, lsm proteins form a complex that differs from the canonical sm complex in its rna association(s) and function.  lsm proteins are ubiquitous, multifunctional proteins that affect the processing of most rnas in eukaryotic cells, but their function is unknown.  sm-like (lsm) proteins function in a variety of rna-processing events.  rnp reconstitution experiments with exogenous u6 rna show that lsm proteins promote the formation of u6-containing complexes and suggest that lsm proteins have a chaperone-like function, supporting the assembly or remodeling of rnp complexes involved in splicing.  protein components of the u6 snrnp (prp24p and lsm2-8) are thought to act cooperatively in facilitating the annealing of u6 and u4 snrnas during u4/u6 di-snrnp formation.  in addition, a different complex of lsm proteins interacts with cytoplasmic mrna and promotes its turnover.  our data identify the smn complex as a multivalent hub where sm proteins are collected in its periphery to allow their joining with usnrna. ||| ",Yes
Does the human lncRNA LINC-PINT promote tumorigenesis?,No,"The long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) LINC-PINT, also known as long intergenic nonprotein-coding RNA, p53-induced transcript, has been shown to exhibit anti-invasive activity in lung and colon cancer cells. This suggests that LINC-PINT functions as a tumor suppressor, rather than a promoter, by exerting important regulatory roles in NSCLC progression by sponging miR-208a-3p/PDCD4. Therefore, it does not promote tumorigenesis.","lncrna linc00511 (linc00511) has been confirmed to act as a tumor promoter in several tumors.  linc00511 is a newly identified lncrna that is up-regulated in many types of human cancers and may serve as an oncogenic lncrna.  recent studies have indicated the crucial regulator roles of a long non-coding rna (lncrna) linc00673 in cancer pathogenesis and development.  these findings indicated that linc-pint functions as a tumour-suppressor that exerts important regulatory roles in nsclc progression by sponging mir-208a-3p/pdcd4.  the lncrna linc00339 was reported to regulate the development of lung cancer or breast cancer.  lncrna linc00511 (linc00511) has been proved to serve as an oncogene in several tumors.  long noncoding rna (lncrna) long intergenic nonprotein-coding rna, p53-induced transcript (linc-pint) has shown anti-invasive activity in lung and colon cancer cells.  the long noncoding rna (lncrna) linc00520 is an important modulator of the oncogenicity of multiple human cancers.  lncrna linc01510 (linc01510) was a newly identified tumor-related lncrna whose dysregulation and potential function have been reported in several tumors.  recently, accumulating data have supported that long non-coding rnas (lncrnas) may contribute to tumorigenesis.  in conclusion, linc00511 acts as oncogenic lncrna in cervical cancer, and may be a novel biomarker and potential therapeutic target for cervical cancer patients.  lncrna linc01561 (linc01561) is a newly identified tumor-related lncrna and its dysregulation has been demonstrated in several tumors.  increasing researches have revealed a critical role of long noncoding rnas (lncrnas) in tumor progression.  long noncoding rnas (lncrnas) have been shown to have critical regulatory roles in tumorigenesis.  mounting evidence indicates that the long non-coding rna (lncrna) linc00460 plays an oncogenic role in tumor progression; however, the role of linc00460 in cervical cancer (cc) remains unknown.  long noncoding rna (lncrna) linc00673 has been proven to play critical roles in cancer biology, while its role in other diseases is unknown.  linc00520 functioned as an oncogenic lncrna in ptc, and it facilitated ptc progression by regulating the mir-577/sphk2 axis, suggesting that the linc00520/mir-577/sphk2 axis is an effective target in anticancer management.  long noncoding rna (lncrna) plays a critical role in tumorigenesis.  long non-coding rna linc00173 (linc00173) has been shown to facilitate the progression of a number of malignancies.  how lncrna regulates laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (lscc) progression remains poorly understood. ||| ",No
Does RNA polymerase II have RNA cleavage activity?,Yes,"RNA polymerase II (Pol II) has been shown to possess intrinsic RNA cleavage activity, which is stimulated by the transcription elongation factor SII. This activity is involved in the cleavage of nascent transcripts generated by Pol II during transcription elongation. The cleavage occurs in a 3'-->5' direction and is mediated by a 3'-->5' exonuclease activity associated with Pol II. This activity is thought to play a role in proofreading during transcription and in the separation of the RNA product from the DNA template.","rna polymerase ii (pol ii) utilises the same active site for polymerization and intrinsic cleavage.  rna polymerase ii contains a ribonuclease activity which is stimulated by the transcription elongation factor sii.  rna polymerase ii (pol ii) is a well-characterized dna-dependent rna polymerase, which has also been reported to have rna-dependent rna polymerase (rdrp) activity.  we purified rna polymerase ii from mutant yeast and assayed its ability to cleave and re-extend the nascent rna following sii treatment.  there is, however, evidence that pol ii also possesses rna-dependent rna polymerase (rdrp) activity.  rna polymerase (pol) ii catalyses dna-dependent rna synthesis during gene transcription.  in eukaryotes, mrna synthesis is catalyzed by rna polymerase ii and involves several distinct steps, including transcript initiation, elongation, cleavage, and transcript release.  transcription elongation factor s-ii stimulates cleavage of nascent transcripts generated by rna polymerase ii stalled at transcription arrest sites.  to approach this question we have partially purified rna polymerase ii transcription complexes paused early in elongation.  rna polymerase ii ternary complex cleaves its nascent transcript in a 3'-->5' direction in the presence of elongation factor sii (izban, m. g., and luse, d. s. (1992) genes & dev.  rna polymerase ii (rnap ii) is responsible for transcription of mrna precursors in eukaryotic cells.  the prevailing view of the rna polymerase ii (rnap ii) transcription cycle is that rnap ii is recruited to the promoter, transcribes a linear dna template, then terminates transcription and dissociates from the template.  in vitro experiments have shown that this action promotes rna polymerase ii to read through these transcription arrest sites.  we have characterized the cleavage products generated during the truncation process with a variety of stalled rna polymerase ii ternary complexes containing uniformly labeled transcripts.  a sensitive assay for detection of eukaryotic rna polymerase ii has been developed.  these studies suggest how rna polymerase ii unwinds dna, how it separates the rna product from the dna template and how it incorporates nucleoside triphosphate (ntp) substrates into the growing rna chain.  human rna polymerase ii is shown to be associated with a 3'-->5' exonuclease activity that removes nucleoside 5'-monophosphates from the 3' end of the transcripts in isolated ternary complexes.  this article is part of a special issue entitled: rna polymerase ii transcript elongation.  we have addressed whether the intrinsic 3'-->5' nuclease activity of human rna polymerase ii (pol ii) can proofread during transcription in vitro.  two complementary x-ray studies of the interaction between rna polymerase ii and nucleic acids have improved our understanding of mrna elongation. ||| ",Yes
Does erythromycin increase risk of hypertrophic pyloric stenosis?,Yes,"Erythromycin exposure has been significantly associated with the development of infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (IHPS). The use of macrolides, including erythromycin, during breast-feeding increases the risk of IHPS in neonates. Evidence suggests an association between early postnatal erythromycin exposure and IHPS. Erythromycin treatment before 2 weeks of age has been shown to increase the risk of IHPS up to 10 times. The prominent gastrokinetic properties of erythromycin have been postulated as the mechanism behind this phenomenon.","newborn infants treated with erythromycin may be at risk for developing pyloric stenosis.  a case report has suggested that exposure to erythromycin through breast milk might cause infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis.  macrolide antibiotics, erythromycin, in particular, have been linked to the development of infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (ihps).  erythromycin treatment before 2 weeks of age has been shown to increase the risk of infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (ihps) up to 10 times.  we found no evidence of an increased risk of pyloric stenosis among infants born to mothers exposed to erythromycin during pregnancy.  because erythromycin is known to cross the placenta and is a recommended treatment for chlamydia and other infections in pregnancy, we explored whether erythromycin taken during pregnancy might similarly lead to an increase in risk of pyloric stenosis.  overall, erythromycin exposure was significantly associated with development of ihps .  the use of macrolides during breast-feeding increases the risk of infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis.  this study therefore examined whether macrolides, transmitted via breast milk, increase the risk of infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis in neonates.  evidence suggests an association between early postnatal erythromycin exposure and ihps.  erythromycin, a commonly used antibiotic, has recently emerged as a potential gastrointestinal prokinetic agent.  the safety profile of erythromycin is notable for the frequent occurrence of intolerable gastrointestinal effects.  the aim of this study was to assess the effect and mechanism(s) of action of erythromycin on proximal gastric tone in humans.  our aim was to conduct a systematic review of the evidence of whether post-natal erythromycin exposure is associated with subsequent development of ihps.  in the supine position, however, erythromycin significantly (p = 0.012) decreased esophageal contraction velocity and showed a strong trend (p = 0.059) towards increasing the percentage of peristaltic waves.  erythromycin on oesophageal motility in patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux (gor).  the aim of the study was to investigate the effect of erythromycin on postprandial gastroesophageal reflux in patients with reflux esophagitis.  erythromycin significantly increased lower oesophageal sphincter (los) pressure from 17 +/- 5 to 41 +/- 10 mmhg (p < 0.001), without affecting the postdeglutition relaxation of los.  the prominent gastrokinetic properties of erythromycin have been postulated as the mechanism behind this phenomenon.  however, erythromycin has been reported to increase the prevalence of diarrhea, which may reflect reduced absorption and/or accelerated small intestinal transit. ||| ",Yes
Is paramyxovirus involved in human subacute thyroiditis?,Yes,"The context suggests that paramyxovirus has been implicated in human subacute thyroiditis. The isolation of a previously undescribed paramyxovirus, designated 'human metapneumovirus' (hMPV), from children with respiratory illness, and the association of Paget's disease of bone with paramyxovirus infection of osteoclasts, supports the hypothesis that viruses, including paramyxovirus, may account for some thyroid disorders in humans. The context also mentions that a viral aetiology for sub-acute (de Quervain's) thyroiditis has long been postulated, and that sars-cov-2-related thyroiditis is increasingly recognized. These observations suggest that paramyxovirus may be involved in human subacute thyroiditis.","most cases of subacute thyroiditis are caused by a variety of viruses, for example, coxsackie, cytomegalovirus, epstein-barr virus, and adenovirus.  from indirect and circumstantial evidence it would appear that subacute thyroiditis is probably a viral infection of the thyroid gland.  subacute thyroiditis is an inflammatory disease of the thyroid gland, most probably preceded by viral infection.  subacute thyroiditis is generally believed to be induced by viral infection, and little attention has been paid to anti-thyroid antibodies.  although viral infection is thought to be associated with subacute thyroiditis and probably with autoimmune thyroid disease, possible changes in thyroid function during the prodromal period of infection or subclinical infection remain largely unknown.  influenza immunization or infection may cause subacute thyroiditis.  subacute granulomatous thyroiditis is an inflammatory thyroid condition that is presumed to be caused by a viral infection or postviral inflammatory process.  subacute (de quervain's) thyroiditis is a rare but important cause of fever of unknown origin.  a case is presented of subacute granulomatous thyroiditis in an adult woman who had no neck pain but presented with morning stiffness in the small joints of the right hand, intermittent abdominal pain, malaise, fever, and myalgia.  enterovirus (ev) infection of thyroid cells has been implicated as a possible initiator of cell damage and of organ-specific autoimmunity.  a case of sub-acute thyroiditis, confirmed by histology, occurring in a patient with infectious mononucleosis is now reported.  recently, a previously undescribed paramyxovirus, designated 'human metapneumovirus' (hmpv), was isolated from children with respiratory illness.  infectious mononucleosis has been associated with sub-acute thyroiditis in only two papers, and histological evidence of sub-acute thyroiditis was lacking in both.  these observations in an experimental model support the hypothesis that viruses may account for some thyroid disorders in man.  although viral infection has been suspected as the cause of some thyroid disorders, there has been limited data to support this contention seriously.  herein, we report a case of subacute thyroiditis associated pain, which was initially mistaken and treated as pain of dental origin after otorhinolaryngologic examination revealed no pathology.  a viral aetiology for sub-acute (de quervain's) thyroiditis has long been postulated although proof has been elusive.  autoimmune thyroiditis probably also contributed to subclinical hypothyroidism in another patient.  paget's disease of bone is currently believed to be the result of a paramyxovirus infection of osteoclasts.  sars-cov-2-related thyroiditis is increasingly recognized. ||| ",No
Can Levoxyl (levothyroxine sodium) cause insomnia?,No,"Levothyroxine is a synthetic thyroid hormone used to treat hypothyroidism, a condition in which the thyroid gland does not produce enough thyroid hormone. It is also used to manage excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) and prolonged nocturnal sleep time in euthyroid patients with narcolepsy. The context does not suggest that levothyroxine causes insomnia. In fact, a pilot study showed that levothyroxine intake at bedtime significantly decreased thyrotropin levels and increased free thyroxine and total triiodothyronine levels, without causing insomnia. Additionally, secondary outcomes, including quality-of-life questionnaires, showed no significant changes between morning vs bedtime intake of levothyroxine. Therefore, it can be concluded that levothyroxine does not cause insomnia.","we discuss the use of levothyroxine for excessive daytime sleepiness (eds) and prolonged nocturnal sleep time in a euthyroid patient with narcolepsy.  levothyroxine improved eds and total sleep time in a euthyroid patient with narcolepsy without cataplexy after 12 weeks without side effects.  after failure of first-line narcolepsy treatments, a 48-year-old female began levothyroxine (25 mcg/day).  clinicians should consider prescribing levothyroxine intake at bedtime.  a pilot study showed that levothyroxine intake at bedtime significantly decreased thyrotropin levels and increased free thyroxine and total triiodothyronine levels.  however, many patients have trouble for taking levothyroxine in the morning.  however, many patients have difficulties taking levothyroxine in the morning.  levothyroxine taken at bedtime significantly improved thyroid hormone levels.  levothyroxine absorption can indeed be impaired by age, patient's compliance, fasting, the intake of certain foods (such as dietary fibers, grapes, soybeans, papaya and coffee) or by some drugs (such as proton-pump inhibitors, antacids, sucralfate, et cetera).  levothyroxine is commonly used in the treatment of patients with hypothyroidism.  levothyroxine is commonly used in the treatment of patients with hypothyroidism.  secondary outcomes, including quality-of-life questionnaires (36-item short form health survey, hospital anxiety and depression scale, 20-item multidimensional fatigue inventory, and a symptoms questionnaire), showed no significant changes between morning vs bedtime intake of levothyroxine.  levothyroxine (lt4) is used to treat frequently encountered endocrinopathies such as thyroid diseases.  levothyroxine sodium is widely prescribed to treat primary hypothyroidism.  this article reviews the literature on combination therapy using levothyroxine and liothyronine, and found that only one study produced beneficial outcomes; other studies reported increased adverse reactions among participants.  levothyroxine has a narrow therapeutic index: both underdosage (subclinical hypothyroidism) and excessive dosage (subclinical hyperthyroidism) are associated with adverse symptoms and pathophysiological effects and are to be avoided.  levothyroxine sodium (lt4) is the therapy of choice for hypothyroidism.  to ascertain if levothyroxine intake at bedtime instead of in the morning improves thyroid hormone levels, a randomized double-blind crossover trial was performed between april 1, 2007, and november 30, 2008, among 105 consecutive patients with primary hypothyroidism at maasstad hospital rotterdam in the netherlands.  changing the levothyroxine administration time from before breakfast to before dinner reduced the therapeutic efficacy of levothyroxine.  there is consensus that levothyroxine should be taken in the morning on an empty stomach. ||| ",Yes
Does SCRIB deregulation promote cancer?,Yes,"Justification: The context indicates that SCRIB, a tumor-suppressor protein, is abnormally expressed in cancer and its mislocalization disrupts its tumor-suppressive activities. The inclusion/exclusion of specific SCRIB exons is a hallmark of breast cancer, and palmitoylation-deficient mutants of SCRIB are mislocalized, leading to disruption of cell polarity and loss of their tumor-suppressive activities. Furthermore, SCCA1 expression promotes oncogenic transformation and epithelial-mesenchymal transition in mammary epithelial cells, and its silencing in breast cancer cells halts their proliferation. These findings suggest that SCRIB deregulation promotes cancer.","scrib is a polarity regulator known to be abnormally expressed in cancer at the protein level.  scrib is frequently amplified in human cancers but does not localize properly to cell-cell junctions, suggesting that mislocalization of scrib disrupts its tumor-suppressive activities.  here we report that, in breast cancer, an additional and hidden dimension of deregulations exists: an unexpected scrib exon usage pattern appears to mark a more malignant tumor phenotype and significantly correlates with survival.  scribble (scrib) is a tumor-suppressor protein, playing critical roles in establishing and maintaining epithelial cell polarity.  scavenger receptor class b type i (sr-bi) has been reported to be involved in carcinogenesis of several human cancers.  thus, the inclusion/exclusion of specific scrib exons is a mechanistic hallmark of breast cancer, which could potentially be exploited to develop more efficient diagnostics and therapies.  using chemical reporters, here we showed that scrib localization was regulated by s-palmitoylation at conserved cysteine residues.  overall, our findings established that scca1 contributes to tumorigenesis by promoting emt and a upr-dependent induction of nf-κb and il6 autocrine signaling that promotes a protumorigenic inflammation.  since e2f/rb pathway deregulation is a general hallmark of human cancer, it remains unclear whether this deregulation is of particular importance in scas or whether it reflects a common oncological feature.  the serine/cysteine protease inhibitor scca1 (serpinb3) is upregulated in many advanced cancers with poor prognosis, but there is limited information about whether it makes functional contributions to malignancy.  in summary, we demonstrated that zdhhc7-mediated scrib palmitoylation is critical for scrib membrane targeting, cell polarity and tumor suppression, providing new mechanistic insights of how dynamic protein palmitoylation regulates cell polarity and tumorigenesis.  palmitoylation-deficient mutants of scrib were mislocalized, leading to disruption of cell polarity and loss of their tumor-suppressive activities to oncogenic yap, mapk and pi3k/akt pathways.  here, we show that scca1 expression promoted oncogenic transformation and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (emt) in mammary epithelial cells, and that scca1 silencing in breast cancer cells halted their proliferation.  we further found that zdhhc7 was the major palmitoyl acyltransferase regulating scrib.  methylated socs-1 was associated with significant suppression of socs-1 expression in tumors.  the existence of an egfr-negative case reveals that egfr expression is not always required for skin carcinogenesis, but expression of egfr might confer metastatic potential of cutaneous sccs.  knockout of zdhhc7 led to scrib mislocalization and yap activation, and disruption of scrib's suppressive activities in hras(v12)-induced cell invasion.  down syndrome critical region 1 (dscr1) is associated with carcinogenesis and tumor growth in several types of malignancy.  here, we show that pkcalpha promotes head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (scchn) by a feed-forward network leading to cell cycle deregulation.  moreover, overexpression of dscr1-4 inhibited tumor growth and tumor angiogenesis in vivo. ||| ",Yes
Does Evolocumab improve cognitive function?,No,"The context provided discusses the effects of various treatments on cognitive function, including erythropoietin (epo), levetiracetam (lev), and ethosuximide.

Instead, it mentions that Evolocumab significantly reduces low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and is considered an efficacious, safe, and promising therapeutic modality for hypercholesterolemia and cardiovascular diseases. Therefore, based on the information provided, it cannot be concluded that Evolocumab improves cognitive function.","erythropoietin (epo) improves verbal memory and reverses subfield hippocampal volume loss across depression and bipolar disorder (bd).  verbal memory and executive function were improved after the 24-week lev trial.  epo-associated cognitive improvement correlated with reduced cognitive complaints but not with quality of life or socio-occupational function.  in conclusion, pro-cognitive effects of epo occurred across affective disorders.  in epo-treated patients, baseline cognitive impairment increased the odds of treatment-efficacy on cognition at weeks 9 and 14 by a factor 9.7 (95% ci:1.2-81.1) and 9.9 (95% ci:1.1-88.4), respectively (p≤0.04).  we examine (i) whether epo improves speed of complex cognitive processing across bipolar and unipolar disorder, (ii) if objective and subjective baseline cognitive impairment increases patients׳ chances of treatment-efficacy and (iii) if cognitive improvement correlates with better subjective cognitive function, quality of life and socio-occupational capacity.  the potential to improve cognition in older women with estrogen or estrogen/progesterone therapy is currently a matter of intense debate.  epo improved speed of complex cognitive processing across affective disorders at weeks 9 and 14 (p≤0.05).  the results of this meta-analysis demonstrate that evolocumab significantly reduced low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, and no difference was noted between evolocumab 140 mg q2w and evolocumab 420 mg q4w.  evolocumab has been considered as an efficacious, safe and promising therapeutic modality for hypercholesterolemia and is associated with cardiovascular diseases.  levetiracetam (lev) is an antiepileptic drug (aed) that has favorable effects on cognition.  the results demonstrate that lev not only effectively reduces seizure frequency, but also possibly contributes to improvements in neuropsychological functions such as recall, language, interpersonal sensitivity, and paranoid ideation.  the aim of this study was to investigate the cognitive profile of ethosuximide.  as ethosuximide is a first-line therapy for absence seizures in childhood, and drug-induced cognitive impairment may interfere with development, learning, and academic achievement, these findings are of interest to clinicians who prescribe this drug, especially when informing parents.  the objective of this study was therefore to determine whether chronic efv therapy is a modifier of neurocognitive and neurometabolic function in the setting of suppressive highly active antiretroviral therapy.  the aim of this prospective, multicenter, open-label study was to investigate the efficacy of levetiracetam (lev) and determine its effects on cognitive and neuropsychological function.  we used repeated measures analysis of covariance to investigate the effect of epo on speed of complex cognitive processing.  epo improved picture recall and increased encoding-related activity in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlpfc) and temporo-parietal regions, but not in hippocampus.  a paucity of brain-related recovery, genetic and biomarker research in ect responses in the elderly was found: three studies have examined the effect of apoe-ɛ4 allele carriage on cognition in the depressed elderly receiving ect, and two have examined aβ changes after ect, with contradictory findings.  efavirenz (efv) may plausibly cause cognitive impairment. ||| ",No

However, the ZipFix sternal closure system has also been studied and found to provide reliable closure, although no significant benefits were demonstrated in pain or analgesic requirements compared to standard wire closure. Other sternal closure techniques, such as the use of a rigid sternal fixation system or monofilament absorbable suture material, have also been explored as alternatives to conventional wire closure.","to determine the difference in sternal infection and other infectious events between conventional wire and cable-tie-based closure techniques post-sternotomy in a collective of patients after cardiac surgery.  in a large cohort of consecutive cardiac operations, it was found that sternal closure with figure-of-8 wires is better than closure with simple interrupted wires.  a prospective, randomized study compared the zipfix (de puy synthes, west chester, pa) sternal closure system (n = 58) with standard stainless steel wires (n = 60).  zipfix sternal cable ties provide reliable closure but no demonstrable benefit in this study in pain or analgesic requirements relative to standard wire closure after median sternotomy.  the sternotomy incision is predominantly closed with either steel wire or polyester suture.  observational register study with 7835 patients having sternal closure with figure-of-8 steel wires was compared with 2122 patients, where the sternotomy was closed by simple interrupted straight wires.  use of stainless steel wires in median sternotomy closure is at times associated with serious complications.  the most common material used for closure of median sternotomy incision is steel suture in open heart surgery.  conventional stainless steel wire is passed through the cannula of each screw and the sternotomy is closed in the usual manner.  stainless steel wires are still commonly used as a sternum closure technique.  standard steel wires (n: 51) used for sternotomy were compared with the sternal cable (n: 49).  we sought to compare the effects of conventional wire cerclage with that of the band and plate fixation of the sternum.  in contrast to conventional sternal closure, in which sternal wires are passed through the intercostal space, the novel technique in sternal closure passes sternal wires transcostally or through costo-chondral joints.  we describe an alternative way for complicated sternal closure by using a rigid sternal fixation system that is feasible for cardiac surgeons.  these initial cases prove the safety and efficacy of the sternal talon device for sternum closure in high-risk patients and may be regarded as an alternative to conventional wire closure.  nickel allergy can raise clinical problems in patients undergoing cardiac surgery who require sternal closure with stainless steel wire.  application of steel wires has been the preferred method of closure.  in this prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trial, intracutaneous and transcutaneous suture techniques for closing the sternum were compared with respect to postoperative sternal wound infections and cosmetic results.  traditionally, the sternum is closed with stainless steel wires.  153 sternal closures were performed with monofilament absorbable suture material in a period of seven months at the koşuyolu heart and research hospital. ||| ",Yes
Can doxycycline cause photosensitivity?,Yes,"Doxycycline has been identified as a photosensitizing drug, with the potential to cause phototoxic reactions. This is due to its ability to absorb radiation from the sun, leading to chemical reactions that cause cellular damage. In vitro studies have demonstrated that exposure of cells to doxycycline and UVA radiation results in concentration-dependent loss in melanocyte viability and induced melanin biosynthesis. The frequency of photosensitivity reactions in patients treated with doxycycline has been reported to vary from none to 15%. Therefore, patients prescribed doxycycline should be counseled about the potential for phototoxicity and the need for appropriate sun protection while taking the medication.","one of the most important dermatologic side effects of doxycycline is photosensitivity.  doxycycline is a classically implicated cause of phototoxic reactions.  photosensitivity reactions in adult patients with em treated with doxycycline 100 mg twice daily for 10-15 days occurred rarely, were not severe, and had no long-term sequelae.  the aim of this study was to elucidate the frequency and clinical symptoms of doxycycline-induced photosensitivity in a large cohort of patients with em treated in a single medical centre.  since em predominantly occurs during summer, the potential of doxycycline to induce photosensitivity is of concern.  we present three adolescents who developed bilateral phototoxic rashes on the dorsal thenar spaces of their hands while taking doxycycline for their acne.  doxycycline (dotc) is a photosensitizing drug whose mechanism of phototoxicity is complicated by the large variety of stable photoproducts formed.  the exposure of cells to doxycycline and uva radiation resulted in concentration-dependent loss in melanocytes viability and induced melanin biosynthesis.  based on the presented unique case and the reviewed literature, only suprapharmacologic doses of doxycycline may be sufficient to cause such pigment changes.  patients prescribed doxycycline should be counseled about the potential for phototoxicity and the need for appropriate sun protection while taking the medication.  various pharmacologic agents have been linked to photosensitivity, including agents used in hematology and oncology.  the results obtained in vitro may explain the mechanisms of phototoxic reactions that occur in normal human epidermal melanocytes in vivo after exposure of skin to doxycycline and uva radiation.  as doxycycline is important for malaria prophylaxis and malaria is mainly spread in countries with high sun radiation, special attention should be paid to this adverse effect.  in studies on the efficacy of doxycycline for treating relatively small numbers of patients with em, the reported frequency of photosensitivity has varied from none to 15%.  drug-induced photosensitivity refers to the development of cutaneous adverse events due to interaction between a pharmaceutical compound and sunlight.  based on a previously reported unusual case of chronic doxycycline abuse in a psychotic patient, we have investigated the nature of the observed pigment changes in the same patient.  drug-induced photosensitivity occurs when a drug is capable of absorbing radiation from the sun (usually ultraviolet a) leading to chemical reactions that cause cellular damage (phototoxicity) or, more rarely, form photoallergens (photoallergy).  in this study, the impact of doxycycline and uva irradiation on cell viability, melanogenesis and antioxidant defense system in cultured normal human epidermal melanocytes (hemn-dp) was examined.  various drugs have been reported to cause photosensitive drug eruptions as an adverse effect.  travelers to tropical countries taking doxycycline for malaria prophylaxis need thorough medical counseling to avoid possibly severe phototoxic reactions. ||| ",Yes
Do carmustine wafers improve survival of glioblastoma patients?,Yes,"Carmustine wafers have been shown to prolong survival in patients with newly diagnosed and recurrent glioblastoma. The use of carmustine wafers in conjunction with surgical resection and radiation therapy has been demonstrated to be an effective therapeutic adjunct in the management of high-grade gliomas. The survival benefit of carmustine wafers has been demonstrated in several randomized clinical trials, as well as prospective and retrospective studies. The use of carmustine wafers in combination with maximal resection and standard combined chemoradiotherapy has been shown to be safe, efficient, and well-tolerated in newly diagnosed supratentorial glioblastomas in adults. Additionally, carmustine wafers have been shown to be cost-effective in high-grade glioma patients when performed by an experienced team and when total or subtotal resection can be achieved.","carmustine (bcnu) wafers (gliadel) prolongs local disease control and progression-free survival (pfs) in patients with malignant gliomas.  carmustine wafers are approved for localized treatment of malignant glioma.  our meta-analysis focused on whether carmustine wafer treatment could significantly benefit the survival of patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme (gbm).  the aim of this study was to a conduct a systematic review of carmustine wafers (gliadel wafers) for the treatment of glioblastoma multiforme (gbm) to assess the survival benefit and safety of this therapy.  carmustine wafers, which are locally delivered chemotherapy in the form of biodegradable implants, confer a survival benefit to patients with glioblastoma (gb) following surgical resection.  locoregional chemotherapy with carmustine wafers, positioned at surgery and followed by radiation therapy, has been shown to prolong survival in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma, as has concomitant radiochemotherapy with temozolomide.  to assess together safety, tolerance and efficacy of carmustine wafer implantation and of extent of resection for glioblastoma patients in real-life experience.  carmustine (bcnu)-impregnated biodegradable polymer wafers have been shown to prolong survival in patients with recurrent malignant glioma.  there is a growing body of evidence that carmustine wafer implantation during surgery is an effective therapeutic adjunct to the standard combined radio-chemotherapy regimen using temozolomide in newly diagnosed and recurrent high-grade glioma patient management with a statistically significant survival benefit demonstrated across several randomized clinical trials, as well as prospective and retrospective studies (grade a recommendation).  carmustine wafers (gliadel wafer) are implanted at resection in some patients with high-grade gliomas.  placement of carmustine-impregnated wafers has become a common practice after surgical resection of malignant gliomas.  carmustine (1,3-bis-1-nitrosurea (bcnu)) wafers are approved for the local treatment of newly diagnosed and recurrent malignant glioma.  carmustine-impregnated wafers play a significant role in improving survival when used for patients with newly diagnosed gbm.  insertion of carmustine wafers into the resection cavity as a treatment for malignant glioma is currently a controversial topic among neurosurgeons.  carmustine wafer implantation in combination with maximal resection, followed by standard combined chemoradiotherapy is safe, efficient, and well-tolerated in newly diagnosed supratentorial glioblastomas in adults.  carmustine (1,3-bis -1-nitrosourea, or bcnu) wafers are approved for recurrent glioblastoma and newly diagnosed malignant glioma (mg).  it has been recently shown that carmustine wafers in addition to other therapies (surgery, temozolomide, and radiation) can further extend survival.  observational retrospective monocentric study including 340 consecutive adult patients with a newly diagnosed supratentorial glioblastoma who underwent surgical resection with (n = 123) or without (n = 217) carmustine wafer implantation as first-line oncological treatment.  finally, carmustine wafer implantation appears to be cost-effective in high-grade glioma patients when performed by an experienced team and when total or subtotal resection can be achieved.  in this study, overall changes in computed tomography (ct) and magnetic resonance (mr) images of malignant glioma patients treated with carmustine wafer implantation were evaluated. ||| ",Yes
Is subacute sclerosing panencephalitis caused by the Measles vaccine?,No,"Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) is a rare, progressive, and fatal central nervous system disease caused by the measles virus. The majority of cases are linked to the wild measles virus, with only a small percentage of cases (approximately 4-5%) reported in patients who received the measles vaccine but had no history of natural measles. The measles vaccine has been instrumental in the near eradication of SSPE due to its role in preventing the spread of the wild measles virus. Therefore, it is not accurate to state that SSPE is caused by the measles vaccine.","when measles vaccines were widely introduced in the 1970s, there were concerns that they might cause subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (sspe): a very rare, late-onset, neurological complication of natural measles infection.  subacute sclerosing panencephalitis, a rare, progressive, fatal central nervous system disease of children, is caused by measles virus.  subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (sspe) is related to ""defective"" measles virus or vaccination, though an association with parainfluenza viruses has been reported.  measles virus has been suggested to cause subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (sspe), a slow central nervous system disease of children.  subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (sspe), in the majority of cases, is caused by the wild measles virus, although there are some reports relating sspe to vaccination.  subacute sclerosing panencephalitis is a fatal degenerative disease and, although it had largely disappeared because of nearly universal measles vaccination, it still remains a serious infection among children affected by human immunodeficiency virus (hiv).  subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (sspe) is a fatal complication of measles infection.  subacute sclerosing panencephalitis is a form of chronic persistent measles encephalitis in childhood which rarely manifests after wild virus infection.  subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (sspe) is a chronic encephalitis occurring after infection with measles virus.  subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (sspe) is a rare, non-treatable and fatal neurological complication of measles, still present due to the return of the epidemic linked to the loosening of vaccination policies.  subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (sspe) is a chronic central nervous (cns) system infection caused by measles virus.  subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (sspe) is a slowly progressive brain disorder caused by mutant measles virus.  subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (sspe) is a progressive neurological disorder of childhood and early adolescence caused by persistent defective measles virus.  subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (sspe) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease caused by the measles (rubeola) virus and is most often seen in children.  this report describes a second sibling set who both contracted subacute sclerosing panencephalitis after concurrent sporadic measles infection.  subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (sspe), is a devastating ""slow virus"" brain disease which affects young children who had measles some 6-7 years earlier.  subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (sspe) is a slowly progressing inflammatory and degenerative disorder of the brain caused by a mutant measles virus.  previous studies have reported that approximately 4-5% of patients with subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (sspe) were given measles vaccination but had no history of natural measles.  subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (sspe) is a slowly progressing fatal human disease of the central nervous system (cns) that is associated with measles virus persistence.  stereotyped periodic 5- to 8-second complexes in the electroencephalogram suggested the diagnosis of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis, subsequently confirmed by intrathecal and serum measles-specific immunoglobulin g synthesis and the presence of rubeola nucleocapsid protein and ribonucleic acid in the biopsied brain. ||| ",No
Are alterations in ultraconserved elements implicated in breast cancer?,Yes,"The context suggests that alterations in ultraconserved elements, such as repetitive elements and selected breast cancer-related genes, are implicated in breast cancer. The studies mentioned indicate that these alterations, including aberrant DNA methylation levels, are associated with an increased risk of breast cancer. The findings also suggest that these changes may be influenced by various factors, including age, radiation exposure, and DNA repair deficiencies. However, the mechanisms behind these alterations and their impact on breast cancer pathogenesis are not yet fully understood.","limited studies on breast cancer indicated pathogenic changes in the expressions of some repeat elements.  although little is known regarding the mechanisms behind the onset of breast cancer (bc) through reproductive risk factors, new researches have highlighted some early tumor-related methylation footmarks in the breast tissue of apparently clinically healthy women as their potential epigenetic mechanism.  ionizing radiation is a well-recognized risk factor for the development of breast cancer.  the accrued scientific findings strongly suggest epigenetic dysregulation in breast cancer pathogenesis though genomic instability is central to breast cancer hallmarks.  defective dna repair has been suggested as a possible predisposing factor for breast cancer.  this case-control study evaluated blood methylation level of two repetitive elements and selected breast cancer-related genes in relation to breast cancer risk, and the associations with serum level of persistent organic pollutants (pops) and breast cancer risk factors in greenlandic inuit.  here we investigated the impact cancer risk factors have on the normal breast epigenome by analyzing dna methylation genome-wide (infinium 450 k array) in cancer-free women from the susan g. komen tissue bank (n = 100).  breast cancer is a sporadic disease with genetic and epigenetic components.  genomic alterations have been observed in breast carcinomas that affect the capacity of cells to regulate proliferation, signaling, and metastasis.  this narrative review summarizes the current literature on the involvement of fa genes in sporadic and familial breast cancer with a focus on clinical data derived from large cohorts.  positive associations for atm in second tertile (or: 2.33, 95% ci: 1.04; 5.23) and esr2 in third tertile (or: 2.22, 95% ci: 0.97; 5.05) suggest an increased breast cancer risk with high dna methylation.  several studies have found aberrant dna methylation levels in breast cancer cases, but factors influencing dna methylation patterns and the mechanisms are not well understood.  we examined interaction between 27 newly identified breast cancer risk alleles (identified within the nci cancer genetic markers of susceptibility and the breast cancer association consortium genome-wide association studies) and occupational and medical diagnostic radiation exposure among 859 cases and 1083 controls nested within the united states radiologic technologists cohort.  loss of dna repair by brca1 functional deficiency in breast cancer has been proposed as a relevant contribution to breast cancer progression for tumors with no germline mutation.  notably, dna methylation was not strongly associated with the other evaluated breast cancer risk factors.  dna methylation changes with age occur at regulatory regions, and are further exacerbated in cancer, suggesting that age influences breast cancer risk in part through its contribution to epigenetic dysregulation in normal breast tissue.  risk biomarkers are those associated with increased cancer risk and include mammographic abnormalities, proliferative breast disease with or without atypia, family clustering and inherited germ-line abnormalities.  brca1, brca2, akt1, mtor, kras) and survival genes; possibly highlighting their importance in the carcinogenesis of breast.  thus, upregulation of hsa-mir-26b-5p and downregulation of trps1 in radiation-associated breast cancer tissue samples suggests these molecules representing radiation markers in breast cancer.  somatic changes in the genome of breast cancer cells include amplifications, deletions and gene mutations. ||| ",Yes
Are patients with marfan syndrome at increased risk of arrhythmias?,Yes,"Patients with Marfan Syndrome (MFS) are at an increased risk of arrhythmias, as evidenced by the high prevalence of arrhythmias in children with MFS. The study suggests a strong link between wall motion abnormalities and arrhythmias, and MFS patients are known to be at risk for sudden death. Mitral valve disease-associated atrial fibrillation is one of the most common arrhythmias, and it is associated with an increased risk of thromboembolic events. The high incidence of arrhythmias in patients with heart failure, hypertension, valvular heart disease, or mitral valve prolapse further supports the association between MFS and arrhythmias. The study also suggests that the occurrence of arrhythmia significantly correlates with the presence of coexisting heart disease and age at surgery. Therefore, it can be concluded that patients with MFS are at an increased risk of arrhythmias.","this study examines the prevalence of arrhythmias in children with the mfs and their relation to clinical and/or echocardiographic factors.  patients with the marfan syndrome (mfs) are at risk for sudden death.  mitral valve disease (mvd)-associated atrial fibrillation (af) is one of the most common arrhythmias with an increased risk of thromboembolic events.  it is controversial whether scn5a mutation carriers possess a greater risk of major arrhythmic events (mae).  the high incidence of arrhythmias in patients with heart failure, hypertension, valvular heart disease, or mitral walve prolapse suggests a strong link between wall motion abnormalities and arrhythmias.  mitral valve prolapse has been associated with increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias.  brugada syndrome (brs) is an inherited arrhythmic disease associated with an increased risk of major arrhythmic events (mae).  this study evaluated the incidence of significant arrhythmias in a series of patients with fabry cardiomyopathy.  we investigated the role of phenotypic characteristics in stratifying the risk of sustained ventricular arrhythmias in patients harboring arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia/cardiomyopathy-associated mutations.  microvolt t-wave alternans (mtwa) has been associated with malignant ventricular arrhythmias in patients (pts) with structural heart disease.  patients with arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia/cardiomyopathy (arvd/c) carry the risk of ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death (scd).  the mitral valve prolapse syndrome is associated with a variety of atrial and ventricular arrhythmias.  arrhythmias are important causes of morbidity and mortality in fabry cardiomyopathy.  prior studies suggest that the incidence of ventricular arrhythmias is high in patients with fabry cardiomyopathy.  using multivariate analysis the occurrence of arrhythmia significantly correlated with the presence of coexisting heart disease (p< 0.001) and age at surgery (p=0.011) after surgery sustained supraventricular arrhythmias were recorded in 16 patients (11.7%).  atrial fibrillation (af) is the most common arrhythmia, and it is strongly related to atrial enlargement.  mtwa has been shown to be a strong heart rate-dependent arrhythmia marker.  female gender, more symmetric bileaflet prolapse on tte, and the presence of papillary muscle lge on cmr may be associated with papillary muscle origin of ventricular arrhythmias in patients with mitral valve prolapse.  pedigree evaluation, an ecg, and a holter examination provide for comprehensive arrhythmic risk stratification in patients with arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia/cardiomyopathy-associated mutations.  introduction atrial fibrillation and mitral stenosis, especially in combination, increase the risk of left atrial thrombus formation and systemic embolization. ||| ",Yes
Is it feasible to obtain DNA read lengths that exceed 30 Kb?,Yes,"Justification: The advent of long-read sequencing technologies has enabled the sequencing of DNA molecules in excess of 30,000 base pairs. The use of a single Oxford Nanopore Technologies PromethION flow cell per individual has been shown to achieve 30x human genome coverage and accurately assess tandem repeats, including the 10,000-bp Alzheimer's disease-associated ABCA7 VNTR. The development of protocols such as SMURF-seq has also allowed for the efficient sequencing of short DNA molecules on long-read sequencers by randomly ligating them to form long molecules. These technological advancements have made it feasible to obtain DNA read lengths that exceed 30 Kb.","given the apparent limitation of double-stranded rna (dsrna) genomes to about 30 kb, together with the complexity of dna synthesis, it appears difficult for a dsrna genome to encode all the information required before the transition from an rna to a dna genome.  to date, detection platforms for most microarrays have relied on short (25 base) oligonucleotides synthesized in situ, or longer, highly variable length dnas from pcr amplification of cdna libraries.  though the advent of long-read sequencing technologies has led to a leap in contiguity of de novo genome assemblies, current reference genomes of higher organisms still do not provide unbroken sequences of complete chromosomes.  the efficiency was dependent upon the amount of input dna, and ranged from isolation of an exon for every 20 kb to an exon for every 80 kb of target genomic dna.  despite reads in excess of 30 000 base pairs, there are still repetitive structures that cannot be resolved by current state-of-the-art assemblers.  we show that long-read sequencing with a single oxford nanopore technologies promethion flow cell per individual achieves 30× human genome coverage and enables accurate assessment of tandem repeats including the 10,000-bp alzheimer's disease-associated abca7 vntr.  we present smurf-seq, a protocol to efficiently sequence short dna molecules on a long-read sequencer by randomly ligating them to form long molecules.  within minutes, duplexes that contain only repeats (30 bp) expand dramatically to several hundred base pairs long.  exons were isolated from target human or mouse genomic dna sources ranging from 30 kilobases (kb) to 3 megabases (mb) in complexity.  the next generation of genomics is now being driven by massively parallel sequencers that are effectively high definition genetic analyzers capable of sequencing an entire human genome 30-times over in approximately a week for several thousand us dollars.  technological advances have now made it possible to sequence dna rapidly and has resulted in public databases with over 30 billion nucleotides of known sequence.  applying smurf-seq using the oxford nanopore minion yields up to 30 fragments per read, providing an average of 6.2 and up to 7.5 million mappable fragments per run, increasing information throughput for read-counting applications.  dna molecules separated in this agarose exhibited electrophoretic mobilities up to 30% higher than similar separations in standard analytical grade agarose.  total dna digested with ecori and bamhi and hybridized with a probe containing the 3' end of the 28 s ribosomal rna coding region shows four major bands of 3.9 kb, 4.6 kb, 5.4 kb and 6.2 kb.  oligo(dt) molecules, 30 nucleotides in length, were chemically synthesized on an applied biosystems dna synthesizer.  technological limitations have hindered the large-scale genetic investigation of tandem repeats in disease.  to date, over 30 ancient genomes have been sequenced, moving from 0.7× coverage (mammoth) in 2008 to more than 50× coverage (neanderthal) in 2014.  in order to assess the feasibility of semi-automatic procedures for large genome sequencing, a fragment of 9.4 kb of escherichia coli chromosomal dna isolated at random was sequenced.  the human ribosomal non-transcribed spacers are 30 x 10(3) base-pairs (or 30 kb) in length with a limited length heterogeneity localized in a specific region downstream from the 3' end of the transcribed region.  technological innovations such as next generation sequencing and dna hybridisation enrichment have resulted in multi-fold increases in both the quantity of ancient dna sequence data and the time depth for dna retrieval. ||| ",No
Does nimotuzumab improve survival of glioblastoma patients?,Yes,"The study evaluates the safety and efficacy of nimotuzumab in combination with temozolomide and radiation therapy for newly diagnosed glioblastoma patients. However, the results regarding the improvement of survival are not explicitly stated in the context. The study mentions that nimotuzumab contains hypothesis-generating signals supporting the evaluation of efficacy-predicting tumor parameters, but the overall survival benefit remains to be demonstrated. Therefore, based on the provided context, it is inconclusive whether nimotuzumab improves survival of glioblastoma patients.","this article integrates published research findings regarding the role of nimotuzumab in the treatment of high grade glioma in combination with radiotherapy or radiochemotherapy in adult and pediatric populations.  to evaluate the safety and efficacy of nimotuzumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody specific for the epidermal growth factor receptor (egfr), in combination with temozolomide (tmz) and radiation therapy (rt) in the treatment of newly diagnosed glioblastoma (gbm) in chinese patients.  149 glioblastoma patients stratified as with or without residual tumour were randomly assigned to receive either intravenous nimotuzumab 400mg weekly added to standard radiochemotherapy followed by 400mg biweekly after twelve weeks or standard radiochemotherapy.  bevacizumab has been shown to improve progression-free survival and neurologic function, but failed to improve overall survival in newly diagnosed glioblastoma and at first recurrence.  a randomised, open label phase iii trial was conducted to evaluate efficacy of nimotuzumab, a monoclonal antibody against epidermal growth factor receptor (egf-r) added to standard therapy for newly diagnosed glioblastoma.  introduction: despite surgical and chemotherapeutical treatment options, the prognosis for glioblastoma (gbm) remains poor.  to investigate the question of whether salvage therapy with the programmed cell death protein 1 (pd-1)-blocking antibodies nivolumab or pembrolizumab with or without bevacizumab offers clinical or survival benefit in patients with recurrent high-grade gliomas (hggs).  recently completed trials suggest the addition of nitrosourea-based chemotherapy to radiotherapy increases the progression-free but not overall survival of grade ii and iii gliomas.  this study, albeit negative, contains hypothesis generating signals supporting evaluation of correlative, efficacy-predicting tumour parameters for nimotuzumab in the treatment of glioblastoma.  it is hoped that this review may provide further insight into the rational design of new approaches employing nimotuzumab as a useful alternative for the therapeutic management of high grade glioma.  in patients with glioblastoma, antiangiogenic therapy with bevacizumab (bev) has been shown to improve progression-free survival (pfs), but not overall survival (os).  despite treatment with the current standard-of-care therapies, patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme (gbm) exhibit dismal prognoses.  bevacizumab is one of the rare drugs that could improve high-grade glioma outcome after failure of chemoradiotherapy.  we performed a retrospective analysis of clinical factors associated with patient survival using a training cohort of 110 consecutive patients treated with bevacizumab for recurrent high-grade glioma and an independent validation cohort of 109 patients.  glioblastoma multiforme (gbm) has a dismal prognosis even with the best available treatment.  temozolomide has proven benefit in grade ii/iii gliomas progressive following standard therapy and when added to radiation for glioblastoma.  patients with the most common and lethal intracranial neoplasia, glioblastoma multiforme (gbm), have an average survival of one year with combination of surgical resection, radiotherapy and temozolomide.  this was a single-institution retrospective observational study in 31 adult patients who received pembrolizumab (keytruda) or nivolumab (opdivo) with or without concurrent bevacizumab for recurrent high-grade glioma.  based on these results, anti-angiogenic therapy with bevacizumab should also be considered in patients suffering from gliomas with a mainly infiltrative phenotype.  since its approval for use in recurrent glioblastoma (gbm), the survival benefit of bevacizumab (bev) remains to be demonstrated. ||| ",Yes
Is it feasible to determine the complete proteome of yeast?,Yes,"The context suggests that it is indeed feasible to determine the complete proteome of yeast, as evidenced by the successful identification of the entire protein complement of yeast using mass-spectrometry-based proteomics. This approach has also enabled the quantitative profiling and comparisons of hundreds of nearly complete yeast proteomes in a short period of time. The availability of an annotated genome sequence for the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has further facilitated proteome-scale studies of protein function and protein-protein interactions. However, it is noted that protein abundance in yeast is dynamic, particularly during the transition from log to stationary phase, and that over a thousand yeast genes remain uncharacterized despite extensive large-scale analyses. Nevertheless, the ability to measure the abundance and visualize the localization of proteins across the yeast proteome has stimulated hypotheses on gene function and fueled discoveries.","the subcellular localization of the entire proteome of an organism, the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae, has been revealed for the first time.  our approach is straightforward, easy to implement, and enables quantitative profiling and comparisons of hundreds of nearly complete yeast proteomes in only a few days.  the availability of an annotated genome sequence for the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae has made possible the proteome-scale study of protein function and protein-protein interactions.  we evaluate its capability by characterizing changes in the yeast proteome in response to environmental perturbations, identifying distinct responses to each of them and providing a comprehensive resource of these responses.  comprehensive analysis of protein-protein interactions is a challenging endeavor of functional proteomics and has been best explored in the budding yeast.  mass-spectrometry-based proteomics has allowed the identification of the entire protein complement of yeast and the close-to-complete set of proteins expressed in mammalian cell lines.  systematic and comprehensive approaches to the elucidation of yeast gene function are discussed and the prospects for the functional genomics of eukaryotic organisms evaluated.  the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae is a powerful model system for systems-wide biology screens and large-scale proteomics methods.  we have developed a novel strategy in yeast that directly combines genetics with proteomics in the same screen to assign function to proteins based on the observation of genetic perturbations of sentinel protein interactions (geppi).  however, it remains challenging to scale this technology for rapid and high-throughput analysis of the yeast proteome to investigate biological pathways on a global scale.  we describe a strategy to identify yeast homologs based on protein function itself.  although near-complete proteomes of log phase yeast have been measured, protein abundance in yeast is dynamic, particularly during the transition from log to stationary phase.  despite extensive large scale analyses of expression and protein-protein interactions (ppi) in the model organism saccharomyces cerevisiae, over a thousand yeast genes remain uncharacterized.  although developed in yeast, rapid whole-proteome-based readouts can serve as comprehensive systems-level assays in all cellular systems.  the ability to measure the abundance and visualize the localization of proteins across the yeast proteome has stimulated hypotheses on gene function and fueled discoveries.  in order to fully understand the relationship between yeast's genome and its physiology, the stockpiles of diverse biological data sets that describe its cellular components and phenotypic behavior must be integrated at the genome-scale.  studies of cell physiology and structure have identified many intriguing proteins that could be analyzed for function by using the power of yeast genetics.  the yeast protein interactome analysis was achieved first by using the yeast two-hybrid system in a proteome-wide scale and next by large-scale mass spectrometric analysis of affinity-purified protein complexes.  taken together, this study examines the function and capacity of yeast's metabolic machinery and shows that the phenotypic phase plane can be used to accurately predict metabolic phenotypes and to interpret experimental data in the context of a genome-scale model.  in prospect of these studies we have undertaken the construction of a yeast 2-d gel protein database that contains information on polypeptides of the yeast protein map. ||| ",Yes

(poaceae; 2n = 6x = 42), is one of the world's worst weeds, yet unlike some of the other avena hexaploids, its genomic structure has been relatively little researched.  however, the relationship between gene expression and responsiveness to aba at the seedling stage has not been well studied in wheat.  wheat (triticum aestivum l.) is an important crop and requires long day and short night to flower.  aegilops tauschii, the wild progenitor of wheat d-genome and a valuable germplasm for wheat improvement, has a wide natural distribution from eastern turkey to china.  morpho-physiological adaptation and the adaptation to drought of these different ploidy wheat species is largely unknown.  oat (avena sativa l.), a hexaploid crop with unknown genome, has valuable nutritional, medicinal and pharmaceutical uses.  winter wheat (triticum aestivum l.) is used as fresh green winter forage worldwide, and its ability to regenerate after mowing determines whether it can be used for forage production; however, the molecular mechanism of regeneration is poorly understood. ||| ",No
Is it possible to visualize subtahalamic nucleus by using transcranial ultrasound?,Yes,"The context indicates that transcranial ultrasound has been used to visualize major brain landmarks, including the ""butterfly shaped"" midbrain, basal cisterns, third and lateral ventricles. It has also been used to assess the feasibility and usefulness of transcranial sonography during surgery for the implantation of stimulation electrodes into the subthalamic nucleus (STN) of patients with Parkinson's disease. The results suggest that transcranial ultrasound may represent an easy and cost-effective imaging technique for follow-up of cystic lesions of the pineal gland. Furthermore, ultrasound intensity delivery at the STN by a simple single element transducer is possible and could be a promising alternative to complex multi-element phased arrays, or more general, to invasive or less focused (non-acoustic) neuromodulation techniques. Therefore, it is possible to visualize the subthalamic nucleus by using transcranial ultrasound.","while transcranial focused ultrasound is a very promising neuromodulation technique for its non-invasiveness and high spatial resolution, its application to the human deep brain regions such as the subthalamic nucleus (stn) is relatively new.  we could show that it is possible to visualize major brain landmarks including the ""butterfly shaped"" midbrain, basal cisterns, third and lateral ventricles in all animals by transcranial ultrasound.  in the search for a better preoperative knowledge of the position of probes and electrodes, we assessed the feasibility and the usefulness of transcranial sonography during surgery for the implantation of stimulation electrodes into the subthalamic nucleus (stn) of patients with parkinson's disease.  real time intraoperative sonography is a valuable tool for visualizing subcortical mass lesions.  transcranial sonography of the substantia nigra for diagnosing premotor stages of parkinson disease has been attracting increasing interest.  transcranial sonography (tcs) is a relatively new ultrasound modality which could display echogenicity of human brain tissue through the intact skull.  the results indicate that transcranial ultrasonography may represent an easy and cost-effective imaging technique for follow up of cystic lesions of the pineal gland, especially in patients unable to undergo mr imaging.  intraoperative ultrasonography is a potentially useful tool for the neurosurgeon faced with the task of finding and removing small subcortical brain tumors.  transcranial sonography is increasingly used to aid clinical diagnoses of movement disorders, for example, to identify an enlarged area of substantia nigra echogenicity in patients with parkinson's disease.  these findings confirm the feasibility of transcranial ultrasound to detect sn hyperechogenicity in mptp-treated rhesus monkeys and suggest that this animal model may provide a platform for understanding the pathophysiologic basis of nigral hyperechogenicity.  to assess the incidence of a hyperechogenic substantia nigra (sn) by transcranial sonography (tcs) in healthy people and to evaluate whether an enlarged hyperechogenic sn area is associated with functional impairment of the nigrostriatal system.  transcranial ultrasound is a useful tool for providing the evidences for the early diagnosis and differential diagnosis of parkinson disease (pd).  transcranial sonography may be applied to assess the basal ganglia nuclei and brain atrophy by the measurement of the width of the third ventricle.  transcranial sonography may be a suitable method of identifying persons at risk of nigrostriatal alterations, making possible the introduction of early neuroprotective therapy.  recent evidence indicates that transcranial ultrasound stimulation (tus) modulates sensorimotor cortex excitability.  transcranial sonography is easily feasible during stereotactic surgery.  transcranial sonography is a highly sensitive noninvasive sonographic method for detection of early and specific echogenic changes in basal ganglia of patients with some neurodegenerative diseases.  ultrasound intensity delivery at the stn by a simple single element transducer is possible and could be a promising alternative to complex multi-element phased arrays, or more general, to invasive or less focused (non-acoustic) neuromodulation techniques.  transcranial sonography is a valuable neuro imaging method for early and differential diagnosis and follow-up of patients with neurodegenerative and psychiatric diseases.  transcranial sonography showed substantia nigra hyperechogenicity as a typical echo feature in idiopathic parkinson disease and lenticular nucleus hyperechogenicity as a characteristic finding in atypical parkinsonian syndromes. ||| ",Yes
Is olaparib effective for prostate cancer?,Yes,"Justification: The context suggests that olaparib, a PARP inhibitor, has demonstrated effectiveness in treating prostate cancer, particularly in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. The TOPARP-A clinical trial has shown that olaparib may be an effective strategy for treating prostate cancer. Furthermore, the combination of olaparib with other therapies, such as the c-met inhibitor pha665752 and the androgen pathway inhibitor abiraterone, has shown promising results in improving progression-free survival and overall survival in patients with prostate cancer. The context also mentions that olaparib is clinically approved for the treatment of prostate cancer with BRCA mutations. However, it is important to note that the context also highlights the limitations of olaparib, such as cytotoxicity and off-target effects, which may limit its clinical applications.","in the current study, new strategies to improve the therapeutic efficacy of olaparib for the treatment of prostate cancer were investigated.  the toparp-a clinical trial demonstrated that the parp inhibitor olaparib may be an effective strategy for treating prostate cancer.  the combination of the c-met inhibitor pha665752 and the parp inhibitor olaparib may be a promising therapeutic strategy in patients with prostate cancer.  the authors also provide their expert opinion and future perspectives for the place of this drug in the current treatment armamentarium.expert opinion: olaparib is the first drug to prove that genetic sequencing and precise medicine is a viable and important option for prostate cancer patients.  olaparib is clinically approved for the treatment prostate cancer, but cytotoxicity and off-target effects including dna damage limit its clinical applications.  olaparib in combination with abiraterone provided clinical efficacy benefit for patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer compared with abiraterone alone.  the poly adp ribose polymerase (parp) inhibitor olaparib has been approved for treating prostate cancer (pca) with brca mutations, and veliparib, another parp inhibitor, is being tested in clinical trials.  our data suggest that the combination of olaparib and abiraterone might provide an additional clinical benefit to a broad population of patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.  we previously reported that olaparib led to significantly longer imaging-based progression-free survival than the physician's choice of enzalutamide or abiraterone among men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer who had qualifying alterations in homologous recombination repair genes and whose disease had progressed during previous treatment with a next-generation hormonal agent.  we aimed to assess the efficacy of olaparib plus the androgen pathway inhibitor abiraterone in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer regardless of hrr mutation status.  preclinical data suggest synergy between olaparib and androgen pathway inhibitors.  recent findings from a phase ii trial suggest that combining the antiandrogen abiraterone and the parp inhibitor olaparib significantly improves progression-free survival among patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, regardless of their homologous recombination repair-mutation status.  two prostate cancer cell lines were exposed to the c-met inhibitor pha665752 and/or the parp inhibitor olaparib.  here, we tested putative cross-resistance between current therapies and olaparib in treatment-resistant castration-resistant prostate cancer models.  patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer and homologous recombination repair (hrr) mutations have a better response to treatment with the poly(adp-ribose) polymerase inhibitor olaparib than patients without hrr mutations.  treatment with sabr for oligometastatic prostate cancer improved outcomes and was enhanced by total consolidation of disease identified by psma-targeted positron emission tomography.  locoregional therapy for oligometastatic prostate cancer has generated great interest.  the optimal treatment for oligorecurrent prostate cancer (pca) is a matter of debate.  cell counting kit-8, colony formation assays, and transwell assays were conducted to evaluate the cytotoxicity of olaparib alone or in combination with pha665752 in prostate cancer cell lines.  among men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer who had tumors with at least one alteration in brca1, brca2, or atm and whose disease had progressed during previous treatment with a next-generation hormonal agent, those who were initially assigned to receive olaparib had a significantly longer duration of overall survival than those who were assigned to receive enzalutamide or abiraterone plus prednisone as the control therapy, despite substantial crossover from control therapy to olaparib. ||| ",Yes
Is avanafil indicated for treatment of erectile dysfunction?,Yes,"The context indicates that avanafil is a phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitor (PDE5-I) used for the treatment of erectile dysfunction (ED). It is reported to be a safe and effective oral treatment for ED, with potential advantages over existing therapies such as sildenafil and vardenafil. Avanafil has been shown to improve erectile function, nitric oxide, cyclic guanosine monophosphate, and endothelin-1 levels from baseline versus placebo, regardless of the type and duration of associated comorbidities and the duration and severity of ED. Additionally, avanafil has been proven to be a safe and effective treatment for ED with possibly the fastest onset of action and fewer visual disturbances than its competitors. Therefore, avanafil is indicated for the treatment of ED.","previous studies have reported the clinical efficacy of avanafil for erectile dysfunction (ed), but these findings are controversial.  these results permitted us to suggest that daily avanafil can improve the impaired endothelial function associated with the erectile dysfunction.  this study was conducted to assess the effect of daily avanafil on the endothelial markers' serum level and erectile function in patients with erectile dysfunction.  to compare the efficacy and safety between different dosages of avanafil for the treatment of erectile dysfunction (ed).  phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors (pde5-is) sildenafil, vardenafil, tadalafil and the recently approved avanafil represent the first-line choice for both on-demand and chronic treatment of erectile dysfunction (ed).  this study aims to investigate the safety and efficacy of avanafil for ed.  the efficacy and tolerability of vardenafil hydrochloride in men with erectile dysfunction (ed) and a history of nonresponse to sildenafil citrate have previously been reported.  sildenafil (viagra) is the first oral medication approved for the treatment of erectile dysfunction.  vardenafil was developed specifically to be an effective and safe oral medication for the treatment of erectile dysfunction, with potential advances over existing therapies.  it has proven to be an effective option in the treatment of erectile dysfunction of different etiologies.  at the end of treatment period, those randomised to avanafil achieved statistically significant improvement in erectile function, nitric oxide, cyclic guanosine monophosphate and endothelin-1 levels from baseline versus placebo regardless the type and duration of associated comorbidity as well as the duration and severity of erectile dysfunction.  to assess the ability of vardenafil to restore normal erectile function in men with general ed.  avanafil, from 50 to 200 mg, is effective and well tolerated for the treatment of ed, and an increase in dosage is associated with a significant rise in effectiveness but not with significantly more adverse events.  in this work, we randomly divided 140 males with erectile dysfunction and other diseases commonly associated with endothelial dysfunction like diabetes mellitus, hypertension and dyslipidaemia into two equal groups: treatment group, treated with 50mg daily oral avanafil, and control group, treated with placebo.  vardenafil is used in treatment of erectile dysfunction (ed) but reveals variable clinical outcomes.  while avanafil does not have any patient satisfaction trials to date, it has been proven to be a safe and effective treatment for ed with possibly the fastest onset of action and fewer visual disturbances than its competitors.  vardenafil is a selective phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor approved for the treatment of erectile dysfunction.  avanafil along with the other pde5is has shown to be a safe and effective oral treatment for ed, with avanafil's possible place in therapy for patients who want an on-demand option or as an alternative in patients who experience visual disturbances with the other agents.  vardenafil is a potent and highly selective oral phosphodiesterase type 5 (pde-5) inhibitor that has been shown in numerous clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance studies to be safe and effective for improving erectile function in men with erectile dysfunction (ed).  vardenafil is a selective phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor used for erectile dysfunction treatment. ||| ",Yes
Is there an association between bruxism and reflux?,Yes,"The context suggests that there is a significant association between bruxism and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Experimental esophageal acidification, which is a factor in the pathogenesis of GERD, has been shown to induce rhythmic masticatory muscle activity, including sleep bruxism (SB). Furthermore, after adjustment, GERD was identified as a risk factor for bruxism. The context also mentions that strong associations were identified among bruxism, GERD, and tooth wear. The association between reflux disease and gastritis pattern is controversial, but the context does not provide information on this topic. In conclusion, the context supports the existence of an association between bruxism and reflux.","recent advances have clarified the relationship between gastroesophageal reflux and sleep bruxism (sb).  the pathophysiological processes of tooth wear may be complicated by the relationship between bruxism and gastroesophageal reflux disease (gerd).  there seems to be an association between bruxism, respiratory problems, and dental caries in children.  bruxism with reflux symptoms for extensive time-periods was associated with severe tooth wear for the whole dentition (odds ratio, 4.70, 95% confidence interval, 2.04⁻10.83).  the aim of the present study was to determine whether there is an association between respiratory problems and dental caries in children who exhibit the habit of bruxism.  a statistically significant association was found between respiratory problems and dental caries among the children with bruxism.  background reflux disease is a common gastrointestinal problem.  in conclusion, strong associations were identified among bruxism, gerd, and tooth wear.  rhythmic masticatory muscle activity, including sleep bruxism (sb), can be induced in healthy individuals by experimental esophageal acidification, which plays an important role in the pathogenesis of gastroesophageal reflux disease (gerd).  after adjustment, gerd was identified as a risk factor of bruxism.  support to the existence of an association between bruxism and psychosocial disorders has been provided.  sleep bruxism is prevalent in gerd patients, and gerd is highly associated with sb.  the association between reflux disease and gastritis pattern is controversial.  the objective of this study was to evaluate the associations among bruxism, gerd, and tooth wear.  current proposed causes of bruxism appear to be a combination of genetic and environmental (g×e) factors, with epigenetics providing a robust framework for investigating g×e interactions, and their involvement in bruxism makes it a suitable candidate for epigenetic research.  the aim of this case-control study was to assess the existence of an association between bruxism and psychosocial disorders in adolescents., participants were chosen among 114, 12-14 year old students (girls).  gastro-esophageal reflux is considered a major culprit in the pathogenesis of barrett's esophagus (be).  bruxism is highly prevalent and defined as abnormal habitual mouth activity including clenching of the teeth and increased jaw muscle activity.  bruxism is often indicated as a risk factor for the occurrence of temporomandibular disorders (tmd).  respiratory problems, such as asthma and upper airway infections, are reported to be the etiological factors of bruxism. ||| ",Yes
Is single-cell analysis (SCA) possible in proteomics?,Yes,"Single-cell analysis in proteomics, also known as single-cell proteomics (SCP), is indeed possible and has been gaining popularity in recent years. This method allows for the investigation of individual cell-specific properties and inhomogeneous cellular responses, which are not subjected to ensemble-averaging or heterogeneous cell population effects. The advancement in technologies for single-cell isolation, amplification of genome/transcriptome, and next-generation sequencing has enabled SCP to reveal the inherent properties of a single cell at high resolution. Single-cell mass spectrometry (SCMS) is a recently introduced method that enables sensitive detection and accurate analysis of broad ranges of cellular species on the individual-cell level. The field of single-cell proteomics represents a highly sensitive proteomic analysis due to the minute amount of yet complex proteins in a single cell.","single cell proteomics is an emerging field of bioanalysis allowing one to capture proteome profiles of isolated single cells, which is expected to yield additional biological information in comparison with bulk cell analysis.  single cell analytics for proteomic analysis is considered a key method in the framework of systems nanobiology which allows a novel proteomics without being subjected to ensemble-averaging, cell-cycle, or cell-population effects.  single cell analysis (sca) has gained increased popularity for elucidating cellular heterogeneity at genomic, proteomic and cellular levels.  mass spectrometry-based proteomics is actively embracing quantitative, single-cell level analyses.  proteomics at single-cell resolution can help to identify the heterogeneity among cell populations, shows more and more significance in current chemistry and biology.  indeed, recent advances in sample preparation and mass spectrometry (ms) have enabled the emergence of quantitative ms-based single-cell proteomics (scp).  in single cell analysis (sca), individual cell-specific properties and inhomogeneous cellular responses are being investigated that is not subjected to ensemble-averaging or heterogeneous cell population effects.  quantification of single-cell proteomics provides key insights in the field of cellular heterogeneity.  single-cell proteomics represents a field of extremely sensitive proteomic analysis, owing to the minute amount of yet complex proteins in a single cell.  single cell mass spectrometry (scms) enables sensitive detection and accurate analysis of broad ranges of cellular species on the individual-cell level.  we believed that sccp would be one of the powerful alternatives for proteomics at single-cell resolution.  for proteomic single cell analysis, ultra-sensitive and reproducible separation and detection techniques are essential.  single-cell proteomics by mass spectrometry (scope-ms) is a recently introduced method to quantify multiplexed single-cell proteomes.  the advancement in technologies for single cell isolation, amplification of genome/transcriptome and next-generation sequencing enables scs to reveal the inherent properties of a single cell from the large scale of the genome, transcriptome or epigenome at high resolution.  single-cell sequencing (scs) is a promising new technique used to assess the genomics, transcriptomics, epigenetics, and other multi-omics at the single-cell level.  without amplification potential as of nucleic acids, single-cell mass spectrometry (ms) analysis demands special instrumentation running with optimized parameters to maximize the sensitivity and throughput for comprehensive proteomic discovery.  meanwhile, microfluidic single cell analysis (msca) exhibits integration, miniaturization, and high throughput, which can considerably improve the efficiency of single-cell analysis.  in this work, we demonstrated a new single cell chemical proteomic (sccp) strategy with a membrane-permeable activity-based probe (abp) to characterize the functional proteins in lysosome located in the cytosol.  single-cell metabolomics (scm) is currently one of the most powerful tools for performing high-throughput metabolic analysis at the cellular level.  single cell rna sequencing (scrna-seq) is applied to assay the individual transcriptomes of large numbers of cells. ||| ",No
Are microRNA (miR) regulated through DNA methylation of their promoters?,Yes,"The regulation of microRNA (miR) through DNA methylation of their promoters has been demonstrated in various studies. DNA methylation, a critical regulator of gene expression, can also regulate miRNA expression. This epigenetic regulation is more prevalent than previously thought, with 6.9% of known mature miRNAs shown to be regulated by DNA methylation. DNA methylation can inhibit the transcription of miRNAs, similar to coding genes, by methylating the CpG islands in the promoter regions of miRNAs. Aberrant DNA methylation can lead to the dysregulation of miRNAs, which has been linked to the development and progression of several human cancers.","the review highlights the complex interplay between microrna and methylation at dna and mrna level.  microrna genes themselves are regulated through epigenetic mechanisms, such as histone modifications and/or dna methylation of cpg islands.  mirnas and dna methylation are both critical regulators of gene expression.  while a small number of mirnas is known to be regulated by dna methylation, we postulated that such epigenetic regulation is more prevalent.  it has been shown that mirna expression can be regulated by dna methylation and it has been suggested that altered mirna gene methylation might contribute to human tumorigenesis.  the dysregulation of micrornas (mirnas) contributes to the pathogenesis of human malignancies, and mirna expression can be affected by genetic and epigenetic changes, such as methylation of the cpg islands of their promoters.  cross-linking immunoprecipiation qpcr, transfection with methylation/unmethylated mimic mirna, luciferase promoter reporter plasmid, biotin-tagged 3'utr/mrna or mirna experiments and in vivo assays were used to investigate the role of methylated mirnas.  from the total of 2588 known mature mirna 6.9% (180/2588) mirnas have been shown to be epigenetically regulated by dna methylation.  conversely, certain mirnas can directly target dna methyltransferases and bring about their inhibition, thereby affecting the whole genome methylation pattern.  recent studies have demonstrated that epigenetic mechanisms, including dna methylation and histone modification, not only regulate the expression of protein-encoding genes, but also mirnas, such as let-7a, mir-9, mir-34a, mir-124, mir-137, mir-148 and mir-203.  abnormal microrna (mirna) expression has been linked to the development and progression of several human cancers, and such dysregulation can result from aberrant dna methylation.  literature reports that mature microrna (mirna) can be methylated at adenosine, guanosine and cytosine.  we found 64 mirnas to be robustly methylated in hct116 cells; eighteen of them were located in imprinting regions or already reported to be regulated by dna methylation.  dna methylation can inhibit the transcription of mirnas, just like coding genes, by methylating the cpg islands in the promoter regions of mirnas.  micrornas (mirs) modulate the expression of target genes in the signal pathway on transcriptome level.  recent studies have shown that the effect of mirnas on dna methylation by targeting dna methyltransferase (dnmts) and/or mbps plays an important role in various human cancers.  relationships between mir methylation, transcription, gc development, and clinicopathological characteristics were statistically analyzed.  conversely, another subset of mirnas controls the expression of important epigenetic regulators, including dna methyltransferases, histone deacetylases and polycomb group genes.  micrornas (mirnas) are a class of non-coding, single-stranded rna molecules that regulate gene expression at the posttranscriptional level.  methylation of mir cpg islands may significantly down-regulate their transcription regularly. ||| ",Yes

However, there is no mention of a ""ripple effect of transcription"" in the context. The term ""ripple effect"" typically refers to a situation in which a small initial change has a much larger impact on a system over time. In the context of transcription, this could refer to a situation in which a small change in gene expression leads to a large change in the production of a particular protein. However, the context does not provide any information about the relationship between iEEG recordings and transcription, and therefore it is not possible to determine whether iEEG recordings create a ""ripple effect of transcription.""","ripples that were visualized consistently using both ordinary filters and the eeg″ method should be true, but failure to clarify ripples using the eeg″ method does not mean that true ripples are absent.  we sought to determine if ripple oscillations (80-120 hz), detected in intracranial electroencephalogram (ieeg) recordings of patients with epilepsy, correlate with an enhancement or disruption of verbal episodic memory encoding.  we excluded such possibility from at least some ripples by eeg differentiation, which, in theory, enhances high-frequency signals and does not generate spurious oscillations or ringing.  although physiological and pathological ripple oscillations were not distinguished during cognitive tasks, our results show an association of undifferentiated ripples with impaired encoding.  we found that the occurrence of ieds is modified by whether a subject is attending to a word displayed on screen or is observing a blank screen.  the interaction of cortical modules in sleep and wake in tle may influence the appearance of ieds on scalp eeg; in addition, ieds could be proxies for cerebral oscillation perturbation.  we found that ieds were associated with an increase in low-frequency power and a change in the balance between low- and high-frequency oscillations for several seconds.  the impacts of ied presence, duration, and propagation to neocortex during encoding of individual stimuli were assessed.  however, it is currently unknown how these epileptic ics depend on the presence of interictal epileptic discharges (ieds) in the eeg.  the goal of this study was to explore the relation between ics obtained from fmri epochs during the occurrence of ieds in the eeg and those without ieds.  furthermore, ieds have been shown to impair memory when they occur in certain regions during the encoding or recall phases of a memory task.  we defined ripple and spike events in depth ieeg recordings during list learning in 107 patients with focal epilepsy.  as controls, subjects with maximum activation in the ied generating region were selected.  the influence of ieds during recall was further investigated by comparing the likelihood of ieds preceding correctly recalled items vs. periods of no verbal response.  interictal epileptiform discharges (ieds) constitute a perturbation of ongoing cerebral rhythms, usually more frequent during sleep.  ripple-band epileptic high-frequency oscillations (hfos) can be recorded by scalp electroencephalography (eeg), and tend to be associated with epileptic spikes.  we used logistic regression models (lrms) to investigate the relationship between the occurrence of ripple and spike events during word presentation and the odds of successful word recall following a distractor epoch and included the seizure onset zone (soz) as a covariate in the lrms.  the probability of ripple on spike (rons) events was increased in the soz (p < 0.04).  we introduce here a process that modifies the eeg in a predictable manner so as to increase the incidence of a particular pattern.  interictal epileptiform discharges during encoding, maintenance, and recall did not significantly impact task performance, and there was no significant difference between the likelihood of ieds during correct recall vs. periods of no response. ||| ",Yes
Is COL5A2 gene associated to ischemic heart disease?,No,"The provided context does not mention the COL5A2 gene, but rather discusses the association of other genes such as C5L2, NT5C2, COX-2, COL1A2, and ALOX5AP with coronary artery disease (CAD) and myocardial infarction (MI). Therefore, based on the given context, it cannot be concluded that the COL5A2 gene is associated with ischemic heart disease.","the aim of the present study is to evaluate the association of a novel variation (901a > g) of c5l2 gene with coronary artery disease (cad).  increasing studies have reported that 5'-nucleotidase cytosolic ii (nt5c2) has a strong relationship with coronary heart disease (chd) development.  previous case-control studies suggested the single nucleotide polymorphism of cyclooxygenase-2 (cox-2) gene (g-765c) is associated with coronary artery disease (cad) and ischemic stroke.  however, little is known about the variations in the coding region of the c5l2 gene and their association with coronary artery disease (cad).  the rs2621215 snp in intron 46 of the col1a2 gene was found to be marginally associated with an increased risk of ia development in the korean population examined.  the cyclooxygenase-2 (cox-2) rs20417 polymorphism has been implicated in coronary artery disease (cad) risk, but individually published studies have shown inconsistent results.  the aim of this study was to explore the role of variants of the gene encoding arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein (alox5ap) as possible susceptibility factors for coronary artery disease (cad) and myocardial infarction (mi) in patients with or without angiographically proven cad.  in this study, we investigated whether the rs42524 and rs2621215 polymorphisms of the col1a2 gene are associated with the development of cerebral aneurysms in the korean population.  lipoprotein-associated phospholipase a2 (lp-pla2) activity has been reported to be associated with coronary artery disease (cad) and myocardial infarction (mi).  conclusions this meta-analysis suggests col1a2 rs42524 is a significant risk factor for ia susceptibility, with an especially strong effect in asian people.  our objective was to study whether the functional c variant of the -765g-->c polymorphism in the human cox-2 gene associates with the severity of coronary atherosclerosis measured at the coronary artery level.  in conclusion, we demonstrate that cox-2 rs5277 c allele increases the risk of left main coronary artery lesion and is also correlated with poor prognosis of lmcad patients with cabg therapy.  significant association between cox-2 rs20417 polymorphism and risk of cad was observed in co-dominant model (or=0.64, 95% ci=0.43-0.95, p=0.026) and recessive model (or=0.77, 95% ci=0.61-0.97, p=0.025).  rs2148198 of nt5c2 was strongly associated with an increased risk of chd (allele: p = 0.045; codominant: p = 0.007; additive: p = 0.016).  this study suggests that the cox2 -765g>c polymorphism is a possible genetic determinant for the risk of cad, and an individual risk factor in koreans.  we performed a meta-analysis to assess the association between col1a2 rs42524 polymorphism and the risk of intracranial aneurysm.  pooling results indicated a significant association between col1a2 rs42524 polymorphism and intracranial aneurysm risk under 4 genetic models (c vs. g: or=1.74, 95%ci=1.34-2.26; gc vs. gg: or=1.81, 95%ci=1.37-2.41; cc+gc vs. gg: or=1.74, 95%ci=1.28-2.36; cc vs. gc+gg: or=1.76, 95%ci=1.02-3.04).  furtherly, long-term follow-up data suggested that rs5277 c allele carriage increased risk of major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (macce) in the whole cohort (adjusted hr: 1.561; 95% ci: 1.025~2.377; p = 0.038) and lmcad subgroup (adjusted hr: 2.014; 95% ci: 1.036~3.913; p = 0.039) but not in mpcad subgroup (adjusted hr: 1.375; 95% ci: 0.791~2.392; p = 0.259).  in this study, we genotyped cox-2 rs5275, rs5277, and rs689466 of 1544 cad patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (cabg) and found that rs5277 c allele carriage was associated with lmcad (adjusted or: 1.590; 95% ci: 1.103~2.291; p = 0.013).  background col1a2, which encodes collagen type i alpha2, has long been suggested to be a potential positional and functional candidate gene for intracranial aneurysm. ||| ",Yes
Does the histone chaperone ASF1 interact with histones H1/H2?,No,"The histone chaperone ASF1 has been identified as a highly conserved histone H3/H4 chaperone, involved in DNA replication, repair, and transcription. It has been shown to interact with histones H3 and H4, and its interaction with these histones is crucial for its function in vivo and in vitro. The geometry of the interaction indicates that ASF1 binds to histones H3/H4 in a manner that likely blocks the H3/H3 interface of the nucleosomal four-helix bundle. Furthermore, investigations on chromatin assembly in vitro implicate chromatin assembly factor 1 (CAF-1) as a chaperone for histones H3/H4 and nucleosome assembly protein 1 (NAP1) as a chaperone for histones H2A/H2B. However, there is no mention of ASF1 interacting with histones H1/H2 in the provided context. Therefore, it can be concluded that the histone chaperone ASF1 does not interact with histones H1/H2.","interactions with both h3 and h4 were required for asf1 histone chaperone function in vivo and in vitro.  here we report the structure of a histone/histone chaperone interaction.  asf1 is a highly conserved histone h3/h4 chaperone that synergizes in vitro with two other histone chaperones, chromatin assembly factor 1 (caf-1) and histone repression a factor (hira), in dna synthesis-coupled and dna synthesis-independent nucleosome assembly.  asf1 is a histone chaperone that favors histone h3/h4 assembly and disassembly.  histone chaperones are involved in a variety of chromatin transactions.  the histone chaperone asf1 assists in chromatin assembly and remodeling during replication, transcription activation, and gene silencing.  by a proteomics survey, we identified the interaction networks of histone chaperones asf1, caf1, hira, and nap1.  the histone h3/h4 chaperone asf1p is highly conserved and is involved in dna replication, dna repair, and transcription.  snasp and asf1 are conserved histone chaperones that interact with histones h3 and h4 and are found in a multi-chaperoning complex in vivo previously we identified a short peptide motif within h3 that binds to the tpr domain of snasp with nanomolar affinity.  the protein anti-silencing function 1 (asf1) chaperones histones h3/h4 for assembly into nucleosomes every cell cycle as well as during dna transcription and repair.  the geometry of the interaction indicates that asf1 binds to histones h3/h4 in a manner that likely blocks sterically the h3/h3 interface of the nucleosomal four-helix bundle.  investigations on chromatin assembly in vitro implicate chromatin assembly factor 1 (caf1) as a chaperone for histones h3/h4 and nucleosome assembly protein 1 (nap1) as a chaperone for histones h2a/h2b.  asf1 is known to directly bind histone h3, however, high-resolution structural information about the geometry of this interaction was previously unknown.  anti-silencing function 1 (asf1) is an evolutionarily conserved histone h3-h4 chaperone involved in the assembly/disassembly of nucleosome and histone modification.  the hira histone chaperone complex, composed of hira, ubinuclein-1 (ubn1) and cabin1, cooperates with the histone chaperone asf1a to mediate h3.3-specific binding and chromatin deposition.  here, we identify mutants of histones h3.1 and h3.3 that are unable to interact with human asf1a and asf1b isoforms but that are still competent to bind caf-1 and hira, respectively.  histone chaperones are proteins that interact with histones to regulate the thermodynamic process of nucleosome assembly.  the ability of histone chaperone anti-silencing factor 1 (asf1) to direct acetylation of lysine 56 of histone h3 (h3k56ac) represents an important regulatory step in genome replication and dna repair.  the histone h3/h4 chaperone asf1 (anti-silencing function 1) is required for the establishment and maintenance of proper chromatin structure, as well as for genome stability in eukaryotes.  chromatin assembly factor 1 (caf-1) is a histone h3-h4 chaperone that deposits newly synthesized histone (h3-h4)2 tetramers during replication-coupled nucleosome assembly. ||| ",No
Could Hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) be effective for the treatment of recurrent ovarian cancer?,Yes,"Hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) has been proposed as a treatment for recurrent ovarian cancer. It has shown promise in the treatment of ovarian carcinosis and has been used in the treatment of ovarian cancer. HIPEC, in combination with maximal cytoreductive surgery, has been applied to treat ovarian cancer, resulting in long-term survival rates in selected patients. It has been debated to be a viable option for the treatment of advanced epithelial ovarian cancer with peritoneal carcinomatosis. HIPEC is often used to treat gastrointestinal malignancies and is of interest in epithelial ovarian cancer given the propensity for intraperitoneal spread. Although the standard of care after recurrence of epithelial ovarian cancer is chemotherapy, increasing data suggest that combining cytoreductive surgery with intraoperative HIPEC is a promising option for patients with recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer. HIPEC is increasingly used in the treatment of ovarian, tubal, and primary peritoneal cancer. The feasibility and safety of HIPEC associated with cytoreductive surgery have been assessed in patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis resulting from primary advanced or relapsing epithelial ovarian cancer. HIPEC and complete surgical removal of the tumor, in relapsing patients, may provide a clinical benefit.

Does ghrelin play a role in ischemic stroke?,Yes,"Ghrelin has been shown to play a significant role in ischemic stroke, as evidenced by pre-clinical studies. The hormone has been found to be neuroprotective, inhibiting inflammation, nNOS activity, and apoptosis in focal cerebral ischemia through a vagal pathway. Post-stroke treatment with des-acylated ghrelin has been demonstrated to protect against ischemia/reperfusion-induced brain injury, swelling, and BBB disruption by reducing oxidative and/or nitrosative damage. Furthermore, exogenous ghrelin treatment has been shown to improve cell survival, reduce infarct size, and rescue memory deficits in focal ischemia models by suppressing inflammation and apoptosis. The neuroprotective effects of ghrelin have been observed in both the acute and late phases after stroke.","in this review we discuss pre-clinical evidence suggesting ghrelin may be a useful therapeutic in protecting the brain against injury after ischemic stroke.  recent evidence suggests that ghrelin may also be neuroprotective after injury in animal models of cerebral ischemia.  we will also discuss its proposed mechanisms of action, including anti-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory effects, and suggest ghrelin treatment may be a useful intervention after stroke in the clinic.  collectively, these results demonstrate that post-stroke treatment with des-acylated ghrelin, but not acylated ghrelin, protects against ischaemia/reperfusion-induced brain injury and swelling, and bbb disruption, by reducing oxidative and/or nitrosative damage.  here, we investigated whether post-stroke treatment with acylated ghrelin or des-acylated ghrelin could improve functional and histological endpoints of stroke outcome in mice after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tmcao).  human ghrelin is thus a neuroprotective agent that inhibits inflammation, nnos activity, and apoptosis in focal cerebral ischemia through a vagal pathway.  specifically, we will discuss evidence showing ghrelin administration can improve neuronal cell survival in animal models of focal cerebral ischemia, as well as rescue memory deficits.  however, the effect of ghrelin in permanent focal cerebral ischemia and the role of the vagus nerve in its action remain unknown.  here, we aimed to determine whether endogenous ghrelin normally protects against neuronal cell death and cognitive impairments after global cerebral ischemia and whether such changes are linked with inflammation or apoptosis.  our data demonstrate that endogenous ghrelin plays a crucial role in protecting heart function and reducing mortality after myocardial infarction, and that these effects seem to be partly the result of sympathetic inhibition.  the hormone ghrelin prevents a dangerous increase in cardiac sympathetic nerve activity (sna) after acute myocardial infarction (mi), although the underlying mechanisms remain unknown.  thus exogenous ghrelin treatment can improve cell survival, reduce infarct size, and rescue memory deficits in focal ischemia models, doing so by suppressing inflammation and apoptosis.  accumulated research data have shown that acyl ghrelin exercises a significant neuroprotective effect against cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (i/r) injury in animal models and in cultured neurons during the acute phase, usually, 1 day after cerebral ischemia.  our study suggests that acyl ghrelin may be promising to restore the neuronal structure in the late phase after stroke.  our results suggested that in the cardiovascular system, ghrelin not only has an anti-inflammatory effect, but also has a significant immunoregulatory effect that may be mediated through the ghsr-1a receptor.  this study investigated the effect and potential mechanisms of ghrelin on hcy-induced endothelial dysfunction.  ghrelin, a novel growth hormone-releasing peptide, is implicated to play a protective role in cardiovascular tissues.  ghrelin, a brain-gut peptide, has been proven to exert neuroprotection in different kinds of neurological diseases; however, its role and the potential molecular mechanisms in secondary brain injury (sbi) after intracerebral hemorrhage (ich) are still unknown.  however, no study has examined whether endogenous ghrelin also contributes to neuroprotection after cerebral ischemia.  results showed that ghrelin attenuated neurobehavioral deficits, brain edema, hematoma volume, and perihematomal cell death post-ich. ||| ",Yes
Is there any involvement of L1 retrotransposition in the Rett syndrome?,Yes,"The involvement of L1 retrotransposition in Rett Syndrome is suggested by the increased expression of L1 elements in patients with this disorder. L1 retrotransposition is a process by which L1 elements, a type of non-LTR retrotransposon, insert themselves into the genome. This process has been implicated in various genetic defects and is responsible for approximately 1/1,000 disease-causing mutations in humans. The L1 elements require two proteins, ORF1p and ORF2p, for retrotransposition, which can occur in the germline, during early development, and in select somatic cells. Although the host response to L1 retrotransposition is not fully understood, recent studies have shown that L1 retrotransposition can occur within the human brain, leading to somatic mosaicism in the hippocampus and cerebellum. This suggests that de novo L1 retrotransposition events may contribute to individual somatic mosaicism and potentially play a role in the development of Rett Syndrome.","l1 (line-1) is an interspersed non-ltr retrotransposon and several genetic defects caused by l1 transposition have been reported.  like other non-ltr retrotransposons, l1 insertion into chromosomal dna apparently occurs by target-site primed reverse transcription, or tprt.  rett syndrome is usually sporadic, but rare pedigrees with nonpenetrance in obligate carriers and possible anticipation suggest that it could be caused by a triplet repeat expansion (tre).  in mammalian genomes, most retrocopies emerged via the l1 retrotransposition machinery.  l1s can retrotranspose in the germline, during early development and in select somatic cells; however, the host response to l1 retrotransposition remains largely unexplored.  these data suggest that de novo l1 retrotransposition events may occur in the human brain and, in principle, have the potential to contribute to individual somatic mosaicism.  de novo line-1 (long interspersed element-1, or l1) retrotransposition events are responsible for approximately 1/1,000 disease-causing mutations in humans.  rett syndrome is a progressive neurological development syndrome.  retrotransposition requires two l1-encoded proteins, orf1p and orf2p.  l1 retrotransposition has shaped our genome via insertional mutagenesis, sequence transduction, pseudogene formation, and ectopic recombination.  l1s must retrotranspose in the germ line or during early development to ensure their evolutionary success, yet the extent to which this process affects somatic cells is poorly understood.  a large fraction of the human genome is attributable to l1 retrotransposon sequences.  individual l1 elements within a genome differ in sequence and retrotransposition activity.  nonetheless, l1 expression has been shown to be increased in patients with rett syndrome and schizophrenia.  the line-1 (l1) retrotransposon emerges as a major source of human interindividual genetic variation, with important implications for evolution and disease.  long interspersed element 1 (line-1 or l1) retrotransposons have markedly affected the human genome.  l1 is a ubiquitous interspersed repeated sequence in mammals that achieved its high copy number by autonomous retrotransposition.  recently, retrotransposition of l1 was shown to occur within human brain leading to somatic mosaicism in hippocampus and cerebellum.  long interspersed element-1 retrotransposons (line-1 or l1) are ∼6 kb mobile dna elements implicated in the origins of many mendelian and complex diseases.  long interspersed element-1 (line-1 or l1) retrotransposition continues to affect human genome evolution. ||| ",Yes

The use of bioactive and biomimetic materials can promote bone tissue regeneration and direct cell response. The development of these 3D bioprinted models can allow for the advancement of novel therapy testing, resulting in possible relief to chronic diseases such as osteoporosis. The use of chemically modified mRNAs, together with biomaterials, has also been explored as a potential approach for the clinical treatment of bone injury and defects. The reported results suggest that promising hybrid systems suitable for 3D printing of bioactive scaffolds for bone tissue engineering have been developed. The need for successful bone tissue engineering strategies and advanced biomaterials that mimic the structure and function of native tissues is growing. Bone-tissue regeneration induced by biomimetic bioactive materials is a promising approach alternative to the clinical ones used to treat bone loss caused by trauma or diseases such as osteoporosis.","in this review, we will discuss the potential of 3d bioprinting of bone tissue in the following disease states: osteoporosis, paget's disease, heterotopic ossification, osteosarcoma, osteogenesis imperfecta, and rickets disease.  in this context, our study aimed to develop a hybrid bioactive material suitable for 3d printing of scaffolds mimicking the natural composition and structure of healthy bone.  in this scenario, the bone tissue regeneration may be promoted using bioactive and biomimetic materials able to direct cell response, while the desired scaffold architecture can be tailored by means of 3d printing technologies.  bone tissue engineering offers an alternative promising solution to treat a large number of bone injuries with special focus on pathological conditions, such as osteoporosis.  remodeling of bone by tissue engineering is a realistic option for treating several bone-related pathophysiological ailments such as osteoporosis, bone tumor, bone cancer or abnormal bone development.  the development of these 3d bioprinted models will allow for the advancement of novel therapy testing resulting in possible relief to these chronic diseases.  this study exploits chemically modified mrnas, together with biomaterials, as a potential approach for the clinical treatment of bone injury and defects.  in conclusion, the reported results suggest that promising hybrid systems suitable for 3d printing of bioactive scaffolds for bone tissue engineering have been developed.  there is a growing need for successful bone tissue engineering strategies and advanced biomaterials that mimic the structure and function of native tissues carry great promise.  bone-tissue regeneration induced by biomimetic bioactive materials is the most promising approach alternative to the clinical ones used to treat bone loss caused by trauma or diseases such as osteoporosis.  bone tissue engineering is an emerging field of regenerative medicine that holds promise for the restoration of bones affected by trauma, neoplastic diseases, and congenital deformity.  clinical imperatives for new bone to replace or restore the function of traumatized or bone lost as a consequence of age or disease has led to the need for therapies or procedures to generate bone for skeletal applications.  tissue engineering has promoted structures that can simulate the extracellular matrix and are capable of guiding natural bone repair using signaling molecules to promote osteoinduction and angiogenesis essential in the formation of new bone tissues.  engineering of viable bone substitutes that can be personalized to meet specific clinical needs represents a promising therapeutic alternative.  to fight bone diseases characterized by poor bone quality like osteoporosis and osteoarthritis, as well as in reconstructive surgery, there is a need for a new generation of implantable biomaterials.  the goal is to design nanostructured bioactive constructs able to reproduce the physiological environment: by mimicking the natural features of bone tissue, the cell behavior during the regeneration process may be addressed.  in the last few years, rna-mediated gene therapy has captured attention as a new tool for bone regeneration.  these results pave the way for growing patient-specific bone substitutes for reconstructive treatments of the skeletal system and for constructing qualified experimental models of development and disease.  in this review, we discuss the use of rna molecules in coating and delivery, including messenger rna (mrna), rna interference (rnai), and long non-coding rna (lncrna) on different types of scaffolds (such as polymers, ceramics, and metals) in osteogenesis research.  from clinical applications to creating alternative structural materials, bone tissue engineering has been advancing constantly, and it is relevant to regularly update related topics. ||| ",Yes
Are there ways of joint Bayesian inference of risk variants?,Yes,"Bayesian inference methods have been developed for jointly modeling the effects of multiple genetic variants on a phenotype of interest. These methods, such as the Bayesian hierarchical regression approach, can incorporate prior information on the likelihood of variant causality through weighting of variant effects. This approach allows for the joint modeling of multiple variables and can offer advantages over conventional model building strategies. Additionally, Bayesian models for genomic prediction and association mapping are increasingly being used in genetics analysis of quantitative traits. These models can potentially borrow the strength of historical information and become more popular for their applications to clinical trials. Therefore, there are ways of joint Bayesian inference of risk variants.","working within the multivariate linear regression framework helps us to account for the joint effects of multiple genes; and adopting a bayesian approach leads to posterior probabilities that coherently incorporate all information about the variants' function.  here we develop and evaluate a bayesian hierarchical regression method that incorporates prior information on the likelihood of variant causality through weighting of variant effects.  standard statistical approaches for prioritization of variants for functional testing in fine-mapping studies either use marginal association statistics or estimate posterior probabilities for variants to be causal under simplifying assumptions.  bayesian statistical methods have recently made great inroads into many areas of science, and this advance is now extending to the assessment of association between genetic variants and disease or other phenotypes.  bayesian approaches can model multiple variables together and offer advantages over conventional model building strategies, including using existing biological evidence as modeling priors and acknowledging that many models may fit the data well.  we describe two novel prior distributions that facilitate learning the role of each variable site by borrowing evidence across phenotypes and across mutations in the same gene.  for genome-wide association studies with family-based designs, we propose a bayesian approach.  we developed a likelihood-based approach for analyzing summary-level statistics and external linkage disequilibrium information to estimate effect-size distributions of common variants, characterized by the proportion of underlying susceptibility snps and a flexible normal-mixture model for their effects.  accordingly, we project the risk-prediction ability of polygenic risk scores across a wide variety of diseases.  we devise efficient algorithms that estimate the parameters of our model across all risk loci to further increase performance.  probabilistic risk analyses often construct multistage chance trees to estimate the joint probability of compound events.  a key feature of our approach is that it empirically estimates the contribution of each functional annotation to the trait of interest directly from summary association statistics while allowing for multiple causal variants at any risk locus.  assuming that prior information varies over some classes of priors, we develop the concept of robust bayes estimation into the context of allele frequency estimation.  bayesian models for genomic prediction and association mapping are being increasingly used in genetics analysis of quantitative traits.  through the use of an informative prior, bayesian methodologies could potentially borrow the strength of historical information and become more and more popular for their applications to clinical trials.  we show that standard transmission disequilibrium test and family-based association test statistics can naturally be implemented in a bayesian framework, allowing flexible specification of the likelihood and prior odds.  to allow for uncertainties in parameter values, one may employ bayesian techniques or, in a maximum-likelihood framework, construct a support interval (si) for the risk.  here, we present a probabilistic framework that integrates association strength with functional genomic annotation data to improve accuracy in selecting plausible causal variants for functional validation.  we introduced an extremely flexible analysis framework capable of efficiently performing bayesian variable selection on many candidate variables.  we first assume that the region of interest is a single locus and the prior information is represented in terms of a class of beta distributions, and present explicit forms of the resulting bayes and robust bayes estimators. ||| ",Yes
Is Tofacitinib effective for Ulcerative Colitis?,Yes,"Justification: Tofacitinib, a pan-janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor, has been shown to be effective in treating patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis (UC). It has demonstrated efficacy in inducing clinical response and remission in patients with active UC in a dose-dependent manner.

It has been found to be effective in protecting from colitis by inhibiting a bundle of T cell-derived cytokines such as IL-5, IL-6, IL-9, IL-13, and IL-17a. Tofacitinib has also been shown to suppress acute and chronic oxazolone colitis in mice, associated with downregulation of cytokines produced by TH2, TH9, and TH17 cells. However, it is important to note that while Tofacitinib has proven efficacious in patients with active UC, it failed in patients with Crohn's disease (CD).","here, we examined the safety and efficacy of tofacitinib in active ulcerative colitis (uc).  tofacitinib, a pan-jak inhibitor, showed efficacy in ulcerative colitis  and has been approved for the treatment of patients with moderate to severe uc.  tofacitinib is a partially selective janus kinase inhibitor approved for the treatment of refractory moderate to severe ulcerative colitis .  tofacitinib, a novel, oral janus kinase inhibitor, demonstrated a dose-dependent efficacy for induction of clinical response and remission in patients with active ulcerative colitis (uc).  tofacitinib is a janus kinase inhibitor indicated to treat adult patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (uc).  tofacitinib is an oral, small-molecule janus kinase inhibitor for the treatment of ulcerative colitis (uc).  thus, our findings suggest that tofacitinib is quite effective in protecting from colitis by inhibition of a bundle of t cell derived cytokines like il-5, il-6, il-9, il-13 and il-17a.  tofacitinib is a first-in-class, partially selective inhibitor of janus kinase, recently approved for treating patients with ulcerative colitis (uc).  here, we analysed the inhibitory effect of tofacitinib on mucosal and blood t cells from patients with ulcerative colitis (uc).  tofacitinib is an oral, small-molecule inhibitor of jak approved in several countries for the treatment of ulcerative colitis (uc).  tofacitinib is an oral, small molecule inhibitor of jak for the treatment of ulcerative colitis (uc).  tofacitinib is an oral, small molecule janus kinase (jak) inhibitor for the treatment of ulcerative colitis (uc).  in 2018, the pan-janus kinase (jak) inhibitor tofacitinib was launched for the treatment of ulcerative colitis (uc).  application of tofacitinib emerges as an attractive concept for treatment of chronic intestinal inflammation at lower concentrations, whereas higher concentrations require attention due to prolonged wound healing.  although the clinical efficacy of tofacitinib in patients with ulcerative colitis (uc) has been assessed in the octave trial, there is a lack of adequate data on its efficacy in real-world clinical settings.  we describe our experience with the use of tofacitinib for treatment of patients with moderate-to-severe ibd.  tofacitinib suppressed acute and chronic oxazolone colitis compared to untreated wild-type mice associated with downregulation of cytokines produced by th2, th9 and th17 cells.  tofacitinib is a promising therapeutic agent for the induction and maintenance therapy in uc.  to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of tofacitinib in comparison to vedolizumab for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis (uc) after failure or intolerance to conventional therapy (bio-naive) or first-line biologic treatment (bio-experienced), from the spanish national health system (nhs) perspective.  although tofacitinib has proven efficacious in patients with active uc, it failed in patients with crohn's disease (cd). ||| ",Yes
Is tirilazad effective for treatment of aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage?,Yes,"The efficacy of tirilazad for the treatment of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) has been investigated in a prospective, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled trial conducted at 41 neurosurgical centers in Europe, Australia, and New Zealand. Tirilazad mesylate, a nonglucocorticoid 21-aminosteroid, has been shown to reduce vasospasm following SAH and to reduce infarct size from focal cerebral ischemia in experimental models. The trial aimed to test whether treatment with tirilazad would reduce ischemic symptoms from vasospasm and improve overall outcome in patients with ruptured aneurysms. The results of the trial suggest that tirilazad mesylate, at a dosage of 6 mg/kg per day, is safe and improves overall outcome in patients, especially in men, who have experienced an aneurysmal SAH.","in patients with ct-proven subarachnoid haemorrhage, presumably caused by a ruptured aneurysm, ultra-early, short-term tranexamic acid treatment did not improve clinical outcome at 6 months, as measured by the modified rankin scale.  to assess the efficacy and safety of tirilazad in patients with aneurysmal sah.  in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage, short-term antifibrinolytic therapy with tranexamic acid has been shown to reduce the risk of rebleeding.  the management of patients with subarachnoid haemorrhage following rupture of an intracranial aneurysm is changing.  to test whether treatment with tirilazad would reduce ischemic symptoms from vasospasm and improve overall outcome in patients with ruptured aneurysms, a prospective randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled trial was conducted at 41 neurosurgical centers in europe, australia, and new zealand.  tirilazad mesylate, a nonglucocorticoid 21-aminosteroid, has been shown in experimental models to reduce vasospasm following subarachnoid hemorrhage (sah) and to reduce infarct size from focal cerebral ischemia.  a phase 1/2a double-blinded randomized controlled trial (2:1 randomization) to assess the safety of a 7-day intravenous infusion of tirofiban compared with placebo, in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage treated with ventriculostomy placed in the operative room and coiling was conducted.  a database of patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage was analyzed who were confirmed by ct, and underwent endovascular treatment between january 2005 and january 2012,.  background the isat (international subarachnoid aneurysm trial) has generated a paradigm shift towards endovascular treatment for intracranial aneurysms but remains unclear if this has led to a true reduction in the risk for aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (asah).  timing of treatment of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage has been controversial.  a prospective series of 30 patients with a single, angiographically verified aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (sah) was studied for the effect of intrathecal thrombolytic therapy with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-pa) on outcome, angiographic vasospasm, and computerized tomography (ct) findings after surgery.  endovascular treatment of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage which was confirmed by ct within 72 hours achieved better outcomes than that confirmed after 72 hours, especially in those patients treated within 24 hours of onset in comparison with patients treated between 4 and 10 days.  the aim of this survey was to evaluate the current provision of peri-operative care for patients with an aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage in the united kingdom and republic of ireland.  this retrospective study was designed to access the safety and efficacy among cohorts of different timing of endovascular treatment patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage.  in this multicentre prospective, randomised, controlled, open-label trial with masked outcome assessment, adult patients with spontaneous ct-proven subarachnoid haemorrhage in eight treatment centres and 16 referring hospitals in the netherlands were randomly assigned to treatment with tranexamic acid in addition to care as usual (tranexamic acid group) or care as usual only (control group).  aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage (asah) is associated with significant morbidity and mortality.  aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (sah) with associated intracerebral hemorrhage (ich) is often treated with concomitant surgical clipping and ich evacuation.  these observations suggest that tirilazad mesylate, at a dosage of 6 mg/kg per day, is safe and improves overall outcome in patients (especially in men) who have experienced an aneurysmal sah.  subarachnoid haemorrhage is a fairly common condition and a neurosurgical emergency.  the presumed effectiveness of induced hypertension for treating delayed cerebral ischemia after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage is based on uncontrolled case-series only. ||| ",No
Is insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) able to affect tendon protein synthesis in classic Ehlers-Danlos syndrome patients?,Yes,"Insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) has been shown to stimulate tendon protein synthesis in both young and old men, as evidenced by increased cell proliferation and collagen content in IGF-I treated tendons compared to controls. The study also found that IGF-I and its binding proteins may regulate the translation of mechanical loading to collagen synthesis in tendons. However, the context does not provide information on the effects of IGF-I on tendon protein synthesis specifically in classic Ehlers-Danlos syndrome patients. Therefore, it is not possible to definitively answer the question based on the provided context. However, given the known anabolic effects of IGF-I on tendon protein synthesis, it is plausible that IGF-I could potentially affect tendon protein synthesis in classic Ehlers-Danlos syndrome patients. Further research is needed to confirm this.","in conclusion, local igf-i stimulated tendon protein synthesis in both young and old men, despite lower systemic igf-i levels in the old group.  the purpose of this study was to investigate the in vivo igf-i stimulation of tendon protein synthesis in elderly compared with young men.  insulin-like growth factor i (igf-i) is known to exert an anabolic effect on tendon fibroblast production of collagen.  we investigated the influence of insulin-like growth factor i (igf-i) on tendon construct formation in 3d cell culture.  in animals insulin-like growth factor i (igf-i) stimulates collagen production by fibroblasts and is expressed in tendons together with its binding protein 4 (igfbp-4).  cell proliferation and collagen content of the igf-i treated tendons were increased compared to controls.  insulin-like growth factor i (igf-i) and its binding proteins (igfbps), which are known to stimulate collagen production in animal tendons, may regulate the translation of mechanical loading to collagen synthesis.  we suggest that the igf-i system could be involved in collagen synthesis in tendon in response to mechanical loading.  insulin-like growth factor-i (igf-i) is known to be an anabolic factor in tendon, and the systemic levels are reduced with aging.  recombinant human insulin-like growth factor-i stimulated matrix and dna synthesis of all tendon segments in a dose-dependent manner in intervals from 10 to 1,000 ng/ml.  this study describes the temporal expression of insulin-like growth factor-i (igf-i), transforming growth factor-beta1 (tgf-beta1), and collagen types i and iii in healing tendon lesions.  to determine if differences exist in sensitivity to growth factors that have the potential to influence tendon repair, we compared the effects of recombinant human insulin-like growth factor-i on various types of tendon segments.  we found that tendons injected with igf-i had significantly higher protein fsr compared with controls (old group: 0.018 ± 0.015 vs. 0.008 ± 0.008, young group: 0.016 ± 0.009 vs. 0.009 ± 0.006%/h, mean ± se, p < 0.01).  the present study adds support for the roles of igf-i and igfbp-4 in the regulation of tendon adaptive responses to mechanical loading.  we injected igf-i in the patellar tendons of young (n = 11, 20-30 yr of age) and old (n = 11, 66-75 yr of age) men, and the acute fractional synthesis rate (fsr) of tendon protein was measured with the stable isotope technique and compared with the contralateral side (injected with saline as control).  tendon tissue concentrations of igf-i were found to be 0.53 +/- 0.10 ng/g.  this study investigated the effects of intratendinous injection of igf-i on tendon healing in an equine model of flexor tendinitis.  healing may be improved through intratendinous injection of insulin-like growth factor-i (igf-i), which has been shown in vitro to stimulate mitogenesis and enhance tendon matrix production.  he treatment of overuse tendon injuries with exogenous growth factors such as insulin-like growth factor-i (igf-i) may facilitate an improved return to sustained athletic function.  the growth hormone/insulin-like growth factor-i (gh/igf-i) axis is an important stimulator of collagen synthesis in connective tissue, but the effect of chronically altered gh/igf-i levels on connective tissue of the muscle-tendon unit is not known. ||| ",Yes

Can telomere length shortening be reversed by telomerase?,Yes,"Telomerase, a reverse transcriptase enzyme, contributes to the maintenance of the telomeric structure by adding telomere repeat sequences to chromosomal ends, thus compensating for its shortening. This enzyme counteracts telomere shortening by synthesizing telomeric repeats through repeated cycles of reverse transcription of its internal RNA template. The most common method of restoring telomere length is via telomerase reverse transcriptase activity, which is highly expressed during embryogenesis. Reconstitution of telomerase activity is proposed as a potential gene therapy to prevent, or rescue, age-related diseases produced by critical telomere shortening. Therefore, it can be concluded that telomere length shortening can be reversed by telomerase.","on the other hand, the reverse transcriptase telomerase can add back telomeric repeats at the telomere ends.  these results prove that critically short telomeres can be rescued by telomerase, and become fully functional, thus rescuing premature aging.  the most common method of restoring telomere length is via telomerase reverse transcriptase activity, highly expressed during embryogenesis.  reconstitution of telomerase activity is proposed as a potential gene therapy to prevent, or rescue, age-related diseases produced by critical telomere shortening.  shortening of telomeres along with an up-regulation of telomerase is implicated in the immortality of tumor cells.  telomerase is a cellular reverse transcriptase that extends one strand (the g-strand) of the telomere terminal repeats.  telomerase is a ribonucleoprotein that counteracts telomere shortening and can immortalise human cells.  telomerase is a reverse transcriptase enzyme contributing to the maintenance of the telomeric structure by adding telomere repeat sequences to chromosomal ends, thus compensating for its shortening.  here, we review recent findings that illuminate our understanding of telomerase.  telomerase counteracts this terminal sequence loss by synthesizing telomeric repeats through repeated cycles of reverse transcription of its internal rna template.  when telomeres become sufficiently short, senescence is induced.  telomere shortening controls the entry of cells into senescence.  telomerase, a cellular reverse transcriptase, adds telomeric repeats to chromosome ends.  in this study, published measurements of telomere distributions in human fibroblasts and human endothelial cells were used to show that telomeres shorten in a length-dependent fashion.  while inhibiting telomerase provides a novel approach to the treatment of many cancers, telomere maintenance can occur in the absence of telomerase activity by the alternative lengthening of telomeres (alt) mechanism.  telomerase, via its catalytic component telomerase reverse transcriptase (tert), extends telomeres of eukaryotic chromosomes.  telomerase activity compensates shortening of telomeres during cell division and enables cancer cells to escape senescent processes.  we addressed this by re-introducing telomerase in late generation telomerase-deficient mice, terc-/-, which have short telomeres and show severe proliferative defects.  telomerase is an rna-dependent dna polymerase that compensates for the telomere shortening that occurs in its absence.  evidence is accumulating that telomere shortening and subsequent senescence might play a crucial role in life-threatening diseases. ||| ",Yes
Is it safe to use Abatacept during pregnancy?,No,"The context does not provide specific information regarding the safety of Abatacept during pregnancy. However, it does discuss the use of other medications, including TNF-alpha antagonists, which are considered category B drugs for pregnancy. Abatacept is not a TNF-alpha antagonist, but a selective co-stimulation modulator. While the context does not provide a definitive answer, it is important to note that the safety of medications during pregnancy is often determined through clinical trials and careful monitoring. In the case of Abatacept, further research and evidence would be needed to establish its safety during pregnancy.","we propose that the tnf antagonists, specifically etanercept, be used with caution in pregnant women.  which ones are safe to use during pregnancy, and which ones do we know enough about to tell whether they are safe or not?  with the possible exception of brompheniramine, the commonly used antihistamine drugs appear to be safe during pregnancy.  what are the risks for the baby when the mother uses adhd medications during pregnancy?  as is the case for other psychotropic medications, for ethical reasons, no prospective randomized placebo controlled trial to assess aripiprazole safety during pregnancy has ever been conducted.  determine the drug's safety in pregnant women in our setting and assess its effect on the foetus, drawing on the experience of several hospitals.  we undertook a literature review to document whether certain therapeutic measures could be considered safe during pregnancy in the allergic patient.  when completed, raapp will enable physicians to evaluate the safety of medications commonly used by allergists to treat allergy and asthma during pregnancy.  the use of azathioprine (aza) in the treatment of autoimmune diseases during pregnancy are believed to be relatively safe, particularly taking into account the potential risks for mother and fetus should the underlying disease become active due to withdrawal of this thiopurine.  the aim of this study was to perform a systematic literature search and review to critically evaluate the available data on the use of aripiprazole during pregnancy, peripartum and lactation.  antiepileptic drugs (aeds) are used by pregnant women to manage conditions such as epilepsy and bipolar disorder even though they pose a risk to the developing foetus.  asthma is commonly treated during pregnancy, yet data on the safety of asthma medicines used during pregnancy are sparse.  we describe a patient with psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis who took etanercept 50 mg subcutaneously (sq) twice weekly throughout her pregnancy.  tnf-a antagonists are presumed to be safe in pregnancy based on animal data.  however, essential evidence on the safety of aza use during pregnancy is lacking.  most headache medications should be avoided during pregnancy because of potential fetal risks.  the objectives of the present article are to report experience of anti-tnf-alpha use in pregnancy, and review the international literature.  anti-tumour necrosis factor (tnf)-alpha therapies are considered category b drugs for pregnancy.  available evidence for amphetamines suggests no increased risk of malformations with use of therapeutic doses, and inadvertent exposure during pregnancy is unlikely to be harmful.  intrauterine exposure to 6-tgn may be minimized by careful therapeutic drug monitoring of the mother during pregnancy. ||| ",No
Does the association of PARP1 and CTCF follow a circadian rhythm?,Yes,"The context provided does not mention PARP1 or CTCF, which are Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 and CCCTC-binding factor, respectively. Both are involved in various cellular processes, including DNA repair and transcriptional regulation. However, the context focuses on the circadian clock genes and their role in tumorigenesis, circadian rhythm regulation, and physiological processes. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether the association of PARP1 and CTCF follows a circadian rhythm based on the provided context.","here, we report the discovery that poly(c)-binding protein 1 (pcbp1), displaying a circadian expression pattern, was a novel circadian clock regulator.  the circadian transcription factor clock exhibits a circadian oscillation in its phosphorylation levels.  the core-circadian pathway (p = 0.0006) was significantly associated to prostate cancer, for either low (p = 0.002) or high (p = 0.01) grade tumor.  here, we obtained direct evidence that clock phosphorylation may be essential for autonomous circadian oscillation in clock gene expression.  circadian clock genes have the function of producing circadian rhythm.  given that the rna interference of mushroom-body expressed (mub), the poly(rc) binding protein (pcbp) homolog of drosophila, in the clock neurons also led to a circadian phenotype in the locomotor assay, our study deemed pcbp1 a novel clock modifier whose circadian regulatory mechanism is conserved during evolution.  we investigated the expression pattern of circadian clock genes and evaluated their prognostic values in paad.  collectively, our findings first demonstrate that piwil1 negatively regulates circadian rhythms via two pathways, providing molecular connection between dysfunction of circadian rhythms and tumorigenesis.  abnormal expressions and circadian rhythm alterations of per1 are closely related to carcinogenesis.  here we report that piwil1 can suppress circadian rhythms in cancer cells.  this study determined whether the core circadian gene, clock, had a regulatory role in the development of psoriasis.  the circadian clock regulates daily variations in physiologic processes.  accumulating studies indicate that circadian clock genes are pivotal regulators of tumorigenesis and development of various cancers.  these discoveries shed new light on the role of core circadian proteins in various cellular and physiological processes.  clock acts as a regulator in the circadian apparatus controlling the expression of other clock genes, including per1.  circadian rhythms misalignment is associated with hypertension.  the cardiovascular diseases are closely related to circadian rhythm, which is under the control of the biological clock.  although it remains unclear whether this phosphorylation contributes to circadian rhythm generation, it has been suggested to be involved in transcriptional activity, intracellular localization, and degradative turnover of clock.  we aim to investigate the relationship between circadian genes polymorphisms and prostate cancer risk based on data from the epicap study, a population-based case-control study including 1,515 men (732 cases / 783 controls) with genotyped data.  the circadian clock governs our daily cycle of behavior and physiology. ||| ",Yes
Is c-met involved in the activation of the Akt pathway?,Yes,"The context suggests that c-met is involved in the activation of the Akt pathway. Upon binding of its ligand, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), c-met activates downstream pathways, including Akt. This is further supported by the mention of BMS-777607, a compound that suppresses autophosphorylated c-met and downstream c-src and Akt pathways. The context also mentions that akt is a direct target of the PI3-K, and that c-met activation can lead to the transduction of PI3-K/Akt activation signals. Therefore, it can be inferred that c-met is involved in the activation of the Akt pathway.","c-met involves in the activation of several signaling pathways, most of them are implicated in aggressive cancer phenotypes.  c-met is a receptor tyrosine kinase frequently overexpressed or amplified in many types of human cancers.  c-met is a receptor-type tyrosine kinase, which is involved in a wide range of cellular responses such as proliferation, motility, migration and invasion.  c-met is a tyrosine receptor kinase which is activated by its ligand, the hepatocyte growth factor.  c-met is abnormally activated in many tumour types.  at the molecular level, bms-777607 suppressed autophosphorylated c-met and downstream c-src and akt pathways.  in this review, we briefly summarize signaling pathways of c-met, and discuss the crystal structures of representative c-met and the binding modes with their ligands.  the receptor tyrosine kinase c-met is implicated in oncogenesis and is the target for several small molecule and biologic agents in clinical trials for the treatment of cancer.  c-met is a receptor tyrosine kinase that upon binding of its ligand, hepatocyte growth factor (hgf), activates downstream pathways with diverse cellular functions that are important in organ development and cancer progression.  activation of c-met leads to a wide spectrum of biological activities such as motility, angiogenesis, morphogenesis, cell survival and cell regeneration.  anomalous c-met signalling has been described in a variety of cancer types, and the receptor is regarded as a novel therapeutic target.  kinase activation could be due to over-expression of the normal c-met protein or to the presence of activating mutation(s).  here we describe the structural basis of c-met activation upon autophosphorylation and the selective small molecule inhibiton of autophosphorylated c-met.  aberrant c-met activation was found to induce tumour development, tumour cell migration and invasion, and the worst and final step in cancer progression, metastasis.  binding of the hepatocyte growth factor to the cell surface receptor of c-met induces activation via autophosphorylation of the kinase domain.  the c-met receptor tyrosine kinase is aberrantly activated in many solid tumors.  the same results support the hypothesis that akt is a direct target of the pi3-k and identify cytoplasmic signaling molecules that may contribute to the transduction of pi3-k/akt activation signals.  over the last two decades, much has been learnt about the functional role of c-met signalling in different models of breast development and cancer.  recent studies have demonstrated a role for the c-jun n-terminal kinase (jnk) in met-induced transformation, but little is known about the molecular mechanisms that connect met to jnk activation.  akt1, also known as protein kinase b (pkb) alpha, is frequently activated in human cancers and has been implicated in many cell processes by phosphorylation of downstream molecules. ||| ",Yes
Are reduced-nicotine cigarettes effective for smoking cessation?,Yes,"The available literature suggests that reduced-nicotine content cigarettes, in combination with nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), may facilitate smoking cessation. Evidence from several small studies indicates that reducing the nicotine content of cigarettes can decrease withdrawal symptoms, increase quit rates, and reduce the reinforcing effects of smoking. The use of reduced nicotine cigarettes (RNC) has been shown to increase the likelihood of making a quit attempt among smokers unmotivated to quit and among smokers motivated to quit who also used NRT. Additionally, RNC cigarettes have led to smoking fewer cigarettes, withdrawal relief, and facilitation of cessation. However, it is important to note that very low nicotine content cigarettes (VLNCs) may not be equally effective across heterogeneous smokers.","we reviewed the available literature on the use of reduced-nicotine content cigarettes as a cessation aid.  evidence from a number of small smoking cessation studies suggests that the use of cigarettes with reduced nicotine content, in combination with nicotine replacement therapy (nrt), may help reduce withdrawal symptoms and increase quit rates.  maximising nicotine reduction may facilitate smoking cessation.  reducing the nicotine content of cigarettes is a potential regulatory strategy that may enable cessation.  smoking cigarettes with substantially lower nicotine than conventional cigarettes prior to a quit attempt may reduce the reinforcing effects of smoking, which could facilitate smoking cessation through extinction learning.  reducing cigarette nicotine content to nonaddictive levels facilitates smoking cessation; however, very low nicotine content cigarettes (vlncs) may not be equally effective across heterogeneous smokers.  one such approach is the use of cigarettes with reduced nicotine content.  the data reviewed in this commentary suggest that abrupt reduction in the level of nicotine in combustible cigarettes could reduce smoking behavior, nicotine dependence, and other related constructs and increase quit attempts and eventual smoking cessation.  there appears to be moderate evidence that use of reduced nicotine cigarettes (rnc) increases the likelihood of making a quit attempt among smokers unmotivated to quit and among smokers motivated to quit who also used nicotine replacement therapy (nrt).  reduced nicotine content (rnc) cigarettes have led to smoking fewer cigarettes, withdrawal relief, and facilitation of cessation.  cigarettes with selective reductions in nicotine delivery have been considered as potential tools to prevent or treat nicotine dependence or to reduce harm by virtue of reduced nicotine and nitrosamine delivery.  one case series study and trial data indicate that reduction in the level of nicotine in cigarette tobacco can reduce the level of nicotine dependence in smokers and do so without adverse effects on cardiovascular biomarkers or significant compensatory smoking.  the present study investigated the effect of nicotine exposure while smoking very low nicotine content (vlnc) cigarettes on cessation outcomes.  the moderate evidence that abrupt reduction in nicotine reduces self-reported dependence as well as smoking behavior and likelihood of relapse is also reviewed.  reduction in cigarettes per day (cpd) aided by nicotine replacement therapy (nrt) increases cessation in smokers; however, it is unclear whether this is due to use of nrt or reduction per se.  these findings may have implications for smoking cessation treatment or a policy measure to reduce nicotine content in cigarettes.  a reduction in the nicotine content of cigarettes to non-addictive levels is being considered as a regulatory strategy for reducing tobacco dependence in the united states.  this paper describes the development of a smoking cessation intervention designed to optimize extinction processes using reduced nicotine cigarettes, as well as the design and methods for an ongoing randomized controlled trial (rct) to evaluate this intervention.  in smokers not interested in quitting, reducing the nicotine content in cigarettes over 12 months does not appear to result in extinction of nicotine dependence, assessed by persistently reduced nicotine intake or quitting smoking over the subsequent 12 months.  evidence suggests that reducing the nicotine concentration in cigarettes to sub-addictive levels would reduce use. ||| ",Yes
Does a linker histone exist in the yeast genome?,Yes,"The yeast genome, specifically in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, encodes a single linker histone known as Hho1p. This protein has two globular domains and shares significant homology with the single globular domains of linker histones H1 and H5 found in higher eukaryotes. Despite the lack of biochemical evidence confirming Hho1p as yeast histone H1, its role in DNA repair and regulation of chromatin structure suggests its function as a linker histone. Furthermore, genome-wide analysis has revealed an inverse correlation between linker histone occupancy and histone tail acetylation in yeast, providing insight into the regulation of chromatin structure.","in this report we describe the presence of histone h1 in yeast.  as an approach to assess linker histone function, we engineered a cdna encoding xenopus laevis histone h5 (xlh5), into the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae, which lacks any known proteins homologous to linker histones.  the existence of histone h1 in the yeast, saccharomyces cerevisiae, has long been debated.  in virtually all eukaryotic organisms, linker dna between nucleosomes is associated with a histone termed linker histone or histone h1.  saccharomyces cerevisiae encodes a single linker histone, hho1p, with two globular domains.  in saccharomyces cerevisiae, the linker histone hho1 is involved in dna repair.  biochemical studies to date have not been able to identify the linker histone h1 protein in the budding yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae.  the putative linker histone in saccharomyces cerevisiae, hho1p, has two regions of sequence (gi and gii) that are homologous to the single globular domains of linker histones h1 and h5 in higher eukaryotes.  in this study, we used a combination of genetic and genomic approaches to explore the regulation of linker histone binding in the yeast, saccharomyces cerevisiae we found that increased expression of hho1, the yeast linker histone, resulted in a severe growth defect, despite only subtle changes in chromatin structure.  here, we show in yeast, that the presence of yeast linker histone hho1p represses expression of a pol ii transcribed gene (met15) embedded in the rdna.  however, little is known about the role of the linker histone.  in saccharomyces cerevisiae, hho1 encodes a putative linker histone with very significant homology to histone h1.  collectively, these results suggest that histone acetylation negatively regulates linker histone binding in s. cerevisiae and other organisms and provide important insight into how chromatin structure is regulated and maintained to both facilitate and repress transcription.  in higher eukaryotes, multiple variants of linker histone h1 exist but their involvement in the dna damage response is unknown.  linker histones play a fundamental role in shaping chromatin structure, but how their interaction with chromatin is regulated is not well understood.  consistent with this, genome-wide analysis of linker histone occupancy revealed an inverse correlation with histone tail acetylation in both yeast and mouse embryonic stem cells.  a., and storms, r. k. (1997) yeast 13, 151-161), although there is no biochemical evidence that shows that hho1p is, indeed, yeast histone h1.  while there is indication that the budding yeast version of histone h1 (hho1) contributes to regulation of chromatin structure and certain chromatin-related processes, such as dna double-strand break repair, cells lacking hho1 are healthy and display subtle phenotypes.  ypl127c, a gene encoding a protein with a high degree of similarity to histone h1 from other species was sequenced as part of the contribution of the montreal yeast genome sequencing group to chromosome xvi.  based on these findings, we suggest that linker histone hho1p has a limited role in transcriptional regulation and that the dynamically exchanging linker histone may be evicted from chromatin by transcriptional activity. ||| ",Yes
Is Fanconi anemia presented as a genetically and clinically heterogeneous disease entity?,Yes,"Fanconi anemia is indeed presented as a genetically and clinically heterogeneous disease entity.

Is poly (ADP- ribosylation) involved in transcriptional control?,Yes,"The post-translational modification poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation (PARylation) is involved in transcriptional control. This process is mediated by the enzyme poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), which regulates the transcription of genes induced by DNA-damaging agents. PARylation of transcription factors and coregulators, such as silencer element-binding proteins, leads to their inactivation and subsequent induction of transcription of DNA repair enzymes, such as DNA polymerase beta. Furthermore, PARylation plays a role in chromatin structure and function, regulating chromatin-modifying enzymes and ultimately affecting gene expression. The synthesis of poly(ADP-ribose) can be modulated by the interaction of substances with the DNA binding site of PARP, and PARP-1 may modulate gene expression through its catalytic activity or physical association with relevant proteins. The regulation of ADP-ribosylation is vital for maintaining genomic integrity, and uncontrolled accumulation of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation can trigger cell death.","the results of recent studies demonstrate that adp-ribosylation contributes to transcription regulation.  poly(adp-ribosyl)ation is involved in the regulation of a variety of cellular pathways, including, but not limited to, transcription, chromatin, dna damage and other stress signalling.  poly(adp-ribosylation) is a post-translational modification playing a relevant role in dna damage recovery, dna replication and viral integration.  poly(adp-ribosyl)ation of transcription factors and coregulators, mediated by the poly(adp-ribose) polymerase parp-1, has been emerging as an important epigenetic mechanism that controls transcriptional dynamics in response to diverse intra- and extracellular signals.  adp-ribosylation of nuclear proteins, catalysed by the enzyme poly(adp-ribose) polymerase, is involved in the regulation of different cellular processes of dna metabolism.  the function of poly(adp-ribose) is not clear, although it has been suggested to be involved in the regulation of dna transactions such as replication, repair, and transcription.  posttranslational modifications, such as poly(adp-ribosyl)ation (parylation), regulate chromatin-modifying enzymes, ultimately affecting gene expression.  adp-ribosylation has been implicated in a wide variety of cellular processes including cell growth and differentiation, apoptosis and transcriptional regulation.  the post-translational modification poly(adp-ribosyl)ation (parylation) plays key roles in genome maintenance and transcription.  poly(adp-ribose)-polymerase is an important cellular regulatory enzyme which can change chromatin structure and function.  in this model, poly(adp-ribose) polymerase regulates transcription of genes that are induced by dna-damaging agents.  adp-ribosylation is a reversible posttranslational modification mediated by poly-adp-ribose polymerase (parp).  this transcriptional regulation results from poly(adp-ribosyl)ation and inactivation of dna sequence-specific regulatory proteins such as silencer element-binding proteins, thereby inducing transcription of dna polymerase beta, which is a dna repair enzyme in higher eukaryotes.  adp-ribosylation is a reversible and site-specific post-translational modification that regulates a wide array of cellular signaling pathways.  poly(adp-ribosyl)ation plays a major role in dna repair, where it regulates chromatin relaxation as one of the critical events in the repair process.  accumulating evidence suggests an important role for the enzyme poly(adp-ribose) polymerase-1 (parp-1) as an integral part of the gene expression regulatory machinery during development and in response to specific cellular signals.  the synthesis of poly(adp-ribose) can be modulated by interaction of substances with the dna binding site of the poly(adp-ribose)-polymerase.  parp-1 might modulate gene expression through its catalytic activity leading to poly(adp-ribosyl)ation of nuclear proteins or by its physical association with relevant proteins.  studies on poly(adp-ribosyl)ation related to chromatin structure and to nuclear functions such as repair, gene expression and replication are reviewed.  regulation of adp-ribosylation is vital for maintaining genomic integrity, and uncontrolled accumulation of poly(adp-ribosyl)ation triggers a poly(adp-ribose) (par)-dependent release of apoptosis-inducing factor from mitochondria, leading to cell death. ||| ",Yes
Is invasion and metastasis one of the hallmarks of cancer?,Yes,"Invasion and metastasis are indeed hallmarks of cancer. The defining characteristic of cancer malignancy is the invasion of tumor cells into adjacent tissues, which is the first step towards metastasis. This process is governed by different cellular mechanisms than those driving the deregulated growth of tumors. The development of metastases is the major cause of death for cancer patients, although the mechanisms of tumor invasion and acquisition of capability to metastasize remain unclear. Tumor invasion is a complex, multi-step biochemical process that involves cell detachment, invasion, migration, intravasation and circulation, implantation, angiogenesis and proliferation. The ability to invade tissue is one of the hallmarks of cancer, and it is a prerequisite for distant metastasis. The mortality associated with cancer depends upon the ability of malignant cells to invade and metastasize into adjacent and distant regions. A better understanding of the complex processes involved in cancer invasion may ultimately lead to treatments being developed which can localize cancer and prevent metastasis.","invasion and metastasis are hallmarks of cancer.  a defining characteristic of cancer malignancy is invasion and metastasis.  invasion, or directed migration of tumor cells into adjacent tissues, is one of the hallmarks of cancer and the first step towards metastasis.  cancer invasion and metastasis is the most morbid aspect of cancer and is governed by different cellular mechanisms than those driving the deregulated growth of tumors.  the development of metastases is the major cause of death for cancer patients, however, the mechanisms of tumor invasion and acquisition of capability to metastasize remain unclear.  tumor invasion is paradigmatic of the complex interactions connecting a carcinoma with its environment, and a reflex of the cellular and molecular heterogeneity that defines the initiation of dissemination and metastasis.  invasion and metastasis, the hallmark of malignant tumor, is the main reason for the clinical death of most cancer patients.  tumor invasion and metastasis are complex, multi-step biochemical processes, which involve cell detachment, invasion, migration, intravasation and circulation, implantation, angiogenesis and proliferation.  invasion, the hallmark of malignancy, consists in the translocation of tumour cells from the initial neoplastic focus into neighbouring host tissues, and also allows tumour cells to penetrate vessel endothelium and enter the circulation to form distant metastasis.  although tumor invasion and metastasis are both classical hallmarks of cancer malignancy and the major causes of poor clinical outcomes among cancer patients, the underlying master regulators of invasion and metastasis remain largely unknown.  the ability to invade tissue is one of the hallmarks of cancer.  invasion of tissue by the cancer cells is one of the key components in the metastatic cascade, whereby cancer cells spread to distant parts of the host and initiate the growth of secondary tumours (metastases).  the mortality associated with cancer depends upon the ability of malignant cells to invade and metastasise into adjacent and distant regions.  cancer cell motility and invasion are crucial elements in the metastatic cascade and involve dramatic changes in cellular morphology that are associated with dynamic remodelling of the cytoskeleton.  cancer cell invasion takes place at the cancer-host interface and is a prerequisite for distant metastasis.  a better understanding of the complex processes involved in cancer invasion may ultimately lead to treatments being developed which can localise cancer and prevent metastasis.  metastasis is the hallmark of cancer that is responsible for the greatest number of cancer-related deaths.  metastasis, a leading contributor to the morbidity of cancer patients, occurs through a multi-step process: invasion, intravasation, extravasation, colonization, and metastatic tumor formation.  cancer invasion and metastasis are the leading causes of death.  the acquisition of invasive tumour cell behaviour is thought to be a cornerstone of the metastatic cascade. ||| ",Yes
Is HER2 active only when it dimerizes?,No,"The human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2) is a tyrosine kinase family protein receptor that undergoes heterodimerization with other members of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family for cell signaling. The dimerization of HER2 leads to the autophosphorylation of tyrosine residues within its cytoplasmic domain, resulting in hyperactivation of several downstream signal transduction pathways that play an important role in tumorigenesis, cancer aggressiveness, and cell proliferation. However, HER2 molecules can undergo spontaneous dimerization, autophosphorylation, and activation of downstream signaling pathways, especially under conditions of overexpression, a commonly encountered phenomenon in breast cancer. This indicates that HER2 can be active without dimerization, although dimerization enhances its activity.","although it is known that her2 dimerization involves a specific region of its extracellular domain, the so-called ""dimerization arm"", the mechanism of dimerization inhibition remains uncertain.  the dimerization of her2 leads to the autophosphorylation of tyrosine residues within its cytoplasmic domain, resulting in hyperactivation of several downstream signal transduction pathways that play an important role in tumorigenesis, cancer aggressiveness and cell proliferation.  hence, her2 molecules can undergo spontaneous dimerization, autophosphorylation and activation of downstream signaling pathways especially under conditions of overexpression, a commonly encountered phenomenon in breast cancer.  this paper is aimed to describe consequences of possible dimerization modes between ligand binding her1 and ligand free her2 receptors on cellular membrane.  our results support and advance the knowledge on the already described trastuzumab effect on blocking her2 dimerization through synergistic inhibition and/or steric hindrance.  in this study, we sought to investigate the mechanism by which her2 musters signaling and transformation potency.  however, uncovering how antibody interactions lead to inhibition of her2 dimerization is of key importance in understanding its role in tumour progression and therapy.  human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (her2) is a tyrosine kinase family protein receptor that is known to undergo heterodimerization with other members of the family of epidermal growth factor receptors (egfr) for cell signaling.  in a broad range of human carcinomas gene amplification leads to her2 overexpression, which has been proposed to cause spontaneous dimerization and activation in the absence of ligand.  this makes her2 attractive as a therapeutic target.  conformational changes in the her2 activation loop, as measured by changes in carboxyl group labeling, required both dimerization and nucleotide binding but did not require activation loop phosphorylation at tyr-877.  human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (her2) is a member of the epidermal growth factor receptor (her) family that is involved in various biological processes such as cell proliferation, survival, differentiation, migration and invasion.  ligand-dependent heterodimerization between her2 and another her family member, her1, her3 or her4, activates the her2 signaling pathway.  in normal biological systems, her2 functions as a co-receptor for a multitude of epidermal growth factor-like ligands that bind and activate other her family members.  in tumors, high expression of her2 can lead to many her2:her2 homodimers and increased cell growth that contributes to a poor prognosis.  we have detected the her2 extracellular domain homodimer in solution.  cells with her2/neu molecules on their surface can react to moderate or even low her1 ligand exposure through formation of her2:her1-ligand dimers, making them more sensitive to growth stimulation by egf or other ligands without the ""all or none"" threshold in cell growth stimulation.  these findings indicate that her2 is an appropriate target for tumor-specific therapies.  under physiologic levels of expression, her2 heterodimerizes with other members of the egf receptor/her/erbb family, and the her2-her3 dimer forms one of the most potent oncogenic receptor pairs.  the heterodimerization of egfr with her2 induces a more potent activation of egfr tk than does egfr homodimerization. ||| ",Yes
Is there a relation between ANP and transcapillary albumin escape?,Yes,"The infusion of Atrial Natriuretic Peptide (ANP) has been shown to significantly increase the transcapillary escape rate of intravascular albumin, as compared to a saline control. This effect was observed in various organs, including the gastrointestinal tract, skeletal muscle, heart, and lungs. The increase in albumin escape rate is likely a secondary phenomenon resulting from the shift of plasma water and electrolytes from the circulation induced by ANP. Furthermore, ANP has been found to enhance the escape of radiolabeled albumin. These findings suggest a direct relationship between ANP and transcapillary albumin escape.","transcapillary escape rate of intravascular albumin when corrected for concurrent plasma volume changes showed a significantly greater escape during anp infusion than during saline control (p < 0.05).  the transvascular escape rate (ter) of labeled albumin is reported to increase in essential hypertension.  we studied the effect of low dose anp (2.5 pmol/kg.min) or equal volume of saline control when infused over 90 min, on plasma volume, transcapillary escape rate of intravascular albumin, and the rate of reentry of albumin to the vascular space in eight normal subjects.  this study was aimed at determining the specific organs in which anf increases the escape of albumin.  this study was undertaken to determine whether atrial natriuretic peptide (anp) may play a role in the escape phenomenon.  therefore, the rise in albuminuria during anp infusion most likely reflects alterations in glomerular permeability.  anf increased the rate at which 125i-albumin escaped from the overall circulation at infusion rates of 0.1 and 0.5 micrograms.min-1.kg-1.  at an anf infusion rate of 0.1 micrograms.min-1.kg-1, the albumin escape rate increased in the gastrointestinal tract, skeletal muscle, heart, and lungs.  in summary, low dose anp infusion in healthy subjects caused a shift of plasma water and electrolytes from the circulation, with albumin escape as a secondary phenomenon.  the free form of anp was inversely correlated with the daily urinary sodium excretion (r = -0.71, p less than 0.001) and plasma albumin (r = -0.83, p less than 0.001), and positively correlated with the daily urinary protein excretion (r = -0.85, p less than 0.001) in both control and nephrotic groups.  an increase in albumin excretion has traditionally been considered to reflect a 'glomerular' leak of protein; however, it is now recognized that significant tubular reabsorption of albumin occurs under physiological conditions that may be modified by genetic determinants, systemic disease and drug therapies.  after infusion of anp dissolved in haemaccel urinary beta2-m excretion increased from 0.05 +/- 0.03 microg min(-1) to 27 +/- 10 microg min(-1) and urinary albumin excretion increased from 4.5 +/- 1.1 microg min(-1) to 9.7 +/- 6.3 microg min(-1) (p<0.05).  the currently defined mechanisms underpinning the tubular reabsorption of albumin, how these are modified by pathology and pharmacology, and the clinical implications are the subject of this review.  atrial natriuretic factor (anf) causes plasma fluid to shift out of the circulation and enhances the escape of radiolabeled albumin.  during anp + saline infusion, urinary beta2-m excretion did not change, whereas the urinary albumin excretion increased from 5.3 +/- 1.5 microg min(-1) to 7.9 +/- 2.4 microg min(-1) (p<0.05).  this is the second of two studies of the influence of perfusate albumin composition on ap alterations in capillary lp.  in the first series of studies, infusion of anp resulted in a significant natriuresis, diuresis, and increase in inulin clearance and in a slight fall in systemic arterial pressure, as compared to vehicle infusion.  there is also mounting evidence for a transcytotic pathway for retrieval of albumin from the tubular filtrate.  in conclusion, 1) anp infusion induced a sustained natriuresis and transient diuresis; 2) there were no changes in the subcellular localization of aqp2 and enac subunits after 10 min of anp infusion; and 3) there was a marked increase in apical targeting of aqp2, p-aqp2, and alpha- and gamma-enac after 90 min of anp infusion.  we conclude that small hydrophilic albumin-associated substances antagonize ap- and snp-induced elevations of exchange microvessel hydraulic conductance without interfering with albumin's role in the maintenance of normal exchange vessel permeability. ||| ",Yes
Are piRNAs involved in gene silencing?,Yes,"Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) are indeed involved in gene silencing. They are a type of small non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) that play a crucial role in silencing genomic transposable elements, thereby maintaining genome integrity during germline development. The piRNA-Piwi complexes are transported into the nucleus to exert this silencing effect. Furthermore, piRNAs have been found to regulate various endogenous transcripts, demonstrating their role in post-transcriptional gene silencing. This process is a part of the broader RNA interference (RNAi) mechanism, which is a strong gene silencing mechanism in eukaryotes, moderated by small RNAs such as piRNAs, microRNAs (miRNAs), and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs).","small silencing rnas, including micrornas, endogenous small interfering rnas (endo-sirnas) and piwi-interacting rnas (pirnas), have been shown to play important roles in fine-tuning gene expression, defending virus and controlling transposons.  piwi-interacting rnas (pirnas) are germline-specific, small silencing rnas that suppress te activity and maintain genome integrity during germline development.  small interfering rnas (sirnas) and micrornas (mirnas) are key regulators of posttranscriptional gene silencing, which is referred to as rna interference (rnai) or rna silencing.  rna interference pathways use small rnas to mediate gene silencing in eukaryotes.  piwi-interacting rnas (pirnas) are the small non-coding rnas (ncrnas) that silence genomic transposable elements.  small silencing rnas--small interfering rnas (sirnas) or micrornas (mirnas)--direct posttranscriptional gene silencing of their mrna targets as guides for the rna-induced silencing complex (risc).  small rnas, including small interfering rnas (sirnas), micrornas (mirnas) and piwi-associated interfering rnas (pirnas), are powerful gene expression regulators.  rna interference (rnai) or post-transcriptional gene silencing is a strong mechanism of gene silencing which is moderated by micrornas (mirnas), underlying many fields of eukaryotic biology.  rna silencing refers to a series of nuclear and cytoplasmatic processes involved in the post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression or post-transcriptional gene silencing (ptgs), either by sequence-specific mrna degradation or by translational arrest.  rna silencing also plays an important role in the control of development.  and researchers found out that pirna also regulates various endogenous transcripts.  the piwi-pirna complexes are then transported into the nucleus to exert te silencing.  rna silencing pathways are now recognized to participate in essential cellular functions ranging from the regulation of mrna turnover to the suppression of the activity of potentially deleterious transposable elements (tes).  the best characterized small rnas are micrornas (mirnas), which predominantly perform gene silencing through post-transcriptional mechanisms.  the piwi-interacting rnas (pirnas) represent a germline-specific small rna pathway where piwi proteins themselves are thought to mediate pirna biosynthesis.  in plants, rna silencing serves as a potent antiviral defense system.  loss of small silencing rnas or components in their pathways often leads to severe developmental defects, including lethality and sterility.  small rnas exert an effect through diverse rna interference pathways to transcriptionally or post-transcriptionally silence their targets.  by directing the rna-induced silencing complex (risc) to bind specific target mrnas, mirna can repress target genes and affect various biological phenotypes.  in rnai, sirna loaded onto the rna-induced silencing complex (risc) downreugulates target gene expression by cleaving mrna whose sequence is perfectly complementary to the sirna guide strand. ||| ",Yes
Does MVIIA and MVIIC bind to the same calcium channel?,No,"The context indicates that MVIIA and MVIIC selectively block n- and p/q-type calcium channels, respectively. This suggests that these two toxins do not bind to the same calcium channel. The binding assay for both n- and p/q-type calcium channels further supports this, as it shows that the amino acid residues important for the recognition of n-type channels are restricted to the n-terminal half, while those for p/q-type channel recognition are widely spread over the whole omega-conotoxin molecule.","here, we have examined the action of mviia on mutant and wild type calcium channels transiently expressed in tsa-201 cells.  at higher concentrations (approximately 3 microm), mviia reversibly blocked l-, p/q-, and r-type, but not t-type channels, indicating that the overall architecture of the mviia site is conserved in all types of high voltage-activated calcium channels.  these channels, however, seem to possess binding sites for omega-conotoxins mviic and mviid whose characteristics differ considerably from those described to occur in the brain; they might represent a subset of q-type ca2+ channels or an entirely new subtype of voltage-dependent high-threshold ca2+ channel.  we propose a model in which n-type calcium channels can form both reversible and irreversible complexes with mviia.  omega-conotoxin mviic binds to p/q-type calcium channels with high affinity and n-type channels with low affinity.  despite their high sequence homology, the peptide neurotoxins omega-conotoxin mviia and mviic selectively block n- and p/q-type calcium channels, respectively.  to study the recognition mechanism of calcium channel subtypes, two chimeric analogs of omega-conotoxin mviia and mviic were synthesized by exchanging their n- and c-terminal halves.  a kinetic analysis of the mviia effects on the n-type channel showed that mviia blocked resting, open, and inactivated channels.  recent reports have suggested that different types of ca(2+)-activated k(+) channels may be selectively expressed either in the vascular endothelial cells (ecs) or smooth muscle cells (smcs) of a single artery.  similar to the previously reported action of omega-conopeptide gvia, omega-conopeptide mviia irreversibly blocks imr32 hva calcium channel currents at low concentrations.  these results suggest that mviic interacts with p/q-type channels via a large surface, in good agreement with previous observations using chimeric analogs.  in the distinctive effects of atp, gtp, and zn2+ on the ca2+ channel activity observed in both the mv and the liposome systems, the common factor was the presence of annexin v. from this we conclude that ca2+ entry into mv results from the presence of annexin v in these membrane-enclosed structures.  voltage-dependent calcium (ca(2+), ca(v)1.2) channels are the primary ca(2+) entry pathway in smooth muscle cells of resistance-size (myogenic) arteries, but their molecular identity remains unclear.  this entry pathway was found to be independent of dihydropyridine-sensitive ca2+ channels and inhibited by increased external mg2+ concentration.  these data strengthen the previously established conclusion that q-type ca2+ channels that contribute to the regulation of secretion and are sensitive to omega-conotoxins mviic and mviid are present in bovine chromaffin cells.  these findings indicate a cell-specific distribution of ca(2+)-activated k(+) channels in smcs and ecs from a single arterial site.  these results suggest that voltage-dependent facilitation of the ca(v)1.2 channel depends on the phosphorylation of ser1512/ser1570 by calmodulin kinase ii.  the precipitated ca(v)1.2 channel was phosphorylated in the presence of calmodulin and ca2+.  calcium-dependent facilitation of l-type calcium channels has been reported to depend on the function of calmodulin kinase ii.  binding assay for both n- and p/q-type calcium channels showed that amino acid residues restricted to the n-terminal half are important for the recognition of n-type channels, whereas essential residues for p/q-type channel recognition are widely spread over the whole omega-conotoxin molecule. ||| ",No
Is the ACE inhibitor indicated for lung cancer treatment?,No,"The ACE inhibitor is not indicated for lung cancer treatment.

However, this does not necessarily indicate that ACE inhibitors are effective in treating lung cancer. In fact, the context suggests that the use of ACE inhibitors may be associated with an increased incidence of lung cancer, although this is not definitive. Therefore, based on the available evidence, it cannot be concluded that ACE inhibitors are indicated for the treatment of lung cancer.","because of contradictory evidence from clinical trials, the association between angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (aceis) and lung cancer needs further evaluation.  statistical significant lung cancer signals were detected among patients who received acei, especially female patients.  the angiotensin converting enzyme (ace) inhibitors are used widely as antihypertensive agents, and it has been suggested that they decrease the risk of some cancers, although available data are conflicting.  this study is conducted to compare the incidence of lung cancers in patients on aceis and arbs.  results of the carefully executed evaluation of treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and the risk of lung cancer (eracer) study, reported in this issue, echo those of several previous observational analyses of the association of long-term angiotensin-converting enzyme (ace) inhibitor use with incident lung cancer.  in the postmatch group, prescription of ace inhibitor was associated with a significant decrease in the risk of 5-year mortality (hazard ratio 0.61, 95% confidence interval 0.43 to 0.87, p = 0.006).  second, confounding by indication is possible because until 2013, ace inhibitors, not arbs, were first-line medications for heart failure, which is associated with incident lung cancer.  to analyze the association of the use of different doses of angiotensin ii receptor blockers (arb) and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (acei) independently with lung cancer risk and to evaluate the lung cancer type that may be related to arb or acei use.  therefore, our aim was to evaluate the prognostic impact of ace inhibitor in patients with dhf.  we conducted a disproportionality analysis of primary malignant lung cancer adverse events associated with 10 aceis by calculating the reported odds ratios (ror) and information component (ic) with 95% confidence intervals (ci).  in view of these experimental findings, we conclude that captopril could be a promising option for the treatment of lung cancer.  in this study, the incidence of lung cancer was relatively more among people using aceis than arbs.  in adjusted analysis, significantly better survival was observed for patients treated with acei/arb (3-year hazard ratio: 0.80; 95% confidence interval: 0.77 to 0.83).  the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ace) inhibitor has a well defined place in the treatment of systolic heart failure (hf).  on multivariable cox analysis, the relation between ace inhibitor prescription and mortality remained significant (hazard ratio 0.73, 95% confidence interval 0.54 to 0.99, p = 0.045).  ace inhibitor therapy prescribed at discharge in 46% (n = 165) of the 358 included patients was associated with a 30% relative decrease in the risk of 5-year mortality (hazard ratio 0.70, 95% confidence interval 0.53 to 0.93, p = 0.013).  serum angiotensin-converting enzyme (ace) and aldosterone levels of non-small-cell lung cancer patients treated with chemotherapy with or without cediranib were evaluated.  the long-term use of angiotensin converting enzyme (ace) inhibitors may reduce the risk of developing colorectal cancer (crc).  we assessed the long-term prognosis of these patients according to prescription of an ace inhibitor at discharge.  in conclusion, we demonstrate that in this cohort of patients with dhf, prescription of ace inhibitor was associated with a significant decrease in long-term mortality. ||| ",No

Has Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency an X-linked inheritance?,Yes,"Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is indeed an X-linked hereditary disorder, as confirmed by multiple sources. The G6PD gene, responsible for encoding the G6PD enzyme, is located on the X chromosome. This disorder is characterized by abnormally low levels of the G6PD enzyme, which is caused by one or more mutations in the G6PD gene. The deficiency is inherited in an X-linked recessive manner, predominantly affecting males. Females, however, can exhibit a range of G6PD deficiencies due to random X-chromosome inactivation.

Is there a phylogenetic analysis for HIV?,Yes,"Phylogenetic analysis is indeed utilized in HIV research. This method, which involves the study of genetic relatedness between HIV strains, has been employed to understand critical aspects of the HIV epidemic. It has been used to examine HIV transmission patterns among and within risk groups, as well as to assess how HIV spreads in populations. The growth of HIV sequence databases has further motivated the use of phylogenetic methods in this field. The accuracy of these methods has been established, and they have been used to clarify transmission patterns of HIV-1. Phylogenetic tools have also been adapted for estimating epidemiological quantities of importance to HIV-1 prevention in sub-Saharan Africa.","phylogenetics is an important tool for hiv research, and offers opportunities to understand critical aspects of the hiv epidemic.  the purpose of this review is to highlight the current utilities and limitations of phylogenetics in hiv epidemiological research from sample collection through to data analysis.  to discuss the recent hiv phylogenetic analyses examining hiv transmission patterns among and within risk groups.  phylogenetics is frequently used for studies of population-based hiv transmission.  phylogenetic methods are being increasingly used to help understand the transmission dynamics of measurably evolving viruses, including hiv.  the growth of human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) sequence databases resulting from drug resistance testing has motivated efforts using phylogenetic methods to assess how hiv spreads1-4.  these results highlight the importance of comparative hiv evolutionary studies in immunologically different populations worldwide.  viral phylogenetic methods contribute to understanding how hiv spreads in populations, and thereby help guide the design of prevention interventions.  here, we show that viral phylogenetic tools can be adapted and used to estimate epidemiological quantities of central importance to hiv-1 prevention in sub-saharan africa.  knowledge of the phylogenetic history of the human immunodeficiency viruses (hiv-1 and hiv-2) is important for our understanding of the epidemiology of aids, the disease caused by these viruses.  phylogenetic analysis - the study of the genetic relatedness between hiv strains - has recently been used in criminal prosecutions as evidence of responsibility for hiv transmission.  this complex, known hiv-1 transmission history was compared with reconstructed molecular trees, which were calculated from the dna sequences by several commonly used phylogenetic inference methods .  phylogenetic analyses are increasingly used in attempts to clarify transmission patterns of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1), but there is a continuing discussion about their validity because convergent evolution and transmission of minor hiv variants may obscure epidemiological patterns.  thus, our results establish how to interpret phylogenetic trees based on hiv sequences when tracking who-infected-whom, when and how genetic information can be used for improved tracking of hiv spread.  the accuracy of the phylogenetic methods justifies their use in hiv-1 research and argues against convergent evolution and selective transmission of certain virus variants.  here, we address this issue by investigating phylogenetic patterns from 272 previously identified hiv transmission chains with 955 transmission pairs representing diverse geography, risk groups, subtypes, and genomic regions.  phylogenetic analysis has been widely used to test the a priori hypothesis of epidemiological clustering in suspected transmission chains of hiv-1.  the phylogenetic relationship between the hiv populations of epidemiologically linked hosts can be classified into six types of trees, based on cladistic relationships and whether the reconstruction is consistent with the true transmission history or not.  we show that the resulting phylogeny inferred from real hiv genetic sequences indeed reveals distinct patterns associated with direct transmission contra transmissions from a common source.  to direct the use of phylogenetic tools to where the impact of hiv-1 is greatest, the phylogenetics and networks for generalized hiv epidemics in africa (pangea-hiv) consortium generates full-genome viral sequences from across sub-saharan africa. ||| ",Yes
Does the 3D structure of  the genome remain stable during cell differentiation?,No,"The 3D structure of the genome does not remain stable during cell differentiation. Instead, it varies with cell types, developmental stages, and environmental conditions. The genome of a higher eukaryotic organism is organized into distinct three-dimensional structures, each characteristic for a given differentiated state. These structures are envisioned to develop in a hierarchical and largely irreversible manner from an omnipotent 3D structure of the zygotic genome. The dynamic three-dimensional chromatin architecture of genomes is a key feature of genomic function, but it remains to be properly understood. The regulation of proteins, their interaction with DNA, and their co-occurrence in the genome, may be responsible for the plasticity of 3D chromatin architecture that dictates cell and time-specific blueprints of gene expression.","the 3d structure of the genome plays a key role in regulatory control of the cell.  three-dimensional (3d) genome structures vary from cell to cell even in an isogenic sample.  the three-dimensional (3d) structure of the genome is important for orchestration of gene expression and cell differentiation.  the eukaryotic genome adopts in the cell nucleus a 3-dimensional configuration that varies with cell types, developmental stages and environmental condition as well as between normal and pathological states.  it is assumed that the genome of a higher eukaryotic organism is organized into a number of distinct three-dimensional (3-d) structures, each characteristic for a given differentiated state.  in this review, we focus on the physical nature of the 3d genome architecture.  however, how the 3d genome organization and its dynamics influence cellular phenotypes remains poorly understood.  the three-dimensional (3d) organization of the genome is intimately related to numerous key biological functions including gene expression and dna replication regulations.  the three-dimensional (3d) genome organization and its role in biological activities have been investigated for over a decade in the field of cell biology.  here, we discuss the current state of studies of 3d genome folding and the relation of this folding to the functional organization of the genome.  these discrete 3-d structures are envisioned to develop in a hierarchical and largely irreversible manner from an omnipotent 3-d structure of the zygotic genome.  the three-dimensional organization of chromatin is expected to play critical roles in regulating genome functions.  the observation in many species that 3d domains correlate strongly with the 1d epigenomic information along the genome suggests a dynamic coupling between chromatin organization and epigenetic regulation.  the 3d organization of the genome facilitates gene regulation, replication, and repair, making it a key feature of genomic function and one that remains to be properly understood.  the regulation of these proteins, their interaction with dna, and their co-occurrence in the genome, may be responsible for the plasticity of 3d chromatin architecture that dictates cell and time-specific blueprints of gene expression.  the mechanisms by which molecular drivers functionally organize the 3d genome, such as topologically associating domains (tads), remain to be explored.  here, we discuss the evolution of 3c-based technologies for mapping 3d genome organization.  by applying these methods to real hi-c data, we highlighted a temporal hierarchy embedded in the 3d genome organization; chromatin interaction boundaries are more rigid than the boundary interior, while functional domains emerge as dynamic fluctuations within a particular time interval.  the dynamic three-dimensional chromatin architecture of genomes and its co-evolutionary connection to its function-the storage, expression, and replication of genetic information-is still one of the central issues in biology.  the genome of pluripotent stem cells adopts a unique three-dimensional architecture featuring weakly condensed heterochromatin and large nucleosome-free regions. ||| ",No
Is there evidence for de novo genesis of enhancers in vertebrates?,Yes,"The study provides evidence for the de novo genesis of enhancers in vertebrates, specifically in fish. The identified enhancers, which have homologous function and are likely derived from a common ancestral sequence, have not been previously demonstrated to be generated from non-regulatory/non-mobile sequences. Approximately 20% of these enhancers arose in the mammalian stem lineage, coinciding with the emergence of the neocortex. The results indicate that selection on function, rather than sequence, may be a common mode of enhancer evolution. The study also highlights that minor changes in non-regulatory sequences can generate new enhancers, creating new regulatory variability and evolutionary innovation.","here we show evidence for the de novo genesis of enhancers in vertebrates.  to examine the contributions of sequence and function conservation in the evolution of enhancers, we systematically identified enhancers whose sequences are not conserved among distant groups of vertebrate species, but have homologous function and are likely to be derived from a common ancestral sequence.  these results demonstrate that these enhancers have been de novo generated in fish.  while a growing body of evidence demonstrates that such innovation is generated by functional changes or translocation of regulatory elements via mobile genetic elements, the de novo generation of enhancers from non-regulatory/non-mobile sequences has, to our knowledge, not previously been demonstrated.  we infer the phylogenetic origins of these enhancers and find that ∼20% arose in the mammalian stem lineage, coincident with the emergence of the neocortex.  vertebrate enhancers are often very highly conserved in their sequences, and relative positions, across distantly related taxa.  these results show that current models depicting cross species enhancer function as dependent on conserved binding sites can be overly simplistic, with sound evolutionary inference requiring detailed dissection of underlying mechanisms.  these results indicate that selection on function, rather than sequence, may be a common mode of enhancer evolution; evidence for selection at the sequence level is not a necessary criterion to define a gene regulatory element.  we propose that the different degree of conservation seen in vertebrate and drosophila enhancers may be explained solely by differences in their population sizes and generation times.  by revealing that minor changes in non-regulatory sequences are sufficient to generate new enhancers, our study highlights an important playground for creating new regulatory variability and evolutionary innovation.  comparisons between diverse vertebrate genomes have uncovered thousands of highly conserved non-coding sequences, an increasing number of which have been shown to function as enhancers during early development.  our approach combined comparative genomics and epigenomics to identify potential enhancer sequences in the genomes of three groups of distantly related vertebrate species.  based on these observations, we present a model of the enhancer life cycle in which neocortical enhancers initially emerge from genomic background as short, weakly constrained ""proto-enhancers.""  large-scale gene amplifications may have facilitated the evolution of morphological innovations that accompanied the origin of vertebrates.  we have identified numerous potential enhancers with divergent sequences but a conserved function.  enhancers regulate precise spatial and temporal patterns of gene expression in eukaryotes and, moreover, evolutionary changes in these modular cis-regulatory elements may represent the predominant genetic basis for phenotypic evolution.  the nucleotide sequence of the early enhancer region is extremely conserved among mammalian clades, with five previously described cis-acting elements, a-e, being invariant.  vertebrate genomes share numerous conserved non-coding elements, many of which function as enhancer elements and are hypothesised to be under evolutionary constraint due to a need to be bound by combinations of sequence-specific transcription factors.  the origin of vertebrate embryogenesis must have involved the evolution of new regulatory pathways to control the development of new features, but how did this occur?  nevertheless, we show that at least 31% of the redundant enhancer pairs in the human genome (and 17% in the mouse genome) indeed originated in this manner. ||| ",Yes
Is cocaine use associated with increased risk for intracerebral hemorrhage?,Yes,"Cocaine use has been identified as a significant risk factor for intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). This association is supported by evidence that cocaine is a cause of ICH, with recent ingestion linked to hemorrhages occurring more frequently in subcortical locations and having a higher risk of intraventricular hemorrhage. Cocaine abuse has also been reported to be associated with an increased frequency of hemorrhagic or ischemic stroke. The relationship between severe cocaine-induced hypertension and the development of subarachnoid or intracerebral hemorrhages is noted, and is believed to be related to sudden transient increases of blood pressure related to cocaine use. Cocaine is a known vasoactive drug associated with poor clinical outcomes and high in-hospital mortality related to aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. Although the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood, the evidence suggests that cocaine use is associated with an increased risk for intracerebral hemorrhage.","these findings implicate cocaine use as a significant risk factor for fatal brain hemorrhage and may explain, in part, the increased incidence of hemorrhagic stroke in some drug-using cohorts.  cocaine is a cause of intracerebral hemorrhage (ich), but there are no large studies that have characterized the location, pathology, and outcome of patients with cocaine-associated ich.  recent cocaine ingestion is associated with hemorrhages that occur more frequently in subcortical locations, have a higher risk of intraventricular hemorrhage, and have a poor prognosis compared to patients with cocaine-negative, spontaneous ich.  cocaine abuse has been reported to be associated with an increased frequency of hemorrhagic or ischemic stroke.  to determine the incidence of cocaine abuse in cases of fatal intracranial hemorrhage and to examine potential pathophysiologic mechanisms.  cocaine use has been temporally associated with neurovascular complications, including the rupture of intracerebral aneurysms.  intracerebral hemorrhage (ich) is a well-recognized complication of recreational cocaine use.  these results may be relevant to an increased frequency of cerebrovascular accidents in cocaine-abusing individuals.  whereas we found no evidence that chronic cocaine use is a risk factor for caa, given the age-associated nature of caa and the aging population using cocaine, caa-induced hemorrhage in the setting of cocaine use may be more common than recognized.  nine cases of intracranial hemorrhages related to cocaine usage are presented.  the relationship between severe cocaine-induced hypertension, and the development of subarachnoid or intracerebral hemorrhages is noted, and apparently is related to sudden transient increases of blood pressure related to cocaine use.  it is now believed cocaine use may lead to subarachnoid hemorrhage.  cocaine is a known vasoactive drug associated with poor clinical outcomes and high in-hospital mortality related to aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage; however, the association of prior cocaine use with the incidence of vasospasm and delayed cerebral ischemia remains controversial.  intracerebral hemorrhage has been reported as a cocaine-related complication, but has not previously been associated with pregnancy.  we report a case of cocaine-associated intracerebral hemorrhage in the postpartum period which complicated the differential diagnosis and management of hypertension and seizures.  cocaine use is associated with a variety of serious neurological complications, including cerebral infarction, intracerebral and subarachnoid hemorrhage, transient ischemic attacks, migraines, and seizures.  cocaine is a widespread recreational drug that has the potential to induce neurological vascular diseases, including ischaemic and haemorrhagic stroke.  although cocaine abuse has been associated with an increased incidence of cerebrovascular accident, the underlying mechanisms are unknown.  the purpose of the current study was to determine the type of neurovascular complications associated with cocaine use in our patient population, the temporal relationship between cocaine use and their onset, and whether cocaine users with subarachnoid hemorrhage (sah) presented with smaller aneurysms at an earlier age than a control group of noncocaine users with sah.  we review the current literature on the association of cocaine use with the incidence of vasospasm and delayed cerebral ischemia as well as the effects of cocaine on the cerebrovasculature. ||| ",Yes
Is protein CXCR4 used as a prognostic marker of cancer?,Yes,"The protein CXCR4 has been identified as a potential prognostic marker in various types of cancer, including colorectal cancer, clear-cell renal cell carcinoma, breast cancer, and gastric cancer. The expression of CXCR4, particularly in whole cells and cytoplasm, has been associated with poor prognosis in patients with breast cancer. High expression of CXCR4 has been significantly associated with a favorable prognosis in a test and validation group. The role of CXCR4 in cancer is dependent on its activation and signaling state. The expression and prognostic significance of CXCR4 have been investigated in patients with gastric cancer, and it has been found that a high expression of CXCR4 is an independent factor of overall survival and cancer-specific survival. The noninvasive imaging of CXCR4 can enable the detection and characterization of aggressive cancers with poor outcomes. The clinical significance of CXCR4 expression in colorectal cancer remains unclear, but it has been found to be associated with lymph node metastasis, TNM stage, and liver metastasis.","conclusions: cxcr4 may serve as a prognostic indicator in gi cancer patients.  cxcr4 protein may be a potential biomarker for liver metastasis and an independent marker for survival in colorectal cancer.  these findings suggest that serum cxcr4 levels may be a useful surrogate marker of clinical outcome in metastatic or recurrent colorectal cancer.  these studies extend the potential roles of cxcr4 in cancer to include functions associated with benign (grade 1) tumors.  the purpose of this study was to evaluate the prognostic and clinicopathological importance of cxcr4 in crc patients.  the aim of this study was to determine the prognostic value of cxcr4 expression in patients with clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (ccrcc).  increased cxcr4 expression, especially in whole cells and cytoplasm, may serve as a poor prognostic indicator in patients with breast cancer.  a high expression of cxcr4 has a prognostic significance with regard to overall and progression-free survival and offers a starting point for targeted therapies.  high expression of pcxcr4 was significantly associated with a favorable prognosis in a test and validation group (p = 0.015 and p = 0.0001).  the role of cxcr4 in cancer will depend on it being in an activated, signaling state.  our studies were designed to investigate the expression and prognostic significance of cxcr4 in patients with gastric cancer.  c-x-c chemokine receptor 4 (cxcr4) is highly expressed in cancers, contributing to proliferation, metastasis, and a poor prognosis.  cxcr4 expression was considered positive when >1% of tumor cells were stained.  by multivariate analysis, a high expression of cxcr4 appeared to be an independent factor of overall survival (p=0.024) and cancer-specific survival (p=0.028).  cxcr4 expression was found in 68/104 (65.4%) of tumor samples.  determination of the cxcr4 receptor status will provide predictive information for disease prognosis and possible therapeutic intervention.  on the basis of tnm stage, detection of cxcr4 expression will be helpful for predicting prognosis for patients with gastric cancer.  the noninvasive imaging of cxcr4 can enable the detection and characterization of aggressive cancers with poor outcomes.  the clinical significance of cxcr4 expression in colorectal cancer remains unclear.  in univariate analysis, cxcr4 was found to be associated with lymph node metastasis, tnm stage, and liver metastasis (p = 0.001, 0.001, and 0.012, respectively). ||| ",Yes
Is recommended the use of perioperative treatment with thyroid hormone therapy in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting?,Yes,"The available evidence suggests that perioperative oral thyroid hormone therapy can significantly attenuate the postoperative decline in serum hormone levels and improve hemodynamic and prognostic parameters in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). However, there is conflicting evidence regarding the usefulness of prophylactic perioperative thyroxine/triiodothyronine therapy as an inotropic adjunct in adult patients undergoing routine cardiac surgery. While some studies report improved hemodynamic parameters in the immediate post-bypass period, there is no evidence that its use influences postoperative morbidity, mortality, or length of stay in the elective patient. Nevertheless, a meta-analysis has shown that thyroid hormone replacement has a positive clinical impact on cardiac function and postoperative characteristics. Therefore, routine thyroxin administration is recommended for a satisfactory outcome in patients undergoing CABG while on thyroxin replacement therapy.","thyroid hormone modifies metabolic, immune and cardiovascular functions and has been administered perioperatively to treat a relative reduction of thyroid function in children following cardiopulmonary bypass (cpb) for correction of congenital heart disease.  to determine perioperative thyroid replacement therapy in patients with hypothyroidism, plasma total thyroxine (t4), total triiodothyroxine (t3), free t4, free t3 and thyroid-stimulating hormone levels were measured preoperatively and at 1, 2, 3, 7, and 14 days after operation in 9 patients with hypothyroidism and were compared with levels in 14 patients with normal thyroid function who underwent coronary bypass surgery.  the available evidence shows that perioperative oral thyroid hormone can significantly attenuate the postoperative decline in the serum hormone level and improve postoperative hemodynamic and prognostic parameters.  the outcome of coronary bypass surgery was analyzed in 25 patients who were on thyroxin replacement therapy for chronic thyroid disorders at the time of operation.  the question addressed was whether the use of prophylactic perioperative thyroxine therapy during cardiopulmonary bypass in the euthyroid adult patient undergoing routine cardiac surgery can result in an improved cardiac output leading to better clinical outcomes.  thyroid hormone changes and their association with global oxygen consumption were studied in low-risk patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (cabg) with and without cpb.  the treatment of hypothyroidism in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery is a difficult clinical problem.  the aim of the present study was to determine whether pretreatment with oral thyroid hormone had beneficial effects in cardiac function and morbidity and mortality after cardiac operations.  a prospective randomized and double-blind study was performed to evaluate whether perioperative triiodothyronine administration has any effect on cardiovascular performance after coronary artery bypass surgery.  however, there is conflicting evidence that prophylactic perioperative thyroxine/triiodothyronine therapy is a useful inotropic adjunct in adult patients undergoing routine cardiac surgery and whilst some studies report improved haemodynamic parameters in the immediate post-bypass period there is no evidence that its use influences postoperative morbidity, mortality or length of stay in the elective patient.  this study evaluated the effect of oral triiodothyronine (t(3)) replacement therapy, starting on the day of the surgery, on thyroid hormone concentrations and clinical outcome in high-risk patients undergoing valvular heart surgery.  in light of the known effects of thyroid hormone on atrial electrophysiology, we investigated the effects of perioperative t3 supplementation on the incidence of postoperative arrhythmias.  a meta-analysis was then conducted to determine the clinical impact of thyroid hormone replacement on cardiac function and postoperative characteristics.  cardiopulmonary bypass results in a euthyroid sick state, and recent evidence suggests that perioperative triiodothyronine (t3) supplementation may have hemodynamic benefits.  we conclude that routine thyroxin administration is all that is required for a satisfactory outcome in patients undergoing coronary bypass surgery while on thyroxin replacement therapy.  however, there has been no study assessing the effects of preoperative oral different-dose thyroid hormone on serum hormone levels and myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury (iri) after cardiac surgery.  thyroid-stimulating hormone (tsh)-suppressive therapy is recommended after surgical treatment in high-risk papillary thyroid carcinoma (ptc) patients.  triiodothyronine administration in patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass surgery is safe, may lessen the need for pharmacological (vasodilator) therapy, but may increase heart rate.  coronary bypass surgery was performed safely in patients with hypothyroidism.  perioperative administration of triiodothyronine increased cardiac output slightly and decreased systemic vascular resistance, but it had no effect on operative outcome. ||| ",No
Does the histidine-rich Ca-binding protein (HRC) interact with triadin?,Yes,"The histidine-rich Ca-binding protein (HRC) has been shown to interact directly with triadin, a transmembrane protein of the junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) in skeletal muscle. This interaction is supported by evidence of a direct binding between HRC and triadin, and the role of HRC in regulating Ca(2+) release during excitation-contraction coupling. The HRC effects on ryanodine receptor (RyR) are regulated by the Ca(2+)-sensitivity of its interaction with triadin. The present study documents the binding interaction of skeletal muscle SR transmembrane protein triadin with peripheral histidine-rich, Ca(2+)-binding protein (HCP). The COOH-terminal portion of rabbit HRC has been characterized with respect to Ca(2+)-binding properties and interaction with triadin on blots, as a function of the concentration of Ca(2+). HRC has been identified from skeletal and cardiac muscle and shown to bind Ca(2+) with low affinity and high capacity. Triadin has been found to dually interact with HCP and calsequestrin (CS) at distinct sites. The binding between intact triadin or expressed triadin peptides and the ryanodine receptor has been investigated using membrane overlay and affinity chromatography. Colocalization of HCP and triadin at junctional triads is supported by the overlapping staining pattern using monoclonal antibodies to triadin. The results identify the polyglutamic stretch near the COOH terminus as the Ca(2+)-binding site responsible for the enhancement by high Ca(2+) of the interaction between HRC and","a direct binding of hrc (histidine-rich ca(2+)-binding protein) to triadin, the main transmembrane protein of the junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum (sr) of skeletal muscle, seems well supported.  because hrc appears to interact directly with triadin, hrc may play a role in the regulation of ca(2+) release during excitation-contraction coupling.  histidine-rich calcium binding protein (hrc) is located in the lumen of sarcoplasmic reticulum (sr) that binds to both triadin (trn) and serca affecting ca(2+) cycling in the sr.  the hrc effects on ryr may be regulated by the ca(2+)-sensitivity of its interaction with triadin.  the present study documents the binding interaction of skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum (sr) transmembrane protein triadin with peripheral histidine-rich, ca(2+)-binding protein (hcp).  here, we characterized the cooh-terminal portion of rabbit hrc, expressed and purified as a fusion protein (hrc(569-852)), with respect to ca(2+)-binding properties, and to the interaction with triadin on blots, as a function of the concentration of ca(2+).  hrc (histidine-rich ca2+ binding protein) has been identified from skeletal and cardiac muscle and shown to bind ca2+ with low affinity and high capacity that is reminiscent of calsequestrin.  suggesting that triadin dually interacts with hcp and with cs, at distinct sites, we have found that triadin-cs interaction in overlays does not require the presence of ca2+.  the histidine-rich ca(2+) binding protein (hrc) is a high capacity ca(2+) binding protein in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (sr).  the histidine-rich calcium binding protein (hrc) is a novel regulator of sarcoplasmic reticulum (sr) ca(2+)-uptake, storage and release.  triadin is a protein first identified as a member of the muscle calcium release complex, involved in calcium release for muscle contraction.  we demonstrate that hrc can be isolated as a complex with triadin, following equilibrium sucrose-density centrifugation in the presence of mm ca(2+).  we observed that hrcn1 binds ca(2+) in a cooperative manner and the ca(2+) binding caused an increase in the α-helix content of hrcn1.  we show a specific binding interaction between digoxigenin-hcp and triadin, using ligand blot techniques.  the putative role(s) of triadin(s) will be discussed here.  the binding between intact triadin or expressed triadin peptides and the ryanodine receptor has been investigated using membrane overlay and affinity chromatography.  colocalization of hcp and triadin at junctional triads is supported by the overlapping staining pattern using monoclonal antibodies to triadin.  our results identify the polyglutamic stretch near the cooh terminus, as the ca(2+)-binding site responsible, both for the acceleration in mobility of hrc on sds-page in the presence of millimolar concentrations of ca(2+), and for the enhancement by high ca(2+) of the interaction between hrc and triadin cytoplasmic segment.  in fact, in vitro generated evidence suggests that hrc directly interacts with sr ca(2+)-atpase2, supporting a dual role of hrc in ca(2+)-homeostasis: regulation of both sr ca(2+)-uptake and ca(2+)-release.  these observations indicate two types of binding between triadin and the ryanodine receptor: (1) a low-affinity ionic interaction of large portions of triadin; (2) a specific high-affinity binding of a short relatively hydrophobic segment. ||| ",Yes

Are stress granules involved in the pathogenesis of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis?,Yes,"Justification: The evidence suggests that stress granules are involved in the pathogenesis of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). Stress granules form during cellular stress and are implicated in neurodegenerative diseases such as ALS and frontotemporal dementia. They are hypothesized to facilitate the cytoplasmic mislocalization and aggregation of TDP-43, a protein linked to ALS pathology. Recent evidence indicates that stress granules may aid the formation of ALS protein aggregates. Many genes whose mutation causes ALS are RNA-binding proteins that localize to stress granules. Alterations in the dynamics of stress granules and RNA biology have been hypothesized to cause ALS. The accumulation of misfolded protein aggregates, a hallmark of ALS, suggests the involvement of protein homeostasis pathways in the disease's etiology. Furthermore, ALS-linked proteins such as FUS and SOD1 are found within stress granules under conditions of induced stress. The formation and disassembly of stress granules are modulated by TDP-43 mutations associated with ALS, suggesting that this may be an early event in the seeding of insoluble cytoplasmic inclusions observed in ALS.","stress granules (sgs) form during cellular stress and are implicated in neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia (als/ftd).  stress granules (sgs) are hypothesized to facilitate tar dna-binding protein 43 (tdp-43) cytoplasmic mislocalization and aggregation, which may underly amyotrophic lateral sclerosis pathology.  recent evidence has suggested that stress granules may aid the formation of als protein aggregates.  these findings indicate that the dysfunction induced by prolonged stress granule formation might contribute directly to als and that compounds that mitigate this process may represent a novel therapeutic approach.  many of the genes whose mutation causes amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (als) are rna-binding proteins which localize to stress granules, while others impact the assembly, stability, and elimination of stress granules.  we also assess the evidence linking alterations in stress granule formation and dynamics to als protein aggregates and disease pathology.  in human als spinal cord neurons, pabp accumulates abnormally, suggesting that prolonged stress granule dysfunction may contribute to pathogenesis.  this has led to the hypothesis that alterations in the dynamics of stress granules and rna biology cause als.  a unifying feature of many proteins associated with als, including tdp-43 and ataxin-2, is that they localize to stress granules.  stress granules (sgs) are stress-induced cytoplasmic protein aggregates containing various neuropathogenic proteins, including tdp-43.  misfolded protein aggregates are the hallmark of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (als) which suggests involvement of protein homeostasis pathways in etiology of als.  amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (als)-linked fused in sarcoma/translocated in liposarcoma (fus/tls or fus) is concentrated within cytoplasmic stress granules under conditions of induced stress.  activation of the integrated stress response (isr), alterations in nucleo-cytoplasmic (n/c) transport and changes in alternative splicing regulation are all common traits of the pathogenesis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (als).  amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, a devastating neurodegenerative disease, is characterized by the progressive loss of motor neurons and the accumulation of misfolded protein aggregates.  amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (als) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease characterized by cytoplasmic protein aggregates within motor neurons.  these aggregates are linked to als pathogenesis.  stress induces aggregation of rna-binding proteins to form inclusions, termed stress granules (sgs).  amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (als) is a degenerative motor neuron disease characterized by the formation of cytoplasmic ubiquitinated tdp-43 protein aggregates in motor neurons.  evidence demonstrates that sod1 harboring als-linked mutations is recruited to stress granules, induces changes in alternative splicing, and could be an rna-binding protein.  our data reveal that under certain stress conditions the rates of sg formation and disassembly is modulated by tdp-43 mutations associated with als, and suggest that this may be an early event in the seeding of insoluble cytoplasmic inclusions observed in als. ||| ",Yes
Is there an association between serum interleukin-6 concentrations and outcomes of stroke patients?,Yes,"The evidence from the present study suggests that interleukin-6 (IL-6) contributes to the determination of the severity of ischemic strokes and may be useful in predicting prognosis. IL-6 is a pleiotropic cytokine that plays a central role in the pathogenesis of stroke and is reportedly increased in serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from acute stroke patients. Several studies have highlighted the role of IL-6 as an early signal of the inflammatory response following acute ischemic stroke. The results of the present study show a complex but potentially beneficial effect of intravenously administered IL-6 in experimental stroke. Clinically, IL-6 values obtained in the first week post-stroke have been shown to correlate with infarct size and outcome. Therefore, there is an association between serum IL-6 concentrations and outcomes of stroke patients.","the present study set out to evaluate the relationship between serum levels of interleukin-6 with long-term and at-hospital outcomes of acute ischemic stroke in patients hospitalized at imam khomeini hospital, urmia, iran, from 2017 to 2018.  in addition, il-6 concentrations affect clinical outcomes in ischemic stroke.  we explored an association between ex vivo cytokine release, circulating interleukin (il)-6 as a marker of systemic inflammation, and stroke prognosis.  interleukin-6 (il-6) is reportedly increased in serum and csf from acute stroke patients.  interleukin-6 (il-6) is pleiotropic cytokine involved in many central nervous system disorders including stroke, and elevated serum il-6 has been found in acute stroke patients.  interleukin-6 (il-6) is one of the inflammatory mediators characterized by elevated levels in ischemic stroke (is) patients.  interleukin-6 (il-6) is among the inflammatory mediators exhibiting elevated levels in ischemic stroke (is) patients.  the evidence from the present study suggests that il-6 contributes to determination of severity of ischemic stroke.  interleukin-6 (il-6) is a pleiotropic cytokine that plays a central role in the pathogenesis of stroke.  several studies have highlighted the role of interleukin-6 (il-6) as an early signal of the inflammatory response following acute ischemic stroke.  il-6 and tnf-alpha release from stimulated blood cells was increased in stroke patients, compared to controls.  the evidence from the present study suggests that il-6 contributes to the determination of the severity of ischemic strokes and may be useful in predicting prognosis.  cytokines interleukin (il)-6 and tumor necrosis factor (tnf)-alpha can play pathogenetic or protective roles in stroke.  in conclusion, the results show a complex but potentially beneficial effect of intravenously administered il-6 in experimental stroke.  our study investigated the frequency of interleukin-6 (il-6) promoter polymorphism rs1800795 (-174 g>c), possible association of this polymorphism with il-6 levels and the outcome after stroke in 95 patients with acute ischemic stroke and 268 healthy subjects.  the aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between il-6 and sil-6r in stroke patients.  we hypothesized that concentrations of interleukin 6 (il-6), serum amyloid a, tumor necrosis factor-α receptor 1, cd40 ligand, and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 would predict recurrent ischemic stroke and major vascular events after recent lacunar stroke.  pro-inflammatory il6 trans-signaling, estimated by the b/t ratio, is associated with ischemic stroke in individuals without af.  this study demonstrates the potential of employing hs-il-6 as an early stage biomarker for the prognosis of acute ischemic stroke.  clinically, il-6 values obtained in the first week post-stroke have been shown to correlate with infarct size and outcome. ||| ",Yes
Is adalimumab effective for hidradenitis suppurativa?,Yes,"Adalimumab, a tumor necrosis factor-α inhibitor, has been shown to be effective for hidradenitis suppurativa in various clinical trials. It is the only biologic therapy approved for the treatment of moderate-to-severe hidradenitis suppurativa, a chronic and disabling skin condition. The efficacy of adalimumab in hidradenitis suppurativa has been demonstrated in phase 2 and phase 4 trials, and it is used as a first-line biologic agent in the management of moderate-to-severe hidradenitis suppurativa. The safety and efficacy of adalimumab in conjunction with surgery has also been studied. However, the effect of adalimumab therapy on the rates of hidradenitis suppurativa is not fully understood.","in a phase 2 trial, adalimumab, an antibody against tumor necrosis factor α, showed efficacy against hidradenitis suppurativa.  our results support adalimumab sb5 as an effective and well tolerated drug, with a good interchangeability with its originator also for the treatment of hidradenitis suppurativa.  adalimumab, a tumor necrosis factor (tnf) inhibitor, has been approved for treatment of hidradenitis suppurativa.  tumor necrosis factor-α inhibitors, adalimumab and infliximab, are at the forefront of biologic therapy for the management of moderate-to-severe hidradenitis suppurativa, with adalimumab as currently the only approved medication for this condition.  adalimumab, a tumor necrosis factor-α inhibitor, is a biologic used for the treatment of moderate-to-severe hidradenitis suppurativa (hs).  adalimumab is the only biologic therapy approved for the treatment of patients with hidradenitis suppurativa, a chronic and disabling skin condition.  the present article aims to analyse the efficacy of adalimumab in hidradenitis suppurativa in comparison with a truly comparable disease, crohn disease, with a view to evaluating therapeutic response rates and to drawing conclusions on the therapeutic success obtained in this disabling cutaneous disease.  the anti-tumour necrosis factor (tnf)-α adalimumab is the only licenced biologic for moderate-to-severe hidradenitis suppurativa (hs).  adalimumab is used as a first-line biologic agent in the management of moderate-to-severe hidradenitis suppurativa (hs).  several studies report the use of tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha) inhibitors in refractory hidradenitis suppurativa (hs), particularly infliximab and etanercept.  the recent approval of adalimumab as the first treatment to be approved for the management of hidradenitis suppurativa has represented a before and after in the control of this chronic inflammatory disease.  the safety and efficacy of adalimumab for hidradenitis suppurativa peri-surgically (sharps) trial was a phase 4, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of adalimumab in conjunction with surgery.  a retrospective observational study was performed in hidradenitis suppurativa adalimumab naive patients and in patients who were switched from the adalimumab originator.  the article reports on three patients with crohn's disease who developed hidradenitis suppurativa during the treatment with adalimumab.  the association of adalimumab therapy with malignancy and infection is established in other inflammatory diseases; however, rates of hidradenitis suppurativa (hs) are based on case reports or retrospective healthcare data and the effect of adalimumab therapy on these rates is unknown.  subcutaneous adalimumab (humira®) is a tumour necrosis factor-α blocker that is the only approved agent for the treatment of moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa (hs) in several countries worldwide.  several patients with hidradenitis suppurativa (hs) present flare-ups during treatment with adalimumab (ada), the cause of which is not clear.  hidradenitis suppurativa is a chronic inflammatory skin disorder associated with inflammatory bowel disease.  hidradenitis suppurativa is a painful, chronic inflammatory skin disease with few options for effective treatment.  this article reviews the clinical efficacy and safety of subcutaneous adalimumab in patients with moderate to severe hs. ||| ",Yes
Are TAD boundaries in Drosophila depleted in highly-expressed genes?,Yes,"The context suggests that TAD boundaries in Drosophila are formed in regions containing active genes and clusters of architectural protein binding sites. However, the presence of active genes does not necessarily imply high expression levels. In fact, the context also mentions that the synteny blocks corresponding to the extremely late-replicating regions in the D. melanogaster genome consistently display two-fold lower gene density. This suggests that TAD boundaries may be depleted in highly-expressed genes, as these regions are associated with lower gene density and late replication, which are characteristics often associated with low gene expression.","in drosophila, tads are often separated by inter-tad regions containing active housekeeping genes and associated insulator binding proteins.  borders between tads are formed in regions containing active genes and clusters of architectural protein binding sites.  in drosophila melanogaster, many of these hd tfs are expressed in the early embryo and control transcription of target genes in development through their interaction with cis-regulatory modules.  eukaryotic chromosomes are partitioned into topologically associating domains (tads) that are demarcated by distinct insulator-binding proteins (ibps) in drosophila.  we investigated the hypothesis that several transcriptional repressors are necessary to set the boundaries of anterior pair-rule stripes in drosophila.  our results are consistent with tll being a newly-identified component of a combinatorial network of repressor genes that control pair-rule stripe formation in the anterior blastoderm of drosophila.  the synteny blocks corresponding to the extremely late-replicating regions in the d. melanogaster genome consistently display two-fold lower gene density across different drosophila species.  our results highlight differences between transcription of tart and of other drosophila non-ltr elements and they provide a foundation for testing the relationship between exceptional aspects of tart transcription and tart's specialized role at telomeres.  transcription start site (tss) evolution remains largely undescribed in drosophila, likely due to limited annotations in non-melanogaster species.  drosophila chromosomes are organized into distinct domains differing in their predominant chromatin composition, replication timing and evolutionary conservation.  we have investigated the role of tgif, a tale-class homeodomain transcription factor, in drosophila development.  the transcription of most genes is repressed after temperature stress in drosophila.  in this study, we introduce a concise new method that selectively sequences from the 5'-end of mrna and used it to identify tss in four drosophila species, including drosophila melanogaster, d. simulans, d. sechellia, and d. pseudoobscura.  evidence is accumulating that silencing of drosophila homeotic genes is conferred by two types of cis- regulatory sequences: initiation (sil-1) and maintenance (sil-m) elements.  here we present a comprehensive analysis of the epigenetic landscape of heterochromatic genes across all the developmental stages of drosophila using the available histone modification and expression data from modencode.  in contrast, several genes in the pericentromeric regions of drosophila melanogaster are dependent on this heterochromatic environment for their expression.  late-replicating domains (intercalary heterochromatin) in the drosophila genome display a number of features suggesting their organization is quite unique.  this observation is consistent with the existence of extensive domains of repressive chromatin that replicate extremely late and have conserved gene order in the drosophila genome.  tad border strength declines, allowing for an increase in long-distance inter-tad interactions.  as a member of the trithorax-group, the trithorax-like (trl) gene of drosophila melanogaster contributes to the expression of homeotic genes and many other genes. ||| ",No
Is Sarcolipin a regulatory/inhibitory protein of the Calcium ATPase SERCA?,Yes,"Sarcolipin, a transmembrane protein, is a regulator of the Sarco/Endoplasmic Reticulum Calcium ATPase (SERCA). It regulates the activity of SERCA1A by decreasing its calcium (Ca2+) transport rate. Sarcolipin inhibits the cardiac Sarco/Endoplasmic Reticulum Calcium ATPase (SERCA2A) by direct binding and is superinhibitory if it binds through Phospholamban (PLN). The protein binds to the same site as the parent protein at the luminal face of SERCA1A, where it reduces the maximum velocity (Vmax) for calcium transport and inhibits ATP hydrolysis. The highly conserved C-terminal region of Sarcolipin helps to target the protein to the Sarcoplasmic Reticulum membrane and may also participate in the regulatory interaction between Sarcolipin and SERCA. The Sarco/Endoplasmic Reticulum Calcium ATPase (SERCA) is regulated in a tissue-dependent manner via interaction with the short integral membrane proteins Phospholamban (PLN) and Sarcolipin (SLN). The Sarco/Endoplasmic Reticulum Calcium ATPase (SERCA) plays a crucial role in maintaining calcium homeostasis, which itself controls various essential cellular functions.","sarcolipin (sln) has been shown recently to uncouple ca transport from adenosine triphosphate hydrolysis by serca.  sarcolipin (sln), a transmembrane peptide, regulates the activity of serca1a by decreasing its ca2+ transport rate, but its mechanism of action is still not well-understood.  sarcolipin (sln), a single-spanning membrane protein, is a regulator of the sarco-endoplasmic reticulum ca2+-atpase (serca1a).  the transmembrane protein sarcolipin regulates calcium storage in the sarcoplasmic reticulum of skeletal and cardiac muscle cells by modulating the activity of sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum ca(2+)-atpases (sercas).  sarcolipin, a homologue of phospholamban, regulates ca2+ uptake through the interaction with sarcoplasmic reticulum ca2+ atpase (serca) and is predominantly expressed in the atrial muscle.  sarcolipin (sln) inhibits the cardiac sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum ca(2+) atpase (serca2a) by direct binding and is superinhibitory if it binds through phospholamban (pln).  sarcolipin (sln) is a key regulator of sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum (sr) ca(2+)-atpase (serca), and its expression is altered in diseased atrial myocardium.  sarcolipin (sln) inhibits the cardiac sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum ca2+ atpase (serca2a) by direct binding and is superinhibitory if it binds as a binary complex with phospholamban (pln).  further solid-state nmr experiments together with functional measurements on serca1a in the presence of nac-rsyqy, a peptide representing the conserved region of sarcolipin, suggest that the peptide binds to the same site as the parent protein at the luminal face of serca1a, where it reduces v(max) for calcium transport and inhibits atp hydrolysis with an ic(50) of approximately 200 microm.  the highly conserved c-terminal region ((27)rsyqy-cooh) of sarcolipin helps to target the protein to the sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane and may also participate in the regulatory interaction between sarcolipin and serca.  the sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum calcium atpase (serca) is regulated in a tissue-dependent manner via interaction with the short integral membrane proteins phospholamban (pln) and sarcolipin (sln).  the sarcoplasmic reticulum (sr) ca2+-atpase (serca2a) is under the control of an sr protein named phospholamban (pln).  sarcolipin (sln), a regulator of the sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum ca(2+)-atpase of fast-twitch skeletal muscle (serca1a), is also expressed in cardiac and slow-twitch skeletal muscles where phospholamban (pln) and serca2a are expressed.  the sarcoplasmic reticulum (sr) ca(2+)-atpase (serca2a) is under the control of a closely associated sr protein named phospholamban (pln).  the sarcoendoplasmic reticulum ca(2+)-atpase (serca) is responsible for intracellular ca(2+) homeostasis.  the sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum ca(2+)-atpase (serca) plays a crucial role in maintaining the ca2+ homeostasis, which itself, controls various essential cellular function.  the sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum ca2+ atpase (serca) actively pumps ca2+ into the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum, thereby regulating intracellular ca2+ concentrations and associated physiological processes.  the sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum ca2+-atpase 2a (serca2a) performs active reuptake of cytoplasmic ca2+ and is a major regulator of cardiac muscle contractility.  serca1a is an atpase calcium pump that transports ca2+ from the cytoplasm to the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum lumen.  ca-atpase regulates intracellular ca levels by pumping ca into sarcoplasmic reticulum. ||| ",Yes
Is cytisine superior to nicotine replacement therapy for smoking cessation?,Yes,"Cytisine has been found to be superior to nicotine replacement therapy in helping smokers quit smoking. In a single-center study, cytisine was more effective than placebo for smoking cessation. The effectiveness of cytisine for continuous abstinence was superior to that of nicotine-replacement therapy at 1 week, 2 months, and 6 months. In a prespecified subgroup analysis of the primary outcome, cytisine was superior to nicotine-replacement therapy among women and noninferior among men. At 1 month, continuous abstinence from smoking was reported for 40% of participants receiving cytisine and 31% of participants receiving nicotine-replacement therapy. Cytisine has also been found to be well-tolerated and more effective than nicotine replacement therapy.","cytisine is more effective than placebo and nicotine replacement therapy for smoking cessation.  we investigated whether cytisine was at least as effective as nicotine-replacement therapy in helping smokers to quit.  when combined with brief behavioral support, cytisine was found to be superior to nicotine-replacement therapy in helping smokers quit smoking, but it was associated with a higher frequency of self-reported adverse events.  the effectiveness of cytisine for continuous abstinence was superior to that of nicotine-replacement therapy at 1 week, 2 months, and 6 months.  cytisine is an effective treatment for smoking cessation with efficacy comparable to that of other currently licensed treatments.  in this single-center study, cytisine was more effective than placebo for smoking cessation.  a recent rigorous study has shown that cytisine, a low-cost drug, is effective for smoking cessation.  cytisine, a partial agonist that binds with high affinity to the α(4)β(2) nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, is a low-cost treatment that may be effective in aiding smoking cessation.  the safety, feasibility, and short-term efficacy of cytisine for smoking cessation were evaluated in active smokers with cad after percutaneous coronary interventions (pci).  in a prespecified subgroup analysis of the primary outcome, cytisine was superior to nicotine-replacement therapy among women and noninferior among men.  at 1 month, continuous abstinence from smoking was reported for 40% of participants receiving cytisine (264 of 655) and 31% of participants receiving nicotine-replacement therapy (203 of 655), for a difference of 9.3 percentage points (95% confidence interval, 4.2 to 14.5).  placebo-controlled trials indicate that cytisine, a partial agonist that binds the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor and is used for smoking cessation, almost doubles the chances of quitting at 6 months.  a systematic review was undertaken to assess the efficacy of cytisine in smoking cessation.  the lower price of cytisine as compared with that of other pharmacotherapies for smoking cessation may make it an affordable treatment to advance smoking cessation globally.  cytisine tablets are very inexpensive to produce and could be a more affordable treatment than nicotine replacement, bupropion and varenicline.  if cytisine is as effective as varenicline, its lower cost and natural plant-based composition may make it an acceptable and affordable smoking cessation medication that could save millions of lives world-wide.  while cytisine has been found to be well-tolerated and more effective than nicotine replacement therapy, direct comparisons with varenicline have not been conducted.  three placebo-controlled trials, conducted in east and west germany in the 1960s and 1970s, suggest that cytisine, even with minimal behavioural support, may be effective in aiding smoking cessation.  although cytisine reversed several effects of nicotine, it seemed to have a reduced potential to produce withdrawal signs in nicotine-dependent subjects.  to examine whether standard cytisine treatment (25 days) was at least as effective as standard varenicline treatment (84 days) for smoking cessation. ||| ",Yes
Is edema a symptom of nephrotic syndrome?,Yes,"The nephrotic syndrome is characterized by the presence of edema, along with other symptoms such as hypoalbuminemia, proteinuria, and hyperlipidemia. Edema is a common presenting feature of nephrotic syndrome and is often the first symptom noticed by patients. The exact mechanism of edema formation in nephrotic syndrome is not fully understood, but it is thought to be related to intravascular volume depletion resulting from leakage of plasma water into the interstitial space and activating secondary renal sodium retention. Additionally, hypoalbuminemia and sodium retention of the proximal tubule are also known to contribute to edema formation in children with steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome. Despite the lack of a complete understanding of the pathogenesis of edema in nephrotic syndrome, it is clear that edema is a key symptom of this condition.","the pathogenesis of edema in nephrotic syndrome is not entirely understood.  because edema is a common presenting feature and hypertension and dyslipidemia are often present in nephrotic syndrome, it is important for the primary care physician to suspect this entity.  edema formation in nephrotic syndrome has been attributed to intravascular volume depletion resulting from leakage of plasma water into the interstitial space and activating secondary renal sodium retention.  oedema is the commonest presenting symptom and sign in nephrotic syndrome.  nephrotic syndrome usually presents with oedema due to fluid accumulation in subcutaneous space.  the aim of this study was to contribute to the discussion on edema pathogenesis in nephrotic syndrome by following changes in volume and sodium retention for the course of the disease in children with steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome (ssns).  oedema formation in nephrotic syndrome (ns) may be associated with volume overload or volume contraction.  the nephrotic syndrome is defined by edema, hypoalbuminemia, proteinuria, and hyperlipemia with elevated cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations in serum or plasma.  peripheral edema, in combination with severe proteinuria and low serum albumin levels, is pathognomonic of the nephrotic syndrome, yet the exact mechanism of its formation is unknown.  nephrotic syndrome, characterized by edema, proteinuria, hyperlipidemia and low serum albumin, is a manifestation of kidney disease involving the glomeruli.  three patients are described, each of whose nephrotic syndrome presented with a less common symptom or sign--recurrent pleural effusion, hypercholesterolaemia and oedema, pulmonary embolism--and, as a result, experienced some diagnostic delay.  nephrotic syndrome with idiopathic membranous nephropathy as a major contributor, is characterized by proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia and oedema.  an increase in cfc provides a potentially novel mechanism contributing at least in part to the formation of peripheral edema in the nephrotic syndrome.  however, clinical studies indicate that edematous patients with nephrotic syndrome may have normal or expanded plasma volumes.  in addition, hypoalbuminemia and sodium retention of the proximal tubule cause edema in children with ssns.  nephrotic syndrome is one cause of end-stage kidney disease.  this article describes the pathophysiology, incidence, clinical presentation, treatment, and disease progression of these nephritic syndrome entities, and provides guidance for when to refer to a nephrologist.  nephritic syndrome is a constellation of hematuria, proteinuria, hypertension, and in some cases acute kidney injury and fluid retention characteristic of acute glomerulonephritis.  fifteen nephrotic subjects with a variety of underlying pathological lesions, and age matched controls were studied.  the exact role of atrial natriutetic peptide (anp) in the pathogenesis of edema in nephrotic syndrome (ns) has not been fully elucidated. ||| ",Yes
Are there interactomes available for POU5F1 and SOX2?,Yes,"The context indicates that there are interactomes available for POU5F1 and SOX2. The study identifies oct-1, encoded by the pou2f1 gene, as a co-factor for sox2 in the context of mouse lens and nasal placode induction. Additionally, the study reveals that sox2 and pou5f1 (oct3 or oct4) transcription factors are implicated in fgf4 expression in embryonic stem (es) cells. The genetic combination of sox2 and pou2f1 mutant alleles results in impaired induction of the lens placode, indicating that pou2f1, sox2 and pax6 are interdependent components of a molecular pathway utilized in both lens and nasal placode induction. The study also identifies two major molecular mechanisms underlying sox-partner factor interactions: cooperative DNA binding and protein interactions dependent upon DNA binding which elicit a large transactivation potential. These findings suggest that there are interactomes available for POU5F1 and SOX2.","recently, many examples of the involvement of sox-pou partnerships in transcription have been discovered, including a partnership between sox-2 and oct-3.  the importance of interactions between sox and pou transcription factors in the regulation of gene expression is becoming increasingly apparent.  members of the pou and sox transcription factor families exemplify the partnerships established between various transcriptional regulators during early embryonic development.  the genes pou5f1 and sox2 are critical for pluripotency and reprogramming, yet the chromosomal organization around these genes remains poorly understood.  sox2, pou5f1, and fgf4 are key molecules for the integrome network in oncology and stem cell biology.  in this report, we identify oct-1, encoded by the pou2f1 gene, as a co-factor for sox2 in the context of mouse lens and nasal placode induction.  specific examples include the sox2-oct3/4 pairing in es cells and the sox2-pax6 pairing in visual system primordia.  sox2 and pou5f1 (oct3 or oct4) transcription factors are implicated in fgf4 expression in embryonic stem (es) cells.  we assayed long-range chromosomal interactions on putative enhancers of pou5f1 and sox2 genes in human embryonic stem cells (hescs) using 4c-seq technique.  genetic combination of sox2 and pou2f1 mutant alleles results in impaired induction of the lens placode, an ocular phenotype that includes anophthalmia, and a complete failure of nasal placode induction.  the mutant has lost its ability to interact with oct4, but remains competent to interact with wild-type sox2.  collectively, these results indicate that pou2f1, sox2 and pax6 are interdependent components of a molecular pathway utilized in both lens and nasal placode induction.  additionally, some genes associated with the pou5f1 enhancer contribute to pluripotency.  two major molecular mechanisms underlie sox-partner factor interactions: (1) cooperative dna binding; and (2) protein interactions dependent upon dna binding which elicit a large transactivation potential.  sox9, tcf/lef, pou2f1 and comp1 binding sites were conserved among human sox2 promoter, rat sox2 promoter, and mouse sox2 promoter.  sox2 plays an important role in early embryogenesis by cooperating with oct4 in regulating gene expression in fertilized eggs, yet the precise mechanism through which sox2 accomplishes this important function remains poorly understood.  sox2 mediates its transcriptional effects through the formation of complexes with specific co-factors, many of which are unknown.  we used the quantitative and scalable cooperativity-by-sequencing (coop-seq) approach to interrogate sox2/pax6 dimerization on a dna library where five positions of the pax6 half-site were randomized yielding 1024 cooperativity factors.  this is the first report on comparative integromics analyses on the sox2 orthologs.  together, these data reveal that sox2 employs a high-affinity/low-specificity paradigm for rna binding in vitro and in vivo. ||| ",Yes
Is there any data to suggest that TRH (thyrotropin releasing hormone) administration can improve symptom severity of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients?,Yes,"Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) has been shown to have potential therapeutic applications in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and related diseases due to its function as a neuroregulator of the anterior horn cell. TRH has a rapid-onset (30 sec), slow-offset (1-12 days) clinical benefit in patients with ALS and other motor neuron disorders. Numerous preclinical studies have demonstrated that posttraumatic treatment of spinal cord injury (SCI) with TRH or TRH analogs improves long-term behavioral recovery. Clinical studies have been divided on the efficacy of TRH, but its mechanism of neuroprotection is poorly understood.

Is Marfan syndrome associated with chordal rupture?,No,"Marfan syndrome is a heritable connective tissue disorder that primarily affects the cardiovascular, ocular, and skeletal systems. The most serious complication in patients with Marfan syndrome is progressive enlargement of the aortic root, which may lead to aortic dissection, rupture, or aortic regurgitation. Although involvement of the mitral valve is a frequently encountered cardiovascular lesion in Marfan syndrome, there is no evidence to suggest that Marfan syndrome is associated with chordal rupture. Chordal rupture is a condition that affects the chordae tendineae, which are tendons that connect the papillary muscles to the mitral valve leaflets. While Marfan syndrome can cause mitral valve prolapse and mitral insufficiency, it does not specifically cause chordal rupture.","marfan syndrome is an inherited systemic connective tissue disease which may lead to aortic root disease causing dilatation, dissection and rupture of the aorta.  marfan's syndrome (mfs), a heritable connective tissue disorder, may result in cardiac valvular insufficiency, aortic aneurysm or dissection, dislocated lens, and musculoskeletal abnormalities.  marfan syndrome is a inherited connective tissue disorder due to mutations in fibrillin-1.  the marfan syndrome is a heritable disorder of connective tissue associated with characteristic abnormalities of the skeletal, ocular and cardiovascular systems.  marfan syndrome (mfs) is a genetic disorder that affects connective tissue, impairing cardiovascular structures and function, such as heart valves and aorta.  marfan's syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder with risk of premature death from rupture of an aneurysm or aortic dissection.  marfan syndrome is a heritable disorder of the connective tissue that affects many systems of the body.  marfan syndrome (mfs) is an inherited connective tissue disease which frequently involves the cardiovascular system.  marfan syndrome is a hereditary disorder of the connective tissue that, in its most classic form, includes cardiovascular, ocular, and skeletal features.  marfan syndrome, a genetic disorder of the connective tissue, may cause aortic root dilation with aortic insufficiency, aortic dissection and mitral prolapse with mitral insufficiency.  a very rare case of marfan syndrome associated with acute aortic regurgitation due to rupture of a fibrous strand of a fenestrated aortic valve is presented.  marfan syndrome (mfs) is a multisystem connective tissue disorder that can lead to aortic dilation requiring aortic root replacement.  marfan syndrome is a heritable, systemic disorder of the connective tissue with a high penetrance, named after dr. antoine marfan.  we report two patients, aged 22 months and 5 years, each presenting an aortic root aneurysm related to marfan syndrome, and each treated with the bentall procedure without specific age-related mortality or morbidity.  the cardiovascular complication typically seen in marfan syndrome is aneurysmal dilatation of the aortic root, which begins in the first or second decade of life and leads to premature death caused by aortic rupture, dissection, or cardiac complications of aortic regurgitation.  this article presents an overview of the marfan syndrome including: history and epidemiology, clinical manifestations, diagnostic criteria, surgical intervention and follow-up.  a patient with marfan syndrome presented with enlargement of lumbosacral spinal canal with a bulky meningocele, and a fusiform aneurysm of the ascending aorta.  marfan syndrome might gradually become recognized as an inherited connective tissue disorder with potentially severe neurological complications during ageing.  however, the most serious complication in patients with marfan syndrome is progressive enlargement of the aortic root, which may lead to aortic dissection, rupture, or aortic regurgitation.  in infantile marfan syndrome, although involvement of the mitral valve is the most frequently encountered cardiovascular lesion, the aortic root can be more worrisome because of its excessive dilatation, leading to aortic insufficiency or dissection. ||| ",Yes
Is Cri Du Chat associated with an expansion of a repeat with in the gene found on chromosome 5?,No,"Cri du Chat syndrome is not associated with an expansion of a repeat within a gene found on chromosome 5. Instead, it is caused by a deletion of genetic material on the small arm (the p arm) of chromosome 5. This deletion results in the characteristic features of the syndrome, including a high-pitched cat-like cry, developmental delay, severe psychomotor and mental retardation, and dysmorphic features in infancy. The incidence of Cri du Chat syndrome is estimated to be 1 in 50,000 individuals worldwide. The unique complex chromosomal rearrangements (ccrs) in the phenotypically normal mother, which resulted in interstitial 5p deletions in the unaffected daughter, have been postulated to have arisen from chromosome 5p chromothripsis. However, the syndrome is not associated with an expansion of a repeat within a gene found on chromosome 5.","cri-du-chat syndrome (cdcs; omim#123450) is a classic contiguous gene syndrome caused by chromosome 5p terminal deletion (5p-), which characterized by a high-pitched cat-like cry, developmental delay, severe psychomotor, mental retardation, and dysmorphic features in infancy.  cri du chat or 5p minus (5p-) syndrome is characterized by a deletion located on the chromosome 5 short (-p) arm and has an incidence rate of 1 in 50,000 individuals worldwide.  cri-du-chat syndrome (mim 123450) is a chromosomal syndrome characterized by the characteristic features, including cat-like cry and chromosome 5p deletions.  cri du chat (cdc) syndrome is a rare genetic condition caused by the deletion of genetic material on the small arm (the p arm) of chromosome 5.  cri du chat syndrome (cdcs) is a well-defined clinical entity, with an incidence of 1/15,000 to 1/50,000.  we postulate that the unique ccrs in the phenotypically normal mother could resulted from chromosome 5p chromothripsis, that further resulted in the interstitial 5p deletions in the unaffected daughter.  we have identified five ccg alleles from 205 normal chromosomes, with 137 (67%) having alleles of seven repeats, five (2%) with nine repeats, 61 (30%) with 10 repeats, one (0.5%) with 11 repeats and one (0.5%) with 12 repeats.  ggggcc repeat expansions in the c9orf72 gene are the most common cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia (c9als/ftd).  the repeat expansion undergoes unconventional translation to produce five dipeptide repeat proteins (dprs).  a hexanucleotide repeat expansion in the c9orf72 gene has been identified as the most common cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia.  a ggggcc hexanucleotide repeat expansion in the c9orf72 gene has been identified as the most common genetic cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia.  the phenotypically normal mother had de novo ccrs involving 11 breakpoints and three chromosomes: ins(11;5) (q23;p14.1p15.31),ins(21;5)(q21;p13.3p14.1),ins(21;5)(q21;p15.31p15.33),inv(7)(p22q32)dn.  the polymorphic cag repeat that is expanded on huntington disease (hd) chromosomes is flanked by a ccg repeat.  the expansion of a noncoding hexanucleotide repeat (ggggcc) in the chromosome 9 open reading frame (c9orf72) gene has been identified as the most common cause of familial and sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (als) in caucasian populations.  we report a family with five individuals showing chromosomal rearrangements involving 5p, resulting from rare maternal complex chromosomal rearrangements (ccrs), diagnosed post- and pre-natally by comprehensive molecular and cytogenetic analyses.  aberrant expansion of the hexanucleotide ggggcc (or g4c2) repeat in the human c9orf72 gene is the most common genetic factor found behind amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia.  the hexanucleotide repeat (ggggcc) expansion in c9orf72 is accounted for a large proportion of the genetic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (als) and frontotemporal dementia (ftd).  our results suggest that the c9orf72 repeat expansion is not the main cause of als in the korean population.  several of these behaviors have been previously reported in patients with 5p deletion syndrome.  it has been reported that hexanucleotide repeat expansions in c9orf72 produce five dipeptide repeat (dpr) proteins by an unconventional repeat-associated non-atg (ran) translation. ||| ",No

Is PLK2 involved in alpha-synuclein phosphorylation in Parkinson disease?,Yes,"The evidence suggests that PLK2 is indeed involved in the phosphorylation of alpha-synuclein in Parkinson's disease. PLK2, a serine/threonine kinase, has been identified as the major enzyme responsible for phosphorylating alpha-synuclein at serine-129, both in vitro and in vivo. This phosphorylation is a hallmark of Parkinson's disease and is associated with the aggregation and toxic accumulation of alpha-synuclein in neurons. Furthermore, studies have shown that genetic knockdown and pharmacological inhibition of PLK2 affect phospho-alpha-synuclein levels in different brain regions. Therefore, it can be concluded that PLK2 plays a significant role in the phosphorylation of alpha-synuclein in Parkinson's disease.","polo like kinase 2 (plk2), a serine/threonine serum inducible kinase, has been proposed to be the major factor responsible for phosphorylating alpha-synuclein (α-syn) at serine-129 (ser-129) in parkinson's disease (pd).  polo-like kinase 2 (plk2) has been recently recognized as the major enzyme responsible for phosphorylation of α-synuclein at s129 in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that this kinase may play a key role in the pathogenesis of parkinson's disease and other synucleinopathies.  these results support a significant role for a plk kinase in phosphorylating α-synuclein at ser129 in the brain, and suggest that plk2 is responsible for this activity under physiological conditions.  alpha-synuclein (α-syn) is a neuronal protein that is highly implicated in parkinson's disease (pd), and protein phosphatase 2a (pp2a) is an important serine/threonine phosphatase that is associated with neurodegenerative diseases, such as pd.  α-synuclein plays important roles in the development of parkinson's disease (pd) pathologies.  polo-like kinase 2 (plk2) was previously proposed as an important kinase in α-synuclein phosphorylation at ser129.  to better understand the role of plk2 in α-synuclein phosphorylation in vivo, we further evaluated the effect of plk2 genetic knockdown and pharmacological inhibition on phospho-α-syn levels in different brain regions of plk2 knockout (ko), heterozygous (het) and wild-type (wt) mice.  α-synuclein (α-syn), especially its abnormal oligomeric and phosphorylated form, plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of parkinson's disease (pd).  although α-synuclein (α-syn) phosphorylation has been considered as a hallmark of sporadic and familial parkinson disease (pd), little is known about the effect of pd-linked mutations on α-syn phosphorylation.  α-synuclein phosphorylated at ser 129 (phospho-α-syn) is the most common synuclein modification observed in parkinson's disease pathology and transgenic animal models.  alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn) phosphorylation at serine 129 is characteristic of parkinson disease (pd) and related alpha-synulceinopathies.  elevated phosphorylation of the pd-defining pathological protein, α-synuclein, correlates with its aggregation and toxic accumulation in neurons, whilst genetic missense mutations in the kinases pten-induced putative kinase 1 and leucine-rich repeat kinase 2, increase susceptibility to pd.  it is known that α-synuclein is phosphorylated (p-α-synuclein) in pd and tau-hyperphosphorylation (p-tau) is also a pathologic feature of pd.  the pathologic accumulation and aggregation of α-synuclein (α-syn) underlies parkinson's disease (pd).  to gain insight into the functions of alpha-synuclein, we sought protein kinases that phosphorylate alpha-synuclein in the central nervous system.  alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn) is implicated in the pathogenesis of parkinson's disease, genetically through missense mutations linked to early onset disease and pathologically through its presence in lewy bodies.  alpha-synuclein, a major constituent of lewy bodies (lbs), has been implicated to play a critical role in the pathogenesis of parkinson's disease (pd), although the physiological function of alpha-synuclein has not yet been known.  here, we show that expression of g2019s-lrrk2 increases α-synuclein mobility and enhances aggregation of α-synuclein in primary cultured neurons and in dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta, a susceptible brain region in pd.  increasing evidence suggests that phosphorylation may play an important role in the oligomerization, fibrillogenesis, lewy body (lb) formation, and neurotoxicity of alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn) in parkinson disease.  recent studies demonstrated cutaneous phosphorylated α synuclein (p-syn) deposition in idiopathic and some monogenetic parkinson disease (pd) patients, suggesting synucleinopathy identical to that in the brain. ||| ",Yes
Is abdominal pain a common symptom in autism?,Yes,"The evidence suggests that abdominal pain is a common symptom in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Studies have reported an increase in bowel symptoms, including abdominal pain, in children with ASD. The severity of ASD symptoms has been correlated with the severity of gastrointestinal symptoms. Additionally, recurrent abdominal pain in children has been associated with visceral hyperalgesia. However, it is important to note that these gastrointestinal symptoms are not exclusively associated with ASD and can overlap with other conditions, making accurate diagnosis challenging. Further systematic examination is needed to fully understand the relationship between ASD and abdominal pain.","individuals with autism spectrum disorder are more likely than typically developing individuals to experience a range of gastrointestinal abnormalities, including chronic diarrhea, constipation, food sensitivities, and abdominal pain.  there is an emerging body of evidence associating children having autism spectrum disorder (asd) with gastrointestinal (gi) symptoms, such as abdominal pain, chronic diarrhea, constipation, vomiting, gastroesophageal reflux, intestinal infections, and increased intestinal permeability.  this study confirms previously reported findings of an increase in bowel symptoms in children with autism.  increased severity of autism spectrum disorder symptoms was correlated with increased gastrointestinal symptom severity.  we investigated the relationship between autism spectrum disorder symptom severity and gastrointestinal symptoms while accounting for three associated behavioral symptom domains (irritability, aggressiveness, and specific fears), in a sample of 176 children (140 males and 36 females) ages 2-7 years old with autism spectrum disorder.  recent research has suggested that autism spectrum disorder (asd) and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (adhd) may be comorbid to pediatric chronic pain, but the empirical support is yet scarce.  evidence is accumulating that recurrent abdominal pain (rap) in children is associated with visceral hyperalgesia.  these gastrointestinal symptoms have been associated with higher levels of irritability and aggressive behavior, but less is known about their relationship with core autism spectrum disorder symptoms.  there was a significant difference in the reporting of certain bowel symptoms (constipation, diarrhoea, flatulence) and food faddiness between the autism group and the mainstream school control group.  anxiety and depression are implicated as contributors to abdominal pain in pediatric irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) but is unclear if this pain is associated with other psychological factors.  frequent abdominal pain (ap) in children and adolescents is often designated as functional gastrointestinal disorder.  abdominal pain and other gastrointestinal symptoms are common presenting features of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (mis-c) and can overlap with infectious or inflammatory abdominal conditions, making accurate diagnosis challenging.  it would appear, however, that this is not specifically associated with autism as bowel symptoms were reported in similar frequency to a comparison group of children with other developmental and neurological disorders.  individuals with autism spectrum disorder (asd) often exhibit differences in pain responsivity.  the abdominal wall is an often overlooked source of pain in children with chronic abdominal pain.  using a bowel symptom questionnaire we compared 51 children with autism spectrum disorder with control groups of 35 children from special school and 112 from mainstream school.  asthma at 1 and 2 years and food hypersensitivity at 8 years were significantly associated with abdominal pain at 12 years.  this review suggests that contrary to classical reports, individuals with autism spectrum disorder do not appear to have systematically altered pain responses or thresholds.  signs of pain-related distress).  more systematic experimental examination of this area is needed to understand responses to pain of individuals with autism spectrum disorder. ||| ",Yes

Can adult humans be induced to produce fetal hemoglobin?,Yes,"The context suggests that adult humans can be induced to produce fetal hemoglobin. This is supported by evidence that fetal hemoglobin production can be reactivated in vivo in adult persons with various hemoglobinopathies and other hemopoietic disorders. Experimental results have indicated that these diseases could be treated by induction of fetal-type hemoglobin. The therapeutic induction of fetal hemoglobin is considered one of the most promising approaches to ameliorate the severity of hemoglobinopathies like β-thalassemia and sickle cell anemia. Fetal hemoglobin production in adult human erythroid progenitors can be influenced by exogenous factors, such as pharmacological agents like hydroxycarbamide, which can increase fetal hemoglobin synthesis during adult life. The ontogenic switch from fetal to adult hemoglobin could be due to gradual replacement of fetal by adult erythroid progenitor cells, each with unique potential hemoglobin expression programs. Increased fetal hemoglobin in erythroid precursors of patients with beta-hemoglobinopathies can ameliorate the clinical symptoms of the underlying diseases. These findings provide direct in vivo evidence that fetal-globin expression in the adult is controlled at the level of erythroid progenitors.","fetal hemoglobin production can be reactivated in vivo in adult persons with various hemoglobinopathies and other hemopoietic disorders, and in cultures of adult erythroid progenitors.  some experimental results have suggested that these diseases could be treated by induction of fetal-type hemoglobin (hbf).  therapeutic induction of fetal hemoglobin (hbf) is one of the most promising approaches to ameliorate the severity of hemoglobinopathies like β-thalassemia and sickle cell anemia.  increasing fetal hemoglobin (hbf) levels in adult humans remains an active area in hematologic research.  fetal hemoglobin production in adult human erythroid progenitors can be influenced by exogenous factors.  some pharmacological agents, such as hydroxycarbamide (hc), can increase fetal haemoglobin synthesis during adult life.  increased fetal hemoglobin (hb f; alpha(2)gamma(2)) production in adults can ameliorate the clinical severity of sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia major.  the ontogenic switch from fetal to adult hemoglobin could be due to gradual replacement of fetal by adult erythroid progenitor cells, each with unique potential hemoglobin expression programs.  increased fetal hemoglobin (hbf) in erythroid precursors of patients with beta-hemoglobinopathies (sickle cell anemia and beta-thalassemia), in which adult hemoglobin synthesis is defective, ameliorates the clinical symptoms of the underlying diseases.  fetal cells at 70-75 days gestation continue to synthesize only fetal hemoglobin, whereas cells from 100-day gestation fetuses appear to rapidly switch to adult hemoglobin production after transplantation.  these results provide direct in vivo evidence that fetal-globin expression in the adult is controlled at the level of erythroid progenitors.  to investigate whether the level of maturity of human erythroid cells influences the expression of the fetal hemoglobin program, we studied the relative production of fetal (hb f) and adult (hb a) hemoglobins during the maturation of erythroid clones produced in vitro by adult or neonatal erythroid stem cells.  clonal erythroid cultures have been used in the investigation of the cellular mechanisms underlying the switch from fetal to adult hb formation during ontogeny and the expression of fetal hemoglobin in adult life.  increased expression of fetal haemoglobin (hbf) may ameliorate the clinical course of beta-thalassemia and sickle cell disease.  adult erythroid progenitors produce significantly higher fetal hemoglobin (hbf) levels in cultures containing fetal calf serum (fcs) and erythropoietin (ep) than in vivo.  the most direct available approach to determine the cellular control of the switch from fetal to adult hemoglobin is to examine the pattern of hemoglobin synthesis by fetal hemopoietic cells after their transplantation to an adult animal.  a recent theory of the control of human fetal hemoglobin synthesis, based on studies in cultured adult marrow, proposes that the phenotypic expression of fetal hemoglobin is largely dependent on the level of differentiation of the parental stem cells; that is, the earlier the progenitor, the greater the ability of its progeny to express fetal hemoglobin  to test directly whether the control of fetal hemoglobin (hbf) in the adult takes place at the level of erythroid progenitors or at the level of erythroblasts, we treated animals with high doses of erythropoietin and examined the effects of this manipulation on the globin gene programs of erythroid progenitors.  although erythroid cells prepared from fetal liver, cord blood, or blood from β-thalassemia patients are known to express fetal hemoglobin at high levels, the underlying mechanisms remain elusive.  these data suggest that erythroblast targeting of lin28a expression is sufficient for increasing fetal hemoglobin expression in adult human erythroblasts. ||| ",Yes

However, it is important to note that individual paralogs can have vastly different effects on cellular processes, indicating differential regulation of subfunctionalized paralogs.","we hypothesize that paralogs share common regulatory mechanisms to enable coordinated expression according to tads.  consequently, paralogs show correlation in gene expression whereby the mechanisms of co-regulation remain unclear.  combined, our results indicate that paralogs share common regulatory mechanisms and cluster not only in the linear genome but also in the three-dimensional chromatin architecture.  paralogs are genes that most probably share duplication history and show a significant similarity in their sequences, even if they perform slightly different biological function.  strikingly, half the surveyed paralog pairs were found to be co-clustered in protein complexes, and were more conserved and highly expressed than non-co-clustered paralogs; however, their discordant expression patterns and conservation rates indicate differential regulation of subfunctionalized paralogs.  duplicate genes of this form are called paralogs and such genes share a high degree sequence similarity as well as often having closely related functions.  many genomes contain families of paralogs--proteins with divergent function that evolved from a common ancestral gene after a duplication event.  paralogous genes are genes which descend from a progenitor gene which has duplicated as an ancestral gene, each copy having diverged prior to speciation.  paralog genes arise from gene duplication events during evolution, which often lead to similar proteins that cooperate in common pathways and in protein complexes.  we show that paralog gene pairs are enriched for co-localization in the same tad, share more often common enhancer elements than expected and have increased contact frequencies over large genomic distances.  however, individual paralogs can confer vastly different effects upon cellular processes, e.g., specific yeast paralogs regulate actin organization, bud site selection, and mrna localization, although how specificity is conferred is unknown.  this enables concerted expression of paralogs over diverse cell-types and indicate evolutionary constraints in functional genome organization.  they have led to the constitution of subfamilies of paralogous genes.  homologous genes are classified into orthologs and paralogs, depending on whether they arose by speciation or duplication.  by comparison to vertebrate parahox gene regulation we explore the evolutionary implications.  this implies that each gene in a species does not always have an ortholog in another species and thus, due to multiple duplication events following a speciation, many orthologous clades of paralogs are generated.  genomes can be described as a collection of clusters, the gene families, whose members are called paralogs.  paralogous proteins play a vital role in evolutionary adaptation of organisms and species divergence.  chromosomal regions that contain present-day paralogs (paralogous regions or paralogons) have been identified in mammals.  the reason is that most families contain paralogs, i.e., more than one homologous sequence per species. ||| ",Yes
Does the CTCF protein co-localize with cohesin?,Yes,"The CTCF protein has been shown to co-localize with cohesin in mammalian genomes, as evidenced by their frequent colocalization and the role of CTCF in recruiting the cohesin complex to chromatin. The interaction between CTCF and cohesin involves direct contacts between the cohesin subunit SA2 and specific regions of the C-terminal tail of CTCF. This interaction is specifically required for CTCF-anchored loops and contributes to the positioning of cohesin at CTCF binding sites. Furthermore, sites of CTCF and cohesin co-occupancy have been found to be enriched in gene promoters in HSPC and erythroid cells compared to single CTCF or cohesin sites. These findings suggest that CTCF and cohesin play critical roles in a number of cellular processes, including transcription, maintenance of chromatin domain architecture, and insulator function.","taken together, our results demonstrate that specific sites on the c terminus of ctcf are essential for cohesin binding and insulator function.  here we show that a segment within the ctcf n terminus interacts with the sa2-scc1 subunits of human cohesin.  ctcf is dispensable for cohesin loading onto dna, but is needed to enrich cohesin at specific binding sites.  cohesin frequently colocalizes with ctcf (ccctc-binding factor), affecting genomic stability, expression and epigenetic homeostasis.  we show here that the interaction of ctcf with the cohesin complex involves direct contacts between the cohesin subunit sa2 and specific regions of the c-terminal tail of ctcf.  in mammalian genomes, cohesin co-localizes with ccctc binding factor (ctcf), a zinc finger protein implicated in multiple gene regulatory events.  the binding of cohesin to euchromatic regions is largely mediated by ctcf or the mediator complex.  most of these interactions involve recruitment of the cohesin complex to chromatin via ctcf.  we demonstrate that this interaction is specifically required for ctcf-anchored loops and contributes to the positioning of cohesin at ctcf binding sites.  recent studies have shown that the protein ctcf, which plays an important role in insulation and in large-scale organization of chromatin within the eukaryotic nucleus, depends for both activities on recruitment of the cohesin complex.  cohesin subunits are mutated in cancer, but ctcf/cohesin-binding sites (cbss) in dna have not been examined for mutations.  the only direct interaction between ctcf and cohesin involves contact with sa2, which is external to the cohesin ring.  functionally, ctcf associates with thousands of genomic sites and interacts with proteins, such as cohesin, or non-coding rnas to facilitate specific transcriptional programming.  cohesin catalyses the folding of the genome into loops that are anchored by ctcf1.  recent studies show that ctcf recruits the cohesin complex to insulator sites and that cohesin is required for insulator activity.  we find that ctcf also interacts with the centromeric protein cenp-e both in vitro and in vivo.  sites of ctcf and cohesinsa-1 co-occupancy were enriched in gene promoters in hspc and erythroid cells compared to single ctcf or cohesin sites.  cohesin is implicated in establishing tissue-specific dna loops that target enhancers to promoters, and also localizes to sites bound by the insulator protein ctcf, which blocks enhancer-promoter communication.  a number of factors have been reported to co-localize with ctcf and regulate ctcf loops, but no comprehensive analysis of binding partners has been performed.  ctcf and cohesinsa-1 are regulatory proteins involved in a number of critical cellular processes including transcription, maintenance of chromatin domain architecture, and insulator function. ||| ",Yes
Is H4K20 methylation associated with DNA replication?,Yes,"Justification: The methylation state of lysine 20 on histone H4 (H4K20) has been linked to DNA replication. Histone H4 lys 20 methylation (H4K20me) has been implicated in regulating diverse processes ranging from the DNA damage response, mitotic condensation, and DNA replication to gene regulation. The methylation of H4K20 is cell cycle-regulated, consistent with increased H4 lys 20 methylation at mitosis. New H4 is methylated regardless of prior acetylation, and acetylation occurs predominantly on K20-dimethylated H4. Metabolic labeling and top-down mass spectrometry reveal that newly synthesized H4 is progressively methylated at K20 during the G(2), M, and G(1) phases of the cell cycle in a process that is largely inescapable and irreversible.","h4k20 methylation is a broad chromatin modification that has been linked with diverse epigenetic functions.  the methylation state of lysine 20 on histone h4 (h4k20) has been linked to chromatin compaction, transcription, dna repair and dna replication.  histone h4 lys 20 methylation (h4k20me) has been implicated in regulating diverse processes ranging from the dna damage response, mitotic condensation, and dna replication to gene regulation.  together, these findings suggest that methylations of histone h3-k9 and k36 by clr4 and set2 are functionally linked to dna replication checkpoint via accumulation of mik1.  methylation of histone h4 at lysine 20 (k20) has been implicated in transcriptional activation, gene silencing, heterochromatin formation, mitosis, and dna repair.  histone h4 methyltransferase activity was found to be cell cycle-regulated, consistent with increased h4 lys 20 methylation at mitosis.  it seems likely that continued study of the methylation of h4k20 will yield extremely valuable insights concerning the regulation of histone modifications before and during cell division and the impact of these modifications on subsequent gene expression.  h4k20 monomethylation maintains genome integrity by regulating proper mitotic condensation, dna damage response, and replication licensing.  new h4 is methylated regardless of prior acetylation, and acetylation occurs predominantly on k20-dimethylated h4, refuting the hypothesis that k20 methylation antagonizes h4 acetylation and represses transcription epigenetically.  methylation of histone h4 lysine 20 (h4k20) has been associated with cancer.  we employed genetic, cytological, and genomic approaches to better understand the role of pr-set7 and h4k20 methylation in regulating dna replication and genome stability in drosophila cells.  several enzymes target h4k20 methylation, consistent with distinct mono-, di-, and trimethylation states controlling different biological outputs.  the molecular biology of histone h4 lysine 20 (h4k20) methylation, like many other post-translational modifications of histones, has been the subject of intensive interest in recent years.  monomethylation of h4k20 (h4k20me1) is mediated by the cell cycle-regulated histone methyltransferase pr-set7.  while there is an emerging consensus linking h4k20me1, h4k20me2, and h4k20me3 to transcription, repair, and constitutive heterochromatin, respectively, the specific details of these associations and the biological mechanisms by which the methylated histones are introduced and function are now the subject of active investigation.  monomethylation of h4k20 has been implicated in regulating diverse biological processes including the dna damage response.  metabolic labeling and top-down mass spectrometry reveal that newly synthesized h4 is progressively methylated at k20 during the g(2), m, and g(1) phases of the cell cycle in a process that is largely inescapable and irreversible.  in previous analyses of histone methylation dynamics in mid-gestation mouse embryos, we documented marked changes in h4k20 methylation during cell differentiation.  approximately 98% of new h4 becomes dimethylated within two to three cell cycles, and k20 methylation turnover in vivo is undetectable.  methylation of histone h4 on lysine 20 plays critical roles in chromatin structure and function via mono- (h4k20me1), di- (h4k20me2), and trimethyl (h4k20me3) derivatives. ||| ",Yes
Does thyroid hormone affect cardiac remodeling?,Yes,"Thyroid hormones have been shown to exert broad effects on the adult heart, influencing cardiac performance directly and indirectly through changes in peripheral circulation. Recent research has revealed novel actions of thyroid hormone on the heart, which may be of important physiological and therapeutic relevance. Thyroid hormone acts on the heart and peripheral vasculature in multiple ways, playing a pivotal role in cardiac homeostasis. Changes in thyroid status are associated with profound alterations in biochemical and physiological functioning of cardiac muscle. Although the influence of thyroid hormones on cardiac remodeling has not been thoroughly investigated at the molecular and cellular levels, it is evident that thyroid hormone has important cellular growth functions in both physiological and pathophysiological states. Therefore, it can be concluded that thyroid hormone does affect cardiac remodeling.","thyroid hormones have a significant impact on cardiac function and structure.  thyroid hormone exerts broad effects on the adult heart, but little is known regarding the role of thyroid hormone in the regulation of cardiac growth early in development and in response to pathophysiological conditions.  thyroid hormone plays an important role on myocardial development and function.  the purpose of this paper is to study the effect of hypothyroidism and thyroid replacement therapy on cardiac alterations.  thyroid hormones influence cardiac performance directly and indirectly via changes in peripheral circulation.  however, the influence of thyroid hormones on cardiac remodeling has not been thoroughly investigated at the molecular and cellular levels.  recent research has revealed novel actions of thyroid hormone (th) on the heart which may be of important physiological and therapeutic relevance.  thyroid hormone acts on the heart and peripheral vasculature in multiple ways.  thyroid hormones (ths) play a pivotal role in cardiac homeostasis.  excessive production of thyroid hormone results in an increased cardiac output as well as increased cardiac work efficiency, but reduced cardiac reserve.  heart dysfunctions have been shown to be associated with altered concentrations of thyroid hormones.  triiodothyronine (t3) has many effects on the heart, and marked changes in cardiac function and structure occur in patients with (subclinical) thyroid disease.  thyroid hormone has important cardiovascular effects, and abnormalities of its production cause cardiovascular morbidity.  thyroid hormone acts through genomic and non-genomic mechanisms to regulate cardiac function.  the role of both excessive and insufficient thyroid hormone production in the pathogenesis of clinical cardiac diseases can be deduced from thyroid hormone-induced molecular changes.  changes in the th-thyroid hormone receptor axis are also evident in patients with heart failure and associated with impaired cardiac function and increased mortality.  changes in thyroid status are associated with profound alterations in biochemical and physiological functioning of cardiac muscle, although its impact on cardiac energy metabolism is still debated.  we have demonstrated a strong positive association between thyroid hormone levels within the euthyroid range and heart rate, and more subtle effects on cardiac function and structure.  we investigated whether between-subject variation in thyroid hormone levels within the euthyroid range is also associated with heart rate and echocardiographic heart function and structure.  these findings suggest that in the late-gestation fetal heart, thyroid hormone has important cellular growth functions in both physiological and pathophysiological states. ||| ",Yes
Can Preimplantation Genetic Diagnosis (PGD) be used for gender selection?,Yes,"Preimplantation Genetic Diagnosis (PGD) has been used for gender selection, as indicated by the context provided. The procedure permits the selection of embryos of a particular genotype prior to implantation, and has been extended to other indications beyond its original purpose of diagnosing embryo-related genetic abnormalities. The use of PGD for gender selection may not breach the principles of ethics and is unlikely to alter the population balance of sexes. However, it is important to consider the clinical and ethical issues prior to offering PGD gender selection, particularly in cases where the child is at risk of a non-Mendelian condition with unequal sex incidence.","pgd has already been used to select embryos of a desired gender in the absence of any history of sex-linked genetic disease.  preimplantation genetic diagnosis (pgd) was introduced at the beginning of the 1990s as an alternative to prenatal diagnosis, to prevent termination of pregnancy in couples with a high risk for offspring affected by a sex-linked genetic disease.  preimplantation genetic diagnosis (pgd) permits the selection of embryos of a particular genotype prior to implantation.  performance of preimplantation genetic diagnosis per request specifically for gender selection by an infertile couple undergoing medically indicated assisted reproductive technique may not breach the principles of ethics, and is unlikely to alter the population balance of sexes.  here, we examine the clinical and ethical issues to be considered prior to offering pgd gender selection to reduce the risk of a child being affected by a non-mendelian condition with unequal sex incidence.  preimplantation genetic diagnosis (pgd) is an increasingly common adjunct to ivf.  preimplantation genetic diagnosis (pgd) has proven to be a useful reproductive option for carriers of some chromosome rearrangements.  eugenic selection of embryos is now possible by employing in vitro fertilization (ivf) and preimplantation genetic diagnosis (pgd).  preimplantation genetic diagnosis (pgd) was originally developed for couples whose potential offspring were at risk of severe mendelian disorders, but has since been extended to other indications.  in an attempt to identify x-linked mutation-free embryos for transfer, the present authors introduced preimplantation genetic diagnosis (pgd), using a sequential first and second polar body analysis, as an alternative to gender determination.  one possible use of pgd is to perform gender selection for couples whose offspring are at increased risk of disorders that do not follow mendelian inheritance, but which are substantially more common in one sex than another (unequal sex incidence).  preimplantation genetic diagnosis (pgd) is a novel procedure whose use may be considered to obtain a very early prenatal diagnosis for couples at risk for transmitting genetic diseases.  the use of preimplantation genetic diagnosis (pgd) to select genetically 'normal' human embryos and to transfer them to the uterus of a woman has generated considerable controversy.  the purpose of this article is to ascertain and appraise the ethical issues inherent to the utilisation of preimplantation genetic diagnosis for gender selection in infertile patients anticipating undergoing a medically indicated assisted reproductive technique procedure.  preimplantation genetic diagnosis (pgd) is an increasingly common adjunct to ivf and is used to evaluate the genetic makeup of the embryo prior to transfer of the embryo into the uterus.  preimplantation genetic diagnosis (pgd) was originally developed to diagnose embryo-related genetic abnormalities for couples who present a high risk of a specific inherited disorder.  an analysis of these issues in the context of using pgd for selecting embryos unaffected by a serious disorder and for sex selection is presented.  preimplantation genetic diagnosis (pgd) can be offered as an alternative to prenatal diagnosis (pnd) to couples at risk of having a child with a genetic disease.  preimplantation genetic diagnosis (pgd), used in clinical practice, is offered to couples that may suffer from a monogenetic disorder, chromosome aneuploidy, or x-linked disease.  recently, preimplantation genetic diagnosis (pgd) has been considered for several indications beyond its original purpose, not only to test embryos for genetic disease but also to select embryos for a nondisease trait, such as specific human leukocyte antigen (hla) genotypes, related to immune compatibility with an existing affected child in need of a haematopoetic stem cell (hsc) transplant. ||| ",Yes
Does mTOR regulate the translation of MAPKAPK2?,No,"The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a serine/threonine protein kinase that regulates the phosphorylation and activity of several proteins involved in translation, such as p70S6 kinase and the eIF4E-binding proteins 4E-BP1 and 4E-BP2. However, there is no evidence in the provided context that mTOR regulates the translation of MAPKAPK2. MAPKAPK2, also known as MAPK-activated protein kinase 2, is a serine/threonine kinase that is activated by the MAPK signaling pathway and is involved in various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. While mTOR plays a crucial role in regulating translation and cell growth, its specific involvement in the regulation of MAPKAPK2 translation is not mentioned in the provided context.","the protein kinase mammalian target of rapamycin (mtor) regulates the phosphorylation and activity of several proteins that have the potential to control translation, including p70s6 kinase and the eif4e binding proteins 4e-bp1 and 4e-bp2.  these results suggest a novel regulatory mechanism for mtor gene expression that integrates the global protein synthesis changes induced by translational inhibitory conditions.  the mammalian target of rapamycin (mtor) is a ser/thr (s/t) protein kinase, which controls mrna translation initiation by modulating phosphorylation of the translational regulators phas-i and p70(s6k).  mammalian target of rapamycin (mtor) is a key kinase downstream of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (pi3k)/akt predominantly involved in translational control in the presence of nutrients and energy.  mammalian target of rapamycin (mtor) is a member of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-related kinase (pikk) family and is a major regulator of translation, cell growth, and autophagy.  these data suggest that under certain stress conditions: (i) translation has a greater requirement for mtor activity and (ii) there is an absolute requirement for the 4e-bps for regulation by mtor.  the kinase mtor (mammalian target of rapamycin) promotes translation as well as cell survival and proliferation under nutrient-rich conditions.  whereas mtor activates translation through ribosomal protein s6 kinase (s6k) and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4e-binding protein (4e-bp), how it facilitates cell proliferation has remained unclear.  moreover, our data reveal that the cap-independent translation of mtor is necessary for its ability to induce cell-cycle progression into s phase.  akt and rheb, a gtp-binding protein, regulate mtor protein kinase activity.  the levels of p-mtor are regulated by the protein kinase b (akt/pkb).  tti1 constitutively interacts with mtor in both mtorc1 and mtorc2.  mtor is a downstream mediator in the pi3k/akt signaling pathway and plays a critical role in cell survival.  mammalian target of rapamycin (mtor) is a serine-threonine kinase member of the cellular phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (pi3k) pathway, which is involved in multiple biologic functions such as transcriptional and translational control.  the mammalian target of rapamycin (mtor) has been shown to link growth factor signaling and posttranscriptional control of translation of proteins that are frequently involved in cell cycle progression.  mechanistic target of rapamycin (mtor) controls global translation of mrna into protein by phosphorylating p70 s6 kinase (s6k) and eif4e-binding protein-1.  the mammalian target of rapamycin (mtor), is a serine/threonine protein kinase and belongs to the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (pi3k)-related kinase (pikk) family.  the mammalian target of rapamycin (mtor) is a key element of the pi3kakt (protein kinase b) signalling pathway, responsible for the regulation of cell growth and proliferation.  the mammalian target of rapamycin (mtor), a member of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase related kinase (pikk) family, plays a central role in the regulation of cell growth.  mtorc2 mainly controls cell survival and migration through phosphorylating glucocorticoid-regulated kinase (sgk), protein kinase b (akt), and protein kinase c (pkc) kinase families. ||| ",Yes
Is Achondroplasia associated with hearing loss?,Yes,"Justification: Achondroplasia, a genetic condition characterized by disordered endochondral ossification, is associated with an increased risk of hearing loss. This is evidenced by the prevalence of recurrent otitis media infections, chronic middle ear effusion, and hearing loss in children with achondroplasia. In adults with this condition, audiovestibular dysfunction is common, with sensorineural hearing loss being the most frequent form. High-resolution computed tomography of temporal bones in individuals with achondroplasia has revealed several morphological abnormalities characteristic of the condition, further supporting the association between achondroplasia and hearing loss. The importance of regular hearing assessments as part of standard care in achondroplasia, including adolescents and young adults, is emphasized in the context.","adults with achondroplasia are at increased risk of early hearing loss.  this population-based study investigated the prevalence, severity, and type of hearing loss in norwegian adults with achondroplasia.  recurrent otitis media infections, chronic middle ear effusion, and hearing loss are common in children with achondroplasia, but few studies have investigated hearing loss in adults with this condition.  we present a patient with achondroplasia who presented with hearing loss and was referred to radiology for temporal bone imaging.  authors experienced a case of an achondroplastic patient with bilateral hearing disturbance.  our findings underline the importance of a regular hearing assessment being part of standard care in achondroplasia, including adolescents and young adults.  temporal bone and middle ear structures are distorted in achondroplasia because of rotational change of the skull base.  achondroplasia is a genetic condition caused by disordered endochondral ossification, which leads to rhizomelic dwarfism and midfacial hypoplasia.  we collected data on 45 adults with genetically confirmed achondroplasia: 23 men and 22 women, aged 16-70 years.  previous studies of this disorder have identified a significant incidence of associated hearing loss.  potential medical complications associated with achondroplasia include lower extremity long bone bowing, middle-ear dysfunction, obstructive sleep apnea, and, more rarely, cervicomedullary compression, hydrocephalus, thoracolumbar kyphosis, and central sleep apnea.  high-resolution computed tomography of temporal bones demonstrated several interesting morphological abnormalities characteristic of achondroplasia.  achondroplasia is the most common skeletal dysplasia and it combines various complications with normal longevity.  audiovestibular dysfunction is encountered in as and sensorineural hearing loss is the most common form.  otosclerosis is a frequent cause of deafness in adults.  cochlear nerve aplasia or hypoplasia is found in up to a half of patients with unilateral or bilateral hearing loss.  achondroplasia is the most common short-stature skeletal dysplasia, additionally marked by rhizomelia, macrocephaly, midface hypoplasia, and normal cognition.  hearing loss is a common sensory deficit in humans.  additionally, we aimed to determine if audiological outcomes differed in children with aplasia from those with hypoplasia.  achondroplasia is the most common form of disproportionate skeletal dysplasia. ||| ",Yes
Can NEECHAM Confusion Scale be used for evaluation of postoperative delirium?,Yes,"The NEECHAM Confusion Scale has been used in various studies to evaluate postoperative delirium in surgical ward patients. The scale was employed to identify cases of possible confusion early, indicating its usefulness for the detection of postoperative delirium and confusion. The trends of NEECHAM scores in different patient groups were compared, and the relationship between NEECHAM scores and clinical risk factors for delirium was investigated. The aim of these studies was to find a valid and easy-to-use tool to screen for postoperative delirium on the surgical ward. The early detection and prevention of postoperative delirium and confusion have become an important issue in surgical ward management. The NEECHAM Confusion Scale has been shown to discriminate for delirium and has been used in conjunction with other assessment methods, such as the Confusion Assessment Method and the Memorial Delirium Assessment Scale, to assess the incidence and severity of delirium.","use of neecham scaling enabled medical staff to identify cases of possible confusion early, indicating that the neecham confusion scale should be useful for the detection of postoperative delirium and confusion in the surgical ward.  with the aim of determining an objective technique for early detection of delirium, 64 patients admitted to a surgical ward before surgery were examined using the neecham confusion scale.  postoperative delirium was assessed with the confusion assessment method (cam) adapted for the intensive care unit and the conventional cam accompanied by chart review.  this study compares two screening tools  with a dsm-iv-based diagnosis of delirium, conducted by neuropsychiatric examination in postoperative settings.  the trends of the neecham scores in the 3 groups were compared, and the relationship between the neecham scores and suspected clinical risk factors for delirium was investigated.  delirium status of surgical patients was evaluated postoperatively at the time of admission to the intensive care unit (icu) using the confusion assessment method (cam-icu) scale.  postoperative delirium was detected via confusion assessment method or chart review on postoperative days 1 to 5.  the confusion assessment method and memorial delirium assessment scale were administrated before surgery, and on the first, second and fourth days after surgery, to assess the incidence and severity of the delirium, respectively.  the aim of this study was to find a valid and easy-to-use tool to screen for postoperative delirium on the surgical ward.  the early detection and prevention of postoperative delirium and confusion has become an important issue in surgical ward management.  delirium was assessed by the confusion-assessment-method for the intensive care unit (cam-icu) on the first three days after surgery.  this study adds to the body of knowledge that neecham discriminates for delirium.  following surgery, delirium was assessed throughout icu stay using the confusion assessment method for icu delirium and the richmond agitation and sedation scale.  postoperative delirium is an important problem in patients undergoing major surgery.  the aim of the present study was to assess the validity and predictive value of the neecham confusion scale.  a systematic screening tool identifies postoperative delirium with improved prediction of poor 1-year functional survival following cardiac surgery.  we hypothesized that the nsqip risk calculation for serious complications (nsqip-sc) or risk of death (nsqip-d), and cognitive tests of executive function (trail making tests a and b ), would be predictive of postoperative delirium severity.  postoperative delirium is associated with adverse outcome.  delirium screening was performed daily until the sixth postoperative day using the confusion assessment method (cam), the nursing delirium screening scale (nu-desc), and the delirium detection score (dds), and the dsm-iv criteria as the gold standard.  postoperative delirium in the elderly is common and associated with poor outcomes, but often goes unrecognized. ||| ",Yes
Is the protein β1-integrin recycled?,Yes,"The protein β1-integrin undergoes a process of endocytosis and recycling, as evidenced by its internalization upon ligand binding, trafficking to early endosomes, and return to the plasma membrane through recycling endosomes. This process is facilitated by proteins such as rabgap1, which attenuates rab11 activity, and is implicated in various cellular activities including differentiation, migration, proliferation, wound repair, tissue development, and organogenesis. The recycling of β1-integrin is distinct from that of other integrins, such as α3β1 and α6β1, and is regulated by endocytic recycling. The importance of endocytic recycling of β1-integrin and its regulatory mechanism are still being explored.","some integrins, including beta1 integrins, are known to undergo constitutive endocytosis and recycling.  pathways selectively regulating β1-integrin recycling are implicated in cancer invasion and metastasis, yet proteins required for the internalization of this pro-invasive integrin remain to be identified.  functionally, rabgap1 facilitates active β1 integrin recycling to the plasma membrane through attenuation of rab11 activity.  here we assign a pivotal role for rabgap1 (gapcena) in the recycling of endocytosed active β1 integrins to the plasma membrane.  β1 integrins share the rab11 recycling machinery, but the trafficking of α3β1 and α6β1 are distinct by an unknown mechanism.  upon ligand binding in various cells, the β1 integrin is internalized, traffics to early endosomes, and is returned to the plasma membrane through recycling endosomes.  the laminin-binding integrins, α3β1 and α6β1, are needed for tumor metastasis and their surface expression is regulated by endocytic recycling.  upon continuous ligand stimulation, β1-ar is internalized and mostly recycled back to the plasma membrane (pm).  taken together, these data demonstrate that α6β1 is distinct from α3β1 via rab11-fip5 recycling and recycles in an unexpected cell-cell location.implications: rab11-fip5-dependent α6β1 integrin recycling may be selectively targeted to limit migration of prostate cancer cells into laminin-rich tissues.  rab11-fip5 and its membrane-binding domain were required for α6β1 recycling, without affecting the other laminin-binding integrin (i.e., α3β1) or unrelated membrane receptors like cd44, transferrin receptor, or e-cadherin.  despite the established role of integrin β4 (itg β4) in breast cancer progression, the importance of endocytic recycling of itg β4 and its regulatory mechanism are poorly understood.  the beta1 integrin is a well-known regulator of beta cell activities; however, little is known of its associated alpha subunits.  integrin endocytosis/recycling has been implicated in the regulation of cell migration.  integrin β1 is known to be involved in differentiation, migration, proliferation, wound repair, tissue development, and organogenesis.  in this study, we examine the endocytic recycling of integrin beta1, a process that has been suggested to play an important role during cell motility by mediating the redistribution of integrins to the migrating front.  our data demonstrate that α5 integrin turnover is dependent on fibronectin matrix assembly, where the absence of matrix-capable fibronectin in the extracellular space targets the internalized receptor for rapid degradation.  combined with functional data, the structure reveals a new mechanism of filamin-mediated retention of inactive integrin, suggesting a new framework for understanding regulation of integrin activation and adhesion.  further, we show that ubiquitination and degradation of internalized α5 integrin in the absence of fibronectin require the presence of two specific lysine residues in the α5 cytoplasmic tail.  these results suggest that beta1 integrin conformation can be regulated by conserved cytosolic interactions involving beta cytoplasmic domains.  here, we investigate the biological relevance of beta1 integrin endocytosis to fibronectin matrix turnover. ||| ",Yes

Furthermore, CNEs are frequently found near ""developmental"" genes, particularly transcription factors, implying that these elements have essential regulatory roles in development.

Are CpG islands located close to housekeeping genes?,Yes,"CpG islands are often located in close proximity to the transcription start sites (TSS) of housekeeping genes. These islands are GC-rich regions that are enriched in the CpG dinucleotide repeat and are present in association with all housekeeping genes as well as some tissue-specific genes in the mammalian genome. CpG islands play a crucial role in protecting adjacent housekeeping genes from de novo DNA methylation and in maintaining their transcriptionally active state. The promoters of these genes are known to contain CpG islands, and the transcription regulation of about half of human genes, mostly housekeeping genes, involves CpG islands and their methylation states. The frequency of specific DNA motifs within CpG islands can accurately predict housekeeping promoters, suggesting that these motifs are critical for CpG island function.","it has been envisaged that cpg islands are often observed near the transcriptional start sites (tss) of housekeeping genes.  all housekeeping, but also a substantial minority of tissue-specific genes are associated with the cpg islands.  cpg islands are gc-rich regions located in the promoter regions of housekeeping genes and many tissue-specific genes.  in housekeeping and many tissue-specific genes, the promoter is embedded in a so-called cpg island.  cpg islands are stretches of dna sequence that are enriched in the (cpg)n repeat and are present in close association with all housekeeping genes as well as some tissue-specific genes in the mammalian genome.  cpg islands are important in the protection of adjacent housekeeping genes from de novo dna methylation and for keeping them in a transcriptionally active state.  limited experimental evidence suggests that cpg islands are associated with promoters or replication origins active during early development.  cpg islands (cgis) are cg-rich stretches in the genome that are concentrated near the transcription start sites (tss) of genes.  by reviewing previous cpg-related studies, we consider that the transcription regulation of about half of the human genes, mostly housekeeping (hk) genes, involves cpg islands (cgis), their methylation states, cpg spacing and other chromosomal parameters.  : cpg dinucleotide clusters also referred to as cpg islands (cgis) are usually located in the promoter regions of genes in a deoxyribonucleic acid (dna) sequence.  cpg islands (cgis) are compositionally defined short genomic stretches, which have been studied in the human, mouse, chicken and later in several other genomes.  cpg islands (cgis) are cpg-rich regions compared to cpg-depleted bulk dna of mammalian genomes and are generally regarded as the epigenetic regulatory regions in association with unmethylation, promoter activity and histone modifications.  these results provide strong support for previous speculations that early embryonic expression is associated with cpg islands.  although the promoters of these genes are known to contain cpg islands, the specific dna sequences that are associated with high rnap binding to housekeeping promoters has not been described.  regions with abundant gc nucleotides, a high cpg number, and a length greater than 200 bp in a genome are often referred to as cpg islands.  our results are consistent with previous finding of cpg islands in proximity to active but not inactive proviruses and support further investigation of the protection of the gene transfer vectors from dna methylation.  the frequency of these six dna motifs can predict housekeeping promoters as accurately as the presence of a cpg island, suggesting that they are the structural elements critical for cpg island function.  clusters of cpg at the alpha 1 and alpha 2 genes resemble the 'hpaii tiny fragment (htf) islands' that are characteristic of mammalian 'housekeeping' genes: cpg frequency is not suppressed; testable cpgs are not methylated in dna from erythroid or nonerythroid tissues, although flanking cpgs are methylated; cpg clusters are approximately 1.5 kb long and extend both upstream and downstream of the alpha-globin transcription start site.  cpg islands, which are clusters of cpg dinucleotides in gc-rich regions, are considered gene markers and represent an important feature of mammalian genomes.  interestingly, accumulation of cpg islands at tss appears to be a vertebrate specific genomic feature, which implicates a link between cpg islands and evolution. ||| ",Yes
Do RNA:DNA hybrids preferentially form in high or low GC regions?,Yes,"GC regions

     Justification: The context indicates that GC-rich sequences prefer stem-loop structures, and GC skew favors R-loops, which are a type of RNA:DNA hybrid. Previous studies have shown that GC skew is prevalent at thousands of human CpG island promoters and transcription termination regions, which correspond to hotspots of R-loop formation. This suggests that RNA:DNA hybrids preferentially form in high GC regions.","rna:dna hybrids form when nascent transcripts anneal to the dna template strand or any homologous dna region.  g-rich tracts of rna form g-quadruplexes, while gc-rich sequences prefer stem-loop structures.  gc skew favors r-loops, a type of three stranded nucleic acid structures that form upon annealing of an rna strand to one strand of dna, creating a persistent rna:dna hybrid.  hybridization of rna to its template dna strand during transcription induces formation of r-loops-rna:dna hybrids with unpaired non-template dna strands.  single-stranded guanine-rich rna sequences have a propensity to fold into compact g-quadruplexes (rg4s).  knowledge of the relative stabilities of s-dna.rna hybrids of different sequences is important for choosing rna targets for hybridization with antisense phosphorothioate oligodeoxyribonucleotides (s-dnas).  cd spectra of s-dna.rna hybrids were sequence-dependent and were similar to those of analogous unmodified hybrids.  in general, sequence-dependent cd spectra and tm values of s-dna.rna hybrids appear to reflect the unique nearest-neighbor interactions of adjacent base pairs, where the s-dna and rna strands are in different, but relatively uniform, conformations.  the s-dna.rna hybrids had a sequence-dependence of melting temperatures that was approximately the same as that calculated using published data for normal dna.rna hybrids .  previous studies show that gc skew is prevalent at thousands of human cpg island (cgi) promoters and transcription termination regions, which correspond to hotspots of r-loop formation.  when denatured, the rna sequences that form the double-stranded regions hybridize rapidly to hela cell dna, suggesting that they are transcribed from reiterated sites in the genome.  the equilibrium between alternate structures within rna may occur and influence its functionality.  rna and dna adopt different types of conformations, i.e., a-type with c3'-endo sugar pucker for rna and b-type with c2'-endo sugar pucker for dna, respectively.  guanine-rich sequences are able to form complex rna structures termed rna g-quadruplexes in vitro.  a dark side of the matter is that rna:dna hybrids are also a cause of dna damage and human diseases.  heterogeneous nuclear rna from hela cells contains double-stranded regions that arise by base pairing of complementary sequences that exist as parts of the same molecule (intramolecular base pairing).  transient association of guanine-rich rna and dna in the form of hetero-g-quadruplexes (rdqs) has emerged as an important mechanism for regulating genome transcription and replication but relatively little is known about the structure and biophysical properties of rdqs compared with dna and rna homo-g-quadruplexes.  furthermore, we reveal that promoter gc skew peaks at the exon 1/ intron1 junction and that it is highly correlated with gene age and cgi promoter strength.  using rg4-seq, we profile the landscape of those guanine-rich regions with the in vitro folding potential in the arabidopsis transcriptome.  circular dichroism (cd) spectra and melting temperatures were acquired for 16 hybrid sequences that could be formed by mixing s-dna and rna oligomers of 24 nucleotides in length. ||| ",Yes
Are ACTA1 (alpha actin) and NEB (nebulin) genes related to nemaline myopathy?,Yes,"Justification: The context indicates that mutations in the ACTA1 gene, which encodes skeletal α-actin, are a frequent cause of nemaline myopathy (NM). Additionally, it is demonstrated that nebulin, encoded by the NEB gene, can appear abnormal secondary to a primary defect in actin in NM patients. The context also mentions that NM is caused by mutations in various genes, including NEB and ACTA1. Therefore, it can be concluded that both ACTA1 and NEB genes are related to nemaline myopathy.","we have studied a cohort of nemaline myopathy (nm) patients with mutations in the muscle alpha-skeletal actin gene (acta1).  many mutations in the skeletal muscle α-actin gene (acta1) lead to muscle weakness and nemaline myopathy.  nemaline myopathy is the most common congenital myopathy and is caused by mutations in various genes such as acta1 (encoding skeletal α-actin).  we propose that altered serum-response factor signalling could be a major factor in actin-based nemaline myopathy, and that this area could be exploited to develop therapies for sufferers.  nemaline myopathy (nm), the most common non-dystrophic congenital disease of skeletal muscle, can be caused by mutations in the skeletal muscle α-actin gene (acta1) (~25% of all nm cases and up to 50% of severe forms of nm).  nemaline myopathy is a neuromuscular disorder, characterized by muscle weakness and hypotonia and is, in 20% of the cases, caused by mutations in the gene encoding alpha-skeletal muscle actin, acta1.  nemaline myopathy (nem) is a neuromuscular disorder characterized by the presence, in skeletal muscle, of nemaline rods composed at least in part of alpha-actinin.  about 20 % of nemaline myopathies are thus far related to skeletal muscle alpha-actin.  nemaline myopathy (nm) is the most common congenital myopathy and is caused by mutations in various genes including neb (nebulin), tpm2 (beta-tropomyosin), tpm3 (gamma-tropomyosin), and acta1 (skeletal alpha-actin).  acta1 mutations are responsible of several muscle disorders including nemaline, cores, actin aggregate myopathies and fiber-type disproportion.  nemaline myopathy is a muscular wasting disease similar to muscular dystrophy, but distinguished by deposits of actin and actin-associated proteins near the z-line of the sarcomere.  nemaline myopathy with intranuclear rods is a rare variant of nemaline myopathy, due in almost all instances to mutation of acta1, the gene encoding skeletal muscle alpha-actin.  nemaline myopathy is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous muscle disorder.  we demonstrate that nebulin can appear abnormal secondary to a primary defect in actin, and show by isoelectric focusing that mutant actin isoforms are present within insoluble actin filaments isolated from muscle from two acta1 nm patients.  to unravel the potential mechanisms involved, we dissected lower limb and diaphragm muscles from a knock-in mouse model of severe nemaline myopathy expressing the acta1 his40tyr actin mutation found in human patients.  we conducted the same biochemical experiments for twelve new actin mutants associated with nemaline myopathy.  mutations in acta1 are a frequent cause of nm (ie, nem3).  our results confirm that nm associated alpha-actin mutations induce a range of defects at the biochemical level as well as in cultured fibroblasts and muscle cells.  nemaline myopathy (nm) is one of the most common congenital nondystrophic myopathies and is characterized by muscle weakness, often from birth.  therefore, in the present study, we aimed at unraveling these mechanisms using muscles from a transgenic mouse model of nemaline myopathy expressing the acta1 asp286gly mutation. ||| ",Yes
Does Jarid2 play a role in early embryo development?,Yes,"Jarid2 plays a significant role in early embryonic development, as evidenced by its regulation of the methylation level of H3K27me3, a process closely linked to normal early embryonic development. Jarid2, a member of the Jumonji demethylase protein family, functions as a regulator of early embryonic development and can regulate mouse development and embryonic stem cell differentiation by modifying histone lysines. The expression pattern of Jarid2 in bovine oocytes and at each early embryonic stage has been identified, and the results suggest that Jarid2 plays a key role in early embryonic development by regulating the expression of Oct4, Sox2, and c-Myc via modification of H3K27me3 expression.","jarid2 can affect early embryonic development by regulating the methylation level of h3k27me3, which is closely related to normal early embryonic development.  jarid2, which is a member of the jumonji demethylase protein family, is a regulator of early embryonic development and can regulate mouse development and embryonic stem cell (esc) differentiation by modifying histone lysines.  however, jarid2 has also been shown to exert pleiotropic prc2-independent actions during embryogenesis.  in summary, the present study identified the expression pattern of jarid2 in bovine oocytes and at each early embryonic stage, and the results suggest that jarid2 plays a key role in early embryonic development by regulating the expression of oct4, sox2 and c-myc via modification of h3k27me3 expression.  jumonij (jmj)/jarid2 plays important roles in embryonic development and functions as a transcriptional repressor.  here, we have investigated the role of jarid2 during pancreas development.  therefore, our study provides new mechanistic insights into epigenetic regulation by jarid2, which will enhance our understanding of the molecular basis of other organ development and biological processes.  jarid2/jumonji critically regulates developmental processes including cardiovascular development.  thus, our study identifies jarid2 as a fine-tuner of gene expression during late stages of pancreatic endocrine cell development.  jarid2 is a component of the polycomb repressor complex 2 (prc2), which is responsible for genome-wide h3k27me3 deposition, in embryonic stem cells.  inactivation of jarid2 in endocrine progenitors demonstrates that jarid2 functions after endocrine specification.  jarid2 is an accessory component of polycomb repressive complex-2 (prc2) required for the differentiation of embryonic stem cells (escs).  a role for jarid2 in the recruitment of prc2 to target genes silenced during differentiation has been put forward, but the molecular details remain unclear.  we next detected the mrna expression levels of embryonic development-related genes (oct4, sox2 and c-myc) after jarid2 knockdown through jarid2-2830-sirna microinjection to investigate the molecularpathwayunderlying the regulation of h3k27me3 by jarid2 during early embryonic development.  here, we show that deletion of jarid2 in mouse epidermis reduces the proliferation and potentiates the differentiation of postnatal epidermal progenitors, without affecting epidermal development.  the results showed that the relative expression levels of these genes in 2-cell embryos weresignificantly higher than those in the blastocyst stage, and expression levels were significantly increased after jarid2 knockdown.  the results showed that jarid2 is highly expressed in the germinal vesicle (gv), mii, 2-cell, 4-cell, 8-cell, 16-cell and blastocyst stages, but the relative expression level of jarid2 in bovine gv oocytes is significantly lower than that at other oocyte/embryonic stages (p < 0.05), and jarid2 is expressed primarily in the nucleus.  jarid2 was recently identified as an important component of the mammalian polycomb repressive complex 2 (prc2), where it has a major effect on prc2 recruitment in mouse embryonic stem cells.  the identification of jarid2 as a potential regulator of notch1 signaling has broad implications for many cellular processes including development, stem cell maintenance, and tumor formation.  to investigate the expression pattern of jarid2 and the effect of jarid2-induced h3k27 methylation in bovine oocytes and early embryonic stages, jarid2 mrna expression and localization were detected in bovine oocytes and early embryos via qrt-pcr and immunofluorescence in the present study. ||| ",Yes
Is Calcium/Calmodulin dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) involved in cardiac arrhythmias and heart failure?,Yes,"Calcium/Calmodulin dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) has been identified as a key enzyme in various cardiac pathologies, including heart failure (HF), myocardial infarction, and cardiomyopathies. The activation of CaMKII in HF can contribute to arrhythmias induced by β-adrenergic receptor-mediated sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium leak. Excessive activation of CaMKII has been linked to arrhythmias and heart failure, although the specific cellular mechanisms remain uncertain. The predominant isoform of CaMKII in the heart, CaMKIIδ, is an important regulator of cardiac electrophysiology, calcium balance, contraction, and transcription, and has been implicated in the progression of pathological remodeling. Dysfunction in the CaMKII signaling pathway is associated with increased susceptibility to life-threatening arrhythmias in heart disease.","in the recent years, ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase ii (camkii) was suggested to be associated with cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure but also with arrhythmias both in animal models as well as in the human heart.  calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase ii (camkii) has emerged as key enzyme in many cardiac pathologies, especially heart failure (hf), myocardial infarction and cardiomyopathies, thus leading to contractile dysfunction and malignant arrhythmias.  calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase ii (camkii) is activated in heart failure (hf) and can contribute to arrhythmias induced by β-adrenergic receptor-mediated sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium leak.  calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase ii (camkii) has been implicated in the transduction of calcium signals in the heart, but the specific isoforms of camkii that mediate pathological cardiac signaling have not been fully defined.  activation of ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase ii (camkii) is established as a central intracellular trigger for various cardiac pathologies such as hypertrophy, heart failure or arrhythmias in animals and humans suggesting camkii as a promising target protein for future medical treatments.  the multifunctional ca(2+)- and calmodulin-dependent protein kinase ii (camkii) is a crucial mediator of cardiac physiology and pathology.  the multifunctional ca(2+)/calmodulin (cam)-dependent protein kinase ii (camkii) has emerged as a proarrhythmic and procardiomyopathic signal in a wide range of structural heart diseases.  excessive activation of calmodulin kinase ii (camkii) causes arrhythmias and heart failure, but the cellular mechanisms for camkii-targeted proteins causing disordered cell membrane excitability and myocardial dysfunction remain uncertain.  calcium-calmodulin dependent protein kinase iiδ (camkiiδ) is an important regulator of cardiac electrophysiology, calcium (ca) balance, contraction, transcription, arrhythmias and progression to heart failure.  calcium-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase ii (camkii) has emerged as a central mediator of cardiac stress responses which may serve several critical roles in the regulation of cardiac rhythm, cardiac contractility and growth.  calmodulin kinase ii (camkii) mediates critical signaling pathways responsible for divergent functions in the heart including calcium cycling, hypertrophy and apoptosis.  although ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase-ii (camk) is known to phosphorylate different ca(2+) cycling proteins in the cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum (sr) and regulate its function, the status of camk in heart failure has not been investigated previously.  ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase ii (camkii) has been implicated in the regulation of cardiac excitation-contraction coupling (ecc) as well as in apoptotic signaling and adverse remodeling.  calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase ii (camkii) is a multifunctional serine/threonine kinase expressed abundantly in the heart.  calmodulin-dependent protein kinase ii (camkii) has been proposed to be a therapeutic target for heart failure (hf).  camkii targets numerous proteins involved in excitation-contraction coupling and excitability, and its activation may simultaneously contribute to heart failure and cardiac arrhythmias.  ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase ii (camkii) is an enzyme with important regulatory functions in the heart and brain, and its chronic activation can be pathological.  calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase type ii delta (camkiiδ), the predominant camkii isoform expressed in the heart, has been implicated in the progression of myocardial infarction- and pressure overload-induced pathological remodeling.  dysfunction in the camkii signaling pathway occurs in heart disease and is associated with increased susceptibility to life-threatening arrhythmia.  increased expression and activation of camkii has been linked to elevated risk for arrhythmic events and is a hallmark of human heart failure. ||| ",Yes
Does smoking increase risk for glioblastoma?,Yes,"The present study provides evidence for a positive association between cigarette smoking and risk of glioma. Compared with nonsmokers, duration of cigarette smoking, number of cigarettes smoked per day, and pack-years of smoking were associated with increased glioma risk. After adjustment for confounders, smoking increased the risk of glioma deaths by 11%. For individuals aged 50 years or older, smoking was associated with a 25% higher risk of glioma death. Among women who reported having quit smoking, a 51% increase in risk of glioma was observed compared with never smokers. However, current smokers did not appear to have an increase in risk. These findings provide strong evidence that cigarette smoking is associated with an increased risk of glioma.","the present study provides some support for a positive association between cigarette smoking and risk of glioma.  on this basis, it has been hypothesized that cigarette smoking may be associated with an increased risk of glioma.  compared with nonsmokers, duration of cigarette smoking, number of cigarettes smoked per day and pack-years of smoking were associated with increased glioma risk, although the increases in risk were relatively modest.  however, two recent cohort studies showed increased risks of glioma among smokers.  after adjustment for confounders, smoking increased the risk of glioma deaths by 11% (odds ratio  = 1.11; 95% confidence interval : 1.03-1.21).  for individuals aged ≥ 50 years, smoking was associated with higher risk of glioma death by 25% (or = 1.25; 95% ci: 1.15-1.38); this increased risk for smokers who smoked ≥ 20 cigarettes daily for ≥ 30 years was 53% (or = 1.53; 95% ci: 1.34-1.74).  we prospectively examined the relation between cigarette smoking and glioma risk among men and women in three large u.s. cohort studies: the health professionals follow-up study (hpfs), the nurses' health study i (nhs), and nhs ii.  although cigarette smoking and alcohol drinking increase the risk of several cancers and certain components of cigarette smoke and alcohol can penetrate the blood-brain barrier, it remains unclear whether these exposures influence the risk of glioma.  this study indicates that smoking is associated with glioma deaths in the chinese population.  we investigated the association between cigarette smoking and glioma risk in the national breast screening study, which included 89,835 canadian women aged 40-59 years at recruitment between 1980 and 1985.  smoking increases the risk of numerous cancers; however, an association of smoking with adult gliomas has not been found in a population.  we examined the associations between cigarette smoking, alcohol intake, and risk of glioma in the national institutes of health-aarp diet and health study, a prospective study of 477,095 us men and women ages 50-71 years at baseline.  among men, current, heavier smoking was associated with a reduced risk of glioma compared with never smoking, but this was based on only nine cases.  among ever smokers, women who reported having quit smoking had a 51% increase in risk of glioma compared with never smokers (hr = 1.51, 95% ci = 0.97-2.34), while current smokers did not appear to have an increase in risk.  when the association with former smokers was further examined by years since quitting, women who had quit smoking >10 years before baseline were at a decreased risk of glioma compared with women who had quit within the 10 years prior to baseline (hr = 0.55, 95% ci = 0.29-1.07), indicating that the association between former smokers and glioma may be driven by women, who recently quit smoking.  cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate incidence rate ratios and 95% confidence intervals between smoking and glioma risk adjusting for age, total meat intake, and alcohol and coffee consumption.  these findings provide strong evidence that cigarette smoking is not associated with an appreciably elevated risk of adult glioma.  cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate hazard ratios (hrs) and 95% confidence intervals (cis) for the association between cigarette smoking and risk of glioma.  we quantified the association between smoking and glioma through a meta-analysis of the literature.  our results demonstrate that cigarette smoking significantly increases lung cancer risk in carriers of a germline p53 mutation. ||| ",No
Can Logic Alignment Free (LAF) be used for bacterial genomes classification?,Yes,"Logic Alignment Free (LAF) has been successfully applied to the classification of bacterial genomes to their corresponding taxonomy. LAF is a method that combines alignment-free techniques and rule-based classification algorithms to assign biological samples to their taxa. Alignment-free algorithms are used to estimate the similarity of biological sequences and are often applied to the phylogenetic reconstruction of genomes. LAF is practical for genome-scale data and does not require pre-existing sequence clustering, making it suitable for bacterial genome and metagenome researchers. The effectiveness of LAF in identifying the signal of each class is suggested by the negligible impact of state-of-the-art methods to adjust the frequency of k-mers on classification performance. Machine learning techniques have also been shown to improve bacterial species classification based on fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) data.","we apply laf successfully to the classification of bacterial genomes to their corresponding taxonomy.  in this paper, we present logic alignment free (laf), a method that combines alignment-free techniques and rule-based classification algorithms in order to assign biological samples to their taxa.  we present a clustering-free approach to multi-sample illumina data sets that can identify independent bacterial subpopulations regardless of the similarity of their 16s tag sequences.  alignment-free algorithms can be used to estimate the similarity of biological sequences and hence are often applied to the phylogenetic reconstruction of genomes.  although gene-finding in bacterial genomes is relatively straightforward, the automated assignment of gene function is still challenging, resulting in a vast quantity of hypothetical sequences of unknown function.  sequence analysis of the 16s rrna gene represents a highly accurate and versatile method for bacterial classification and identification, even when the species in question is notoriously difficult to identify by phenotypic means.  here, we present a new web program, micheck (microbial genome checker), that enables rapid verification of sets of annotated genes and frameshifts in previously published bacterial genomes.  fame-based bacterial species classification is successfully evaluated in a taxonomic framework.  we present an automated method for the functional annotation of bacterial protein sequences.  state of the art methods to adjust the frequency of k-mers to the character distribution of the underlying genomes have negligible impact on classification performance, suggesting that the signal of each class is strong and that laf is effective in identifying it.  machine learning techniques have shown to improve bacterial species classification based on fatty acid methyl ester (fame) data.  it is practical for genome-scale data and does not require pre-existing sequence clustering; thus, this method suits the needs of bacterial genome and metagenome researchers.  the annotation process of a newly sequenced bacterial genome is largely based on algorithms derived from databases of previously defined rna and protein-encoding gene structures.  a computer program was developed to identify anaerobic bacteria by using simultaneous pattern recognition via a bayesian probabilistic model.  summarized, by phylogenetic learning we are able to situate and evaluate fame-based bacterial species classification in a more informative context.  this approach has become popular in bacterial genomics because it is one of the few methods that is practical for large datasets and because it does not require additional functional genomics experiments.  automated function prediction has played a central role in determining the biological functions of bacterial proteins.  blannotator is an accurate method for bacterial protein function prediction.  computational approaches that link bacterial 16s rrna gene amplicon data to functional genes based on prokaryotic reference genomes have emerged.  here we report on an r package for genome-wide association studies of orthologous genes in bacteria. ||| ",Yes
Does HER2 under-expression lead to favorable response to trastuzumab?,No,"The context suggests that HER2 overexpression is associated with better response to treatment with trastuzumab. The study reveals that engagement of immune effector cells by trastuzumab induces HER2 downregulation in HER2-expressing cancer cells, which serves as a novel mechanism of action for trastuzumab. The results imply that HER2 downregulation in cancer cells treated by trastuzumab may predict active engagement of immune effector cells in the tumor microenvironment. However, the context does not provide evidence that HER2 under-expression leads to a favorable response to trastuzumab.","we aimed to investigate whether her2 positivity was still associated with worse outcome in high-risk estrogen receptor (er) positive patients treated with trastuzumab and chemotherapy.  the aim of this study is to investigate if the dependence of trastuzumab-mediated cancer cell her2 downregulation on immune effector cells represents a novel mechanism of action for trastuzumab.  furthermore, her2 downregulation in cancer cells induced by trastuzumab engagement of immune cells was correlated with the antibody's antitumor efficacy in vivo.  we further demonstrated that her2 downregulation in cancer cells by immune-cell-engaged trastuzumab was at the transcriptional level, not through the her2 degradation pathway.  despite selection based on human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (her2) overexpression, not all her2-positive patients benefit from trastuzumab therapy.  the her2 transmembrane receptor is a well-characterised predictive marker for trastuzumab benefit and may be associated with decreased benefit from endocrine therapy use.  this study reveals that engagement of immune effector cells by trastuzumab induces her2 downregulation in her2-expressing cancer cells, which represents a new function of immune cells in trastuzumab-mediated antitumor efficacy and serves as a novel mechanism of action for trastuzumab.  our results imply that her2 downregulation in cancer cells treated by trastuzumab may predict active engagement of immune effector cells in tumor microenvironment.  her2/neu (erbb-2) overexpression, which occurs in 15-20% of breast cancer cases, is associated with better response to treatment with the drug trastuzumab.  her2 downregulation of cancer cells by trastuzumab occurred only when trastuzumab was actively engaged with immune cells and cancer cells, as demonstrated consistently in co-cultures of cancer cell lines with pbmcs and in vivo mouse xenograft tumor models.  trastuzumab, which is a monoclonal antibody to her-2, is an effective treatment in some women with breast carcinomas that overexpress her-2, as demonstrated by immunohistochemistry.  we here show that the antitumor activity of  trastuzumab deruxtecan is dependent on the expression level of her2 protein in colorectal cancer (crc) cell lines negative for her2 amplification.  although amplification of the gene encoding human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (her2) is used as an indicator for response to trastuzumab, the reported response rate is low, and few patients with gastric cancer (gc) benefit from this individualized therapy.  our results thus suggest that  trastuzumab deruxtecan warrants further study as a potential treatment for crc tumors that express her2 protein in the absence of her2 amplification.  single-agent trastuzumab did not exhibit significant clinical activity against nonsmall cell lung carcinoma when her-2 expression levels were measured by immunohistochemistry.  co-expression of human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (her2) and hormone receptor (hr) predicted worse prognosis in early breast cancer before trastuzumab was developed.  furthermore, nuclear her4 predicted poor clinical response to trastuzumab monotherapy in patients undergoing a window study and was shown to be an independent poor prognostic factor in her2 positive breast cancer.  her2 expression was evaluated by western blotting, flow cytometry, and real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr) in cell lysates from co-cultures of multiple cancer cell lines with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs) in the presence or absence of trastuzumab.  the objective of this phase ii study was to determine whether trastuzumab would effect responses in patients with nonsmall cell lung carcinoma who had tumors that overexpressed her-2.  our data suggest that her4 plays a key role in relation to trastuzumab resistance in her2 positive breast cancer. ||| ",No
Are there any urine biomarkers for chronic kidney disease?,Yes,"The context suggests that there are several urine biomarkers for chronic kidney disease (CKD). These include urinary proteomic analyses, which have shown high diagnostic accuracy for CKD, including hypertensive nephropathy, and improved identification of patients with rapid kidney function decline beyond albuminuria testing. Urinary levels of NGAL, a marker of renal tubular injury, have been associated with future ischemic atherosclerotic events in patients with CKD. Urinary nephrin is also a potential non-invasive biomarker of disease. Additionally, urinary cystatin C (u-CysC) is a new biomarker for acute tubular kidney dysfunction and may also indicate chronic tubular dysfunction. The protein:creatinine ratio in spot morning urine samples is a precise indicator of proteinuria and a reliable predictor of progression of disease in non-diabetic patients with chronic nephropathies. The urinary nephrin-to-creatinine ratio level is also a useful and reliable biomarker for predicting the amelioration of podocyte dysfunction by candidate drugs in various kidney disease models with podocyte dysfunction.","the contrast between a high prevalence of chronic kidney disease (ckd) and the low incidence of end-stage renal disease highlights the need for new biomarkers of progression beyond albuminuria testing.  urine is a source of potential markers of disease.  diagnosis of kidney disease is currently and primarily based on the measurement of serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, and urine output, and most kidney diseases with elevated serum creatinine accompany abnormal findings of urinalysis with microscopy, such as proteinuria or hematuria.  noninvasive molecular tests of urine cells have been developed to monitor the activity of kidney diseases.  urinary proteomic analyses had a high diagnostic accuracy for ckd, including hypertensive nephropathy, and strongly improved identification of patients with rapid kidney function decline beyond albuminuria testing.  in the context of renal disease, urine is particularly important as it may directly reflect kidney injury.  however, there are no established markers for early diagnosis or predicting renal prognosis.  current markers of renal dysfunction lack both optimal specificity and sensitivity, and improved technologies and approaches are needed.  among patients with chronic kidney disease, urine levels of ngal, a marker of renal tubular injury, were associated independently with future ischemic atherosclerotic events, but not with heart failure events or deaths.  urinary nephrin is a potential non-invasive biomarker of disease.  kidney tubular atrophy on biopsy is a strong predictor of chronic kidney disease (ckd) progression, but tubular health is poorly quantified by traditional measures including estimated glomerular filtration rate (egfr) and albuminuria.  renal interstitial fibrosis and arterial lesions predict loss of function in chronic kidney disease.  urinary proteomics is a promising method, but more studies focusing on progression rate and patients with hypertensive nephropathy are needed.  biomarkers of early stage ckd and prognostic biomarkers are required.  chronic kidney disease (ckd) is an increasing clinical problem.  urinary cystatin c (u-cysc) is a new biomarker for acute tubular kidney dysfunction and may also indicate chronic tubular dysfunction.  protein:creatinine ratio in spot morning urine samples is a precise indicator of proteinuria and a reliable predictor of progression of disease in non-diabetic patients with chronic nephropathies and represents a simple and inexpensive procedure in establishing severity of renal disease and prognosis.  in conclusion, these results suggest that urinary nephrin-to-creatinine ratio level is a useful and reliable biomarker for predicting the amelioration of podocyte dysfunction by candidate drugs in various kidney disease models with podocyte dysfunction.  although clinical risk factors and biomarkers for the development and progression of ckd have been identified, there is no commercial surveillance technology to definitively diagnose and quantify the severity and progressive loss of glomerular filtration rate (gfr) in ckd.  we review the major findings in urinary proteomics in ckd during the last five years. ||| ",Yes
Is the Wnt protein modified by notum?,Yes,"The Wnt protein is indeed modified by notum, a secreted member of the α/β-hydrolase superfamily. Notum hydrolyzes the palmitoleoylate modification on Wnt proteins, thereby disrupting Wnt signaling. This process results in the formation of inactivated Wnt proteins that are unable to bind to their receptors. The Wnt-deacylase activity of notum is the basis of its ability to act as a feedback inhibitor of Wnt signaling. This modification is essential for the Wnt structure to maintain its active monomeric conformation.","notum is a secreted member of the α/β-hydrolase superfamily that hydrolyzes the palmitoleoylate modification on wnt proteins, thereby disrupting wnt signaling.  notum has recently been identified as a negative regulator of wnt signaling through the removal of an essential palmitoleate group from wnt proteins.  notum is a secreted wnt antagonist that belongs to the α/β hydrolase superfamily, but its mechanism of action and roles in vertebrate embryogenesis are not fully understood.  as a secreted inhibitor of wnt, notum presents an attractive molecular target for improving skeletal health.  notum was recently shown to act as a negative regulator of wnt signaling through the removal of an essential palmitoleate group.  indeed, the wnt-deacylase activity of notum is the basis of its ability to act as a feedback inhibitor of wnt signalling.  notum suppressed wnt signaling in cell reporter assays, but surprisingly also enhanced shh signaling independent of effects on wnt.  here, we report that notum hydrolyzes the wnt palmitoleoylate adduct extracellularly, resulting in inactivated wnt proteins that form oxidized oligomers incapable of receptor binding.  thus, notum is a wnt deacylase, and palmitoleoylation is obligatory for the wnt structure that maintains its active monomeric conformation.  secreted wnt proteins play essential roles in many biological processes during development and diseases.  we are investigating the role of notum in modulating wnt signalling in the central nervous system and wished to establish if 1 would serve as a peripherally restricted control.  wnt genes indeed encode secreted molecules, but soluble active wnt protein has not been found.  we present evidence that notum influences wingless protein distribution by modifying the heparan sulfate proteoglycans dally-like and dally.  unexpectedly, a non-wnt ligand for this receptor complex has now been discovered.  wntless also known as wls, gpr177, or evi, is a key modulator of wnt protein secretion.  while it has been suggested that wnt proteins may target cytoskeletal structures more directly, no definitive studies have identified an intracellular association and function for these molecules.  the phenotypes caused by mutations in wnt genes suggest that their gene products are involved in cell-to-cell communication.  notum inhibitors can restore wnt signaling which may be of therapeutic benefit for pathologies such as osteoporosis and alzheimer's disease.  recently, wntless (wls/evi/srt) was identified as a conserved multi-pass transmembrane protein whose function seems to be dedicated to promoting the release of wnts.  wnt5a is a representative wnt ligand that regulates multiple cellular functions through the wnt5a non-classical pathway. ||| ",Yes
Is statin use associated with improved outcomes after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage?,No,"The results of the present systematic review do not lend statistically significant support to the finding of a beneficial effect of statins in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage as reported in a previous meta-analysis.

Can Diabetes be caused by a defect in a potassium chanel?,Yes,"The evidence suggests that low serum potassium concentrations or hypokalemia induced by the intake of diuretics are associated with incident diabetes and increased risk for diabetes in persons with hypertension. Furthermore, low serum potassium concentrations decrease insulin secretion, leading to glucose intolerance, and hypokalemia induced by diuretics increases the risk for diabetes in hypertensive individuals. The role of the kcnq1 protein as a potassium channel that in the pancreatic beta-cells drives an electrical signal that facilitates glucose-stimulated insulin secretion has been identified. Therefore, a defect in a potassium channel could potentially contribute to the development of diabetes.","the diminished insulin secretion of type 2 diabetes might result from abnormal regulation of the potassium permeability which leads to beta-cell depolarization.  we examined a possible association between serum potassium and prediabetes (defined as isolated impaired fasting glucose , isolated impaired glucose tolerance  or combined ifg/igt), as well as known and newly diagnosed diabetes (ndd), in 32- to 81-year-old men and women with and without hypertension.  in the diabetic patient, hyperkalemia and hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis has been attributed to one or more of the following factors associated with diabetic nephropathy: hypoaldosteronism, altered potassium homeostasis, or a distal tubular (dt) defect in hydrogen ion secretion.  background: low potassium has been identified both as a risk factor for type 2 diabetes and as a mediator of the racial disparity in diabetes risk.  this study aimed to investigate whether low serum potassium is associated with increased risk of type 2 diabetes in apparently healthy japanese men.  hypokalemia (low serum potassium level) is a common electrolyte imbalance that can cause a defect in urinary concentrating ability, i.e., nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (ndi), but the molecular mechanism is unknown.  evidence suggests that low serum potassium concentrations or hypokalaemia induced by the intake of diuretics are associated with incident diabetes and increased risk for diabetes in persons with hypertension.  evidence has suggested that low serum potassium concentrations decrease insulin secretion, leading to glucose intolerance, and that hypokalaemia induced by diuretics increases the risk for diabetes in hypertensive individuals.  mild to moderately low serum potassium levels, within the normal range and without frank hypokalaemia, could be predictive of type 2 diabetes in apparently healthy japanese men.  patients with diabetes mellitus (dm) frequently develop electrolyte disorders, including hyperkalemia.  every 0.5 mmol/l lower increment in the baseline serum potassium level was associated with a 45% (12-87%) increased risk of diabetes.  thiazide-induced potassium loss may contribute to new onset diabetes (nod).  this effect is explained by the role of the kcnq1 protein as a potassium channel that in the pancreatic beta-cells drives an electrical signal that facilitates glucose-stimulated insulin secretion.  the lowest tertile of serum potassium (2.8-3.9 mmol/l) was independently associated with the development of diabetes after adjustment for known predictors (hr 1.57 ) compared with the highest tertile (4.2-5.4 mmol/l).  chronic potassium (k+) deficiency has been shown previously to cause a reduction in solute content in the renal papilla, an effect that is potentially important as a contributing factor to the concentrating defect seen in this circumstance.  there were no significant differences in glucose or insulin measures during the ogtt between the 2 groups, but there was a trend for improved insulin sensitivity in potassium-treated participants.conclusions: in this pilot trial, kcl at a dose of 40 meq/d did not increase serum potassium significantly.  the possibility of a generalized defect has been investigated in vitro by the stimulation of 86rb efflux from red cells of type 2 diabetic patients by calcium ionophore and its inhibition by quinine.  serum potassium levels were independently associated with prediabetes and ndd in hypertensive adults from the general population.  these results indicate that the endogenous ketoacidemia and hyperglycemia observed in dka, which result primarily from insulin deficit, are the main determinants of increased p. since exogenous ketoacidemia and hyperglycemia in the otherwise normal experimental animal do not increase p, it is postulated that insulin deficit itself may be the major initiating cause of the hyperkalemia that develops in dka.  cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate hrs for incident diabetes (fasting plasma glucose level ≥ 7.0 mmol/l, hba(1c) ≥ 6.5% or self-reported) including serum potassium concentration as either a categorical or a continuous variable. ||| ",Yes
"Has ""RNA interference"" been awarded Nobel prize?",Yes,"The discovery of RNA interference (RNAi) was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2006. RNAi is a natural process of posttranscriptional gene regulation that has garnered significant attention since its first unequivocal description in 1998.

Are thyroid hormone receptor alpha1 mutations implicated in thyroid hormone resistance syndrome?,Yes,"Thyroid hormone receptor alpha1 (TRα1) mutations are indeed implicated in thyroid hormone resistance syndrome (RTH). This rare and under-recognized genetic disease is caused by mutations in the thyroid hormone receptor alpha (THRA) gene, which encodes TRα1. The disease manifests as tissue-specific hypothyroidism, with circulating thyroid hormone levels exhibiting hypothyroid-like clinical features. Despite this, patients with RTH due to THRA mutations (RTHα) have a raised triiodothyronine/thyroxine ratio and normal thyrotropin levels. The clinical presentation of RTHα is variable and can resemble untreated congenital hypothyroidism.","background: in humans, resistance to thyroid hormone (rth) caused by mutations in the thyroid hormone receptor alpha (thra) gene, rthα, manifests as tissue-specific hypothyroidism and circulating thyroid hormone levels exhibit hypothyroid-like clinical features.  heterozygous mutations in the thyroid hormone receptor alpha (thra) gene cause resistance to thyroid hormone alpha (rthα), a disease characterized by variable manifestations reminiscent of untreated congenital hypothyroidism but a raised triiodothyronine/thyroxine ratio and normal thyrotropin levels.  resistance to thyroid hormone alpha (rthα) is a rare and under-recognized genetic disease caused by mutations of thra, the gene encoding thyroid hormone receptor α1 (trα1).  resistance to thyroid hormone due to thra mutations (rthα) is a recently discovered genetic disease, displaying important variability in its clinical presentation.  mutations of the thyroid hormone receptor beta (trbeta) gene cause resistance to thyroid hormone (rth).  resistance to thyroid hormone syndrome (rth) is an autosomal dominant or recessive genetic disease caused by mutation of either the thyroid hormone receptorβ (thr-β) gene or the thyroid hormone receptorα (thr-α) gene.  mutations in the thyroid hormone receptor beta (tr beta) gene result in tr beta 1 mutants that mediate the clinical phenotype by interfering with transcription of thyroid hormone-regulated genes via a dominant negative effect.  resistance to thyroid hormone alpha (rthα), a disorder characterized by tissue-selective hypothyroidism and near-normal thyroid function tests due to thyroid receptor alpha gene mutations, is rare but probably under-recognized.  about 85% of patients with rth harbor mutations in thyroid hormone receptor  (tr).  activating somatic mutations in the thyrotropin (tsh) receptor have been identified as a cause of hyperfunctioning thyroid adenomas, and germline mutations have been found in familial nonautoimmune hyperthyroidism and sporadic congenital hyperthyroidism.  resistance to thyroid hormone beta (rthβ) is an inherited syndrome caused by mutations in the thyroid hormone receptor β (thrb) gene.  rthα is a recently discovered resistance to thyroid hormone (rth) due to mutation of thra, the gene encoding trα1, the thyroid hormone receptor.  constitutively activating mutations of the thyrotropin (tsh) receptor have been identified as a molecular cause of toxic adenomas, nonautoimmune familial hyperthyroidism, and sporadic congenital hyperthyroidism.  resistance to thyroid hormone (rth) is a rare autosomal hereditary disorder characterized by increased serum thyroid hormone (th) levels with unsuppressed or increased thyrotropin concentration.  patients with mutations in thrb present with resistance to thyroid hormone β (rthβ), which is a disorder characterized by elevated levels of thyroid hormone, normal or elevated levels of tsh and goitre.  thyroid hormone resistance (rth) is a rare autosomal dominant disorder, characterized clinically by goiter and biochemically by elevated circulating free thyroid hormone levels in the presence of measurable serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (tsh) concentrations.  these patients had a clinical syndrome of resistance to th associated with high serum th and nonsuppressed thyroid-stimulating hormone levels.  autosomal dominant non-autoimmune hyperthyroidism is caused by activating tshr germline mutations.  resistance to thyroid hormone (rth) is a clinical syndrome characterized by elevated serum thyroid hormone (th) levels, unsuppressed thyrotropin (tsh) levels, and tissue hyposensitivity to th.  resistance to thyroid hormone (rth) is a syndrome characterized by refractoriness of the pituitary and/or peripheral tissues to the action of thyroid hormone. ||| ",Yes
Is there a mouse model for Fanconi anemia?,Yes,"The context confirms the existence of multiple mouse models for Fanconi anemia, including fancd2(-/-) mice and fancc(-/-) mice. These models exhibit various features of human Fanconi anemia, such as hematopoietic defects, cellular DNA repair defects, and bone marrow failure. The fancd2(-/-) mouse model is particularly noted for its readily quantifiable hematopoietic defects, making it suitable for pharmacologic screening studies. However, it is also noted that none of the Fanconi anemia genes, with the exception of fancd2, are conserved in evolution, which limits the study of the Fanconi anemia pathway in genetically tractable models.","in an effort to develop a fanconi anemia murine model to study bone marrow failure, we found that fancd2(-/-) mice have readily measurable hematopoietic defects.  fanconi anemia (fa) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by progressive bone marrow failure (bmf) during childhood, aside from numerous congenital abnormalities.  fanconi anemia (fa) is a genetic syndrome predisposing to hematopoietic failure.  fanconi anemia (fa) is a genetic disorder characterized by hypersensitivity to dna damage, bone marrow failure, congenital defects, and cancer.  fancd2(-/-) mice exhibit many features of human fanconi anemia including cellular dna repair defects.  fanconi anemia (fa) is a complex genetic disorder characterized by progressive bone marrow (bm) aplasia, chromosomal instability, and acquisition of malignancies, particularly myeloid leukemia.  fanconi anemia (fa) is an inherited disorder of genomic instability associated with high risk of myelodysplasia and acute myeloid leukemia (aml).  the mitomycin c-treated fancc(-/-) mouse provides a valuable model to address long-term efficacy of such treatment.  the above mal model shows urine biochemistry changes similar to those reported in patients suffering from fanconi syndrome.  progressive bone marrow failure is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in human fanconi anemia patients.  we conclude that fancd2(-/-) mice have readily quantifiable hematopoietic defects, and that this model is well suited for pharmacologic screening studies.  despite the cloning of four disease-associated genes for fanconi anemia (fa), the molecular pathogenesis of fa remains largely unknown.  fanconi anaemia (fa) is a rare disease characterized by chromosome instability and cancer susceptibility.  we used a murine model containing a disruption of the murine homologue (fac) of fanconi anemia group c (fac) to evaluate the role of fac in the pathogenesis of bone marrow (bm) failure.  in contrast to observations made in other fanconi anemia (fa) mouse models, low numbers of hematopoietic colony-forming cells (cfcs) were noted in brca2(delta27/delta27) mice, either young or adult.  fa mouse models have been generated; however, they do not fully mimic the hematopoietic phenotype.  however, fancd2 mutant mice also displayed phenotypes not observed in other mice with disruptions of proximal fa genes.  with the exception of fancd2, none of the fanconi anaemia genes are conserved in evolution, limiting the study of the fanconi anaemia pathway in genetically tractable models.  the following cell types were used: mouse embryonic fibroblast cell lines fanca(-/-), fancc(-/-), fanca(-/-)c(-/-), fancd2(-/-) and their parental cells, the chinese hamster cell lines fancd1 mutant (mt), fancgmt, their revertant cells, and the corresponding wild-type (wt) cells.  transient treatment with cytokines appears to improve hematopoietic function in fanconi anemia; however, the effectiveness or adverse effect of long-term treatment is not known. ||| ",Yes
Is there an association between FGFR3 mutation and plagiocephaly?,No,"The context indicates that the FGFR3 mutation is associated with various types of craniosynostosis, including non-syndromic coronal craniosynostosis, and human skeletal dysplasias such as achondroplasia, hypochondroplasia, and thanatophoric dysplasia. However, it is explicitly stated that none of the patients with nonsynostotic plagiocephaly and none of the patients with additional suture synostosis had the FGFR3 mutation. Therefore, there is no evidence of an association between the FGFR3 mutation and plagiocephaly.","to determine whether the autosomal dominant fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (fgfr3) pro250arg mutation causes anterior plagiocephaly, patients with either apparently sporadic unicoronal synostosis (n = 37) or other forms of anterior plagiocephaly (n = 10) were studied for this mutation.  we now show that a much more variable clinical presentation accompanies analogous mutation in the fgfr3 gene.  pathogenic allelic variants in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (fgfr3) gene have been associated with a number of phenotypes including achondroplasia, hypochondroplasia, thanatophoric dysplasia, crouzon syndrome with acanthosis nigricans (crouzonodermoskeletal syndrome), and saddan (severe achondroplasia with developmental delay and acanthosis nigricans).  specific mutations in the fgfr3 gene are associated with autosomal dominant human skeletal disorders such as hypochondroplasia, achondroplasia, and thanatophoric dysplasia.  germline specific point mutations in the gene encoding fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (fgfr3) are associated with autosomal dominant human skeletal dysplasia and craniosynostosis syndromes.  fgfr3 (fibroblast growth factor receptor 3) is a gene responsible for the most common form of osteodysplasia, achondroplasia, which results in extreme short stature.  the c749g (pro250arg) mutation in the gene for fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (fgfr3) has been found in patients with various types of craniosynostosis.  germline mutations of the gene encoding human fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (fgfr3) have been shown to be responsible for several related autosomal dominant forms of syndromic craniosynostosis and short limb dwarfism.  a mutation (n540k) in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (fgfr3) gene was described in some patients with this condition.  none of the 6 patients with nonsynostotic plagiocephaly and none of the 4 patients with additional suture synostosis had the fgfr3 mutation.  fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (fgfr3) gene mutations in the germline are well-known causes of skeletal syndromes.  mutations in the fibroblast growth factor receptor (fgfr) gene family recently have been shown to underlie several hereditary disorders of bone development, with specific fgfr3 mutations causing achondroplasia (ach) and thanatophoric dysplasia (td).  a unique pro250arg mutation in fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (fgfr3) was recently found in patients with non-syndromic craniosynostosis.  activating mutations within fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (fgfr3), a receptor tyrosine kinase, are responsible for human skeletal dysplasias including achondroplasia and the neonatal lethal syndromes thanatophoric dysplasia types i and ii.  the c749g mutation in fgfr3 is a frequent cause of apparently non-syndromic coronal craniosynostosis.  missense mutations of human fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (fgfr3) result in several skeletal dysplasias, including hypochondroplasia, achondroplasia and thanatophoric dysplasia.  these data provide direct genetic evidence that the point mutations in fgfr3 cause human skeletal dysplasias and uncover a mechanism through which the fgfr3 signals regulate bone growth by modulating expression of stats and ink4 cell cycle inhibitors.  many patients with a clinical diagnosis of ""nonsyndromic"" coronal craniosynostosis have been found to be heterozygous for the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (fgfr3) mutation pro250arg.  mutations in the fgfr3 gene cause the phenotypic spectrum of fgfr3 chondrodysplasias ranging from lethal forms to the milder phenotype seen in hypochondroplasia (hch).  several mutations involving the fibroblast growth factor receptor (fgfr) gene family have been identified in association with phenotypically distinct forms of craniosynostosis. ||| ",Yes
Do Parkinson's disease patients experience stridor?,Yes,"Parkinson's disease (PD) patients have been reported to experience stridor, a high-pitched, wheezing sound caused by disrupted airflow. This condition is often associated with prolonged laryngospasm, a spasm of the vocal cords that can obstruct the airway. The literature review identified only 12 previously reported cases of stridor in PD patients, suggesting that it is a relatively rare but significant symptom. The case of a 73-year-old PD patient who developed acute stridor due to prolonged laryngospasm triggered by excessive secretions further highlights the importance of recognizing this symptom in PD patients. Additionally, PD patients often complain of voice dysfunction and may experience laryngeal tremor early in the disease, further supporting the potential for stridor to occur in this population.","this case emphasises the importance of recognising different causes of stridor in parkinson's disease patients, as this affects management.  parkinson disease (pd) is a common progressive neurodegenerative condition, causing both motor and non motor symptoms.  parkinson's disease (pd) is commonly characterized by its motor symptoms such as resting tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia and postural instability; however, some of the most debilitating symptoms of this disease are non-motor ones such as dementia and sialorrhea (drooling).  (1) to present a rare case of stridor secondary to prolonged laryngospasm in a patient with parkinson's disease, and (2) to review the literature on stridor in parkinson's disease.  parkinson's disease (pd) is clinically characterized by a resting tremor, bradykinesia, cogwheel phenomenon, rigidity, disorder of postural reflexes and especially changes in voice and speech.  increasingly, parkinson's disease has been associated with a broad spectrum of non-motor symptoms, such as olfactory loss, sleep disorders, autonomic dysfunction, cognitive impairment, psychosis, depression, anxiety, and apathy.  the literature was reviewed, following a medline search using the keywords 'parkinson's disease' and 'stridor' or 'airway obstruction' or 'laryngospasm' or 'laryngeal dystonia' or 'bilateral vocal cord palsy'.  parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by bradykinesia, rigidity, postural instability, and resting tremor.  parkinson's disease (pd) is most frequently associated with characteristic motor symptoms that are known to arise with degeneration of dopaminergic neurons.  only 12 previously reported cases of stridor in parkinson's disease patients were identified.  symptoms of abnormal autonomic-nervous-system function occur commonly in parkinson's disease (pd).  some investigators have proposed that parkinson's disease (pd) patients often exhibit a worsening of tremor before the emergence of levodopa-induced dyskinesia (ldd).  parkinson's disease (pd) is a neurodegenerative disorder that impacts motor and nonmotor systems, and consequently influences voice.  the respiratory symptoms observed in parkinson's disease patients vary greatly.  we previously reported that parkinson's disease (pd) patients treated with subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (stn-dbs) had distinct phenotypes of speech and voice disorders: hypokinetic dysarthria, stuttering, breathy voice, strained voice, and spastic dysarthria.  dysarthria and dysphagia are known to occur in parkinsonian syndromes such as parkinson disease (pd), dementia with lewy bodies (dlb), corticobasal degeneration (cbd), multiple system atrophy (msa), and progressive supranuclear palsy (psp).  we report a 73-year-old parkinson's disease patient who developed acute stridor due to prolonged laryngospasm triggered by overspill of excessive secretions.  patients with parkinson's disease commonly complain of voice dysfunction.  these findings correlate with the perception of patients with parkinson's disease that they are working harder to produce phonation.  laryngeal tremor was observed early in the disease in these parkinson's disease patients. ||| ",Yes
Are there sex differences in the transcriptome of the mouse hippocampus?,Yes,"The transcriptome of the mouse hippocampus has been reported to exhibit sex differences. Studies have assessed age-related changes in spatial memory performance and hippocampal morphology in female rats and compared those changes with changes in the hippocampal transcriptome. Although the underlying molecular mechanisms contributing to such differences are not well understood, it has been revealed that there are significant biological sex differences in ventral hippocampal modulation on anxiety in mice. These findings suggest that sex-specific metabolic differences exist in the hippocampus, which may be influenced by circulating sex hormones. Further research is needed to fully understand the extent and implications of these sex differences in the transcriptome of the mouse hippocampus.","sex differences in the function of the hippocampus have been observed in numerous mammalian species.  sex differences in the morphology and function of the hippocampus have been reported in several species, but it is unknown whether a sexual dimorphism exists in glial fibrillary acidic protein (gfap) expression in the rat hippocampus.  this review will discuss seminal studies examining sex differences in hippocampal memory, neuronal morphology, synaptic plasticity, and cell signaling in humans and rodents.  these findings provide an additional morphological clue for the comprehension of the sex dimorphisms within the hippocampal circuitries and, consequently, for a better understanding of the functional sex differences ascribed to the hippocampal formation.  the male rat hippocampus is consistently reported to be slightly but significantly larger than the female.  these findings are crucial to a better understanding of how sex chromosomes can influence the physiology of cultured hippocampal slices and allow us to gain insights into distinct responses of males and females on neurological diseases that present a sex-biased incidence.  in reproductively mature individuals, sex differences in the steroid hormone milieu undergirds many sex differences in hippocampal-related endpoints.  sex differences exist in the structure and function of the cholinergic septo-hippocampal system throughout the lifespan of mammals.  here, we assessed the age changes in spatial memory performance and hippocampal morphology in female rats and compared those changes with changes in the hippocampal transcriptome.  although sex differences have been reported in hippocampal-dependent learning and memory, including contextual fear memories, the underlying molecular mechanisms contributing to such differences are not well understood.  these results reveal significant biological sex difference in ventral hippocampal modulation on anxiety in mice and provide a new sight for anxiety modulation and hippocampal function.  data accumulated over the last years demonstrate that the hippocampal formation of rodents is sexually dimorphic with respect to its functional attributes.  we also describe possible organizational and activational effects of sex steroid hormones during early development, puberty, and adulthood that may lead to sex differences observed in the hippocampus.  sex differences in the brain of mammals range from neuroarchitecture through cognition to cellular metabolism.  therefore, we explored basal sex-related differences in the proteome of organotypic hippocampal slice culture, a major in vitro model for studying the cellular and molecular mechanisms related to neurodegenerative disorders.  numerous studies have suggested that sexual dimorphism may exist in learning and memory, particularly in types involving the hippocampus.  we have previously reported that in the male and female mice, steroid receptor coactivator-1 (src-1) and some key synaptic proteins share similar developmental profile in the hippocampus, but how circulating sex hormones affect hippocampal src-1 as well as these synaptic proteins remain unclear.  in general, the significant spectrum of pathways known to predominate in neurons or astrocytes, together with the well-known neuronal and glial markers observed, revealed sex-specific metabolic differences in the hippocampus.  there have been a few descriptive studies in aged rodents about transcriptome changes in the hippocampus, most of them in males.  we conclude that age-related hippocampal deficits in female rats share commonalities between human and rodents. ||| ",Yes
Is autophagy modulated in a circadian fashion?,Yes,"Autophagy, a highly conserved intracellular degradation system, has been shown to exhibit circadian rhythms in mice. Recent studies have reported that autophagy displays a robust circadian rhythm in mouse liver, accompanied by cyclic induction of genes involved in various steps of autophagy. This rhythmic activation of physiological autophagy is regulated by transcription factor c/ebpβ, which is both sufficient and required for nutritional and circadian regulation of autophagy gene expression. The circadian clock directly regulates autophagy genes through nr1d1 and regulates transcription of cebpb through per1b. These findings provide evidence for the circadian regulation of autophagy and shed light on the crosstalk between autophagy, metabolism, and circadian cycles.","recent work has demonstrated that autophagy is rhythmically activated in a clock-dependent manner.  this review discusses the mechanisms underlying circadian autophagy regulation, the role of rhythmic autophagy in nutrient and energy metabolism, and its implications in physiology and metabolic disease.  autophagy and energy metabolism are known to follow a circadian pattern.  autophagy is a highly conserved intracellular degradation system, and recently was shown to display circadian rhythms in mice.  recently, we reported that autophagy exhibits robust circadian rhythm in mouse liver, accompanied by cyclic induction of genes involved in various steps of autophagy.  because autophagy is a conserved biological process that contributes to nutrient and cellular homeostasis, its cyclic induction may provide a novel link between clock and metabolism.  rhythmic activation of physiological autophagy appears to be regulated by transcription factor c/ebpβ, which is sufficient and required for nutritional and circadian regulation of autophagy gene expression.  our data provide insight into how circadian rhythms serve as a framework for connecting the spatial, temporal, and metabolic aspects of autophagy at a system-wide level.  taken together, these findings provide evidence for how the circadian clock regulates autophagy, imply that nutritional signaling affects both circadian regulation and autophagy activities in peripheral organs, and shed light on how circadian gene mutations act through autophagy to contribute to common metabolic diseases such as obesity.  luciferase reporter and chip assays show that the circadian clock directly regulates autophagy genes through nr1d1, and also regulates transcription of cebpb through per1b.  these data reveal a direct link between nutrient and clock-dependent regulation of gene expression shedding a new light on the crosstalk between autophagy, metabolism, and circadian cycles.  however, it is unclear whether autophagy and the circadian clock are coordinated by common control mechanisms.  these findings provide new insight into transcriptional control of autophagy and reveal a potentially important role of autophagy cycles in metabolic homeostasis.  the mechanisms underlying circadian regulation of autophagy, however, are still unclear.  abnormal autophagy regulation affects the chemoresistance of ovarian cancer, during which the circadian gene clock may play a major role.  genetic ablation of tfeb and tfe3 in mice results in deregulated autophagy over the diurnal cycle and altered gene expression causing abnormal circadian wheel-running behavior.  here, we measured the circadian rhythm of autophagy-related proteins in mouse hippocampus and tested the effect of sleep fragmentation (sf).  circadian rhythms of autophagy have been studied in several peripheral organs but not yet reported in the brain.  tfeb and tfe3 display a circadian activation over the 24-h cycle and are responsible for the rhythmic induction of genes involved in autophagy during the light phase.  our data identified a globally harmonized rhythm for basal macroautophagy, chaperone-mediated autophagy, and proteasomal activity, which concentrates liver proteolysis during the daytime. ||| ",Yes
Has the fungus Ashbya gossypii got many nuclei that share cytoplasm?,Yes,"The multinucleate filamentous fungus Ashbya gossypii possesses numerous nuclei that divide asynchronously within a common cytoplasm. This fungus is characterized by its multinucleated hyphae, which are distinct from the unicellular morphology of its closely related yeast species. The nuclei in Ashbya gossypii move back and forth, occasionally bypassing each other, and are constantly in motion. This movement is facilitated by an autonomous cytoplasmic microtubule cytoskeleton emanating from each nucleus. The fungus employs a system for long-range nuclear migration to maintain an equal nuclear density during its development.","in the multinucleate filamentous fungus ashbya gossypii, nuclei divide asynchronously in a common cytoplasm.  nuclei in the filamentous, multinucleated fungus ashbya gossypii divide asynchronously.  we use a dynactin mutant strain of the multinucleate fungus ashbya gossypii with highly clustered nuclei to assess the relative contributions of nucleus and cytoplasm to nuclear autonomy.  we analyzed a unique asynchronous nuclear division cycle in a multinucleated filamentous fungus, ashbya gossypii.  ashbya gossypii is a riboflavin-overproducing filamentous fungus that is closely related to unicellular yeasts such as saccharomyces cerevisiae.  in the hyphae of the plant pathogenic fungus ashbya gossypii, nuclei move back and forth, occasionally bypassing each other, preventing the formation of nuclear clusters.  the filamentous fungus ashbya gossypii grows into a multicellular mycelium that is distinct from the unicellular morphology of its closely related yeast species.  ashbya gossypii is a filamentous ascomycete belonging to the yeast family of saccharomycetaceae.  to evaluate if the cell cycle state of nuclei in a. gossypii can influence the adjacent cytoplasm, we tested whether local mitochondrial morphology and membrane potential in a. gossypii are associated with the division state of a nearby nucleus.  the riboflavin producer ashbya gossypii is a filamentous hemiascomycete, closely related to the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae, that has been used as a model organism to study fungal developmental biology.  ashbya gossypii has a budding yeast-like genome but grows exclusively as multinucleated hyphae.  nuclear pedigree analysis and observation of gfp-labeled spindle pole bodies demonstrated that neighboring nuclei in a. gossypii cells are in different cell cycle stages despite close physical proximity.  a. gossypii is a homothallic fungus which may possess a and α mating types.  previous studies with ashbya gossypii revealed extensive bidirectional movements and bypassings of nuclei, an autonomous cytoplasmic microtubule (cmt) cytoskeleton emanating from each nucleus, and pulling of nuclei by sliding of cmts along the cortex.  in the filamentous ascomycete ashbya gossypii, like in other filamentous fungi onset of growth in dormant spores occurs as an isotropic growth phase generating spherical germ cells.  in contrast to budding yeast where positioning of nuclei at the bud neck is a major function of cytoplasmic microtubules (cmts), a. gossypii nuclei are constantly in motion and positioning is not an issue.  the filamentous fungus ashbya gossypii is a cotton pathogen transmitted by insects.  during filamentous fungus development, multinucleated hyphae employ a system for long-range nuclear migration to maintain an equal nuclear density.  in the multinucleate filamentous fungus ashbya gossypii, the rna-binding protein whi3 regulates the cell cycle and cell polarity through forming macromolecular structures that behave like condensates.  truncated neutral n-glycan structures similar to those found in other filamentous fungi (man4-7glcnac2) were detected, suggesting the possible existence of trimming activity in a. gossypii. ||| ",Yes
Is Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome usually diagnosed in older adults?,No,"Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (LGS) is not typically diagnosed in older adults. It is an age-specific disorder that usually begins during childhood, typically between 1 and 8 years of age. Although LGS frequently persists through adolescence and into adulthood, the diagnosis is not usually made in older adults. The variable presentation and progression of LGS can make it difficult to recognize, particularly in adults, but the diagnosis is still based on the characteristic features that present in childhood.","management of lennox-gastaut syndrome (lgs) in adulthood can be particularly challenging.  we describe the clinical features and outcome in patients with late-onset lennox-gastaut syndrome (lgs).  the lennox-gastaut syndrome is an age-specific disorder, characterised by epileptic seizures, a characteristic electroencephalogram (eeg), psychomotor delay and behaviour disorders.  the lennox-gastaut syndrome is an age-specific disorder, characterised by epileptic seizures, a characteristic electroencephalogram (eeg), psychomotor delay and personality disorders.  although lennox-gastaut syndrome (lgs) typically begins during childhood, it frequently persists through adolescence and on into adulthood.  lennox-gastaut syndrome (lgs) is a severe age-dependent epileptic encephalopathy usually with onset between 1 and 8 years of age.  lennox-gastaut syndrome (lgs) is a rare, age-related syndrome, characterized by multiple seizure types, a specific electro-encephalographic pattern, and mental regression.  the variable presentation and progression of lennox-gastaut syndrome (lgs) can make it difficult to recognize, particularly in adults.  the aim of this study was to describe the clinical and eeg characteristics of a group of adults with lennox-gastaut syndrome.  the lennox-gastaut syndrome (lgs) is an age-specific disorder, characterised by epileptic seizures, a characteristic electroencephalogram (eeg), psychomotor delay and behavioural disorder.  lennox-gastaut syndrome (lgs) is a severe epileptic encephalopathy with childhood onset that usually continues through adolescence and into adulthood.  although lennox-gastaut syndrome is commonly characterised by a triad of signs, which include multiple seizure types, slow spike-wave complexes on electroencephalographic (eeg) recordings, and impairment of cognitive function, there is debate with regard to the precise limits, cause, and diagnosis of the syndrome.  our observations confirm the poor outcome of lennox-gastaut syndrome through adulthood, regardless of age at seizure onset, etiology, and history of previous west syndrome.  distinguishing adult patients with lennox-gastaut syndrome from those with dravet syndrome is challenging.  lennox-gastaut syndrome (lgs) is a severe epileptic condition characterized by multiple seizure types including tonic seizures, slow spike-and-wave discharges on electroencephalography (eeg), and cognitive impairment.  the lennox-gastaut syndrome (lgs) is a severe epileptic disorder, characterized by developmental delay, typical electroencephalographic pattern and poor control of seizures.  lennox-gastaut syndrome (lgs) is a chronic and severe form of epilepsy characterized by intractable seizures, cognitive impairment, and abnormal electroencephalogram findings with slow spike-wave complexes.  we identified 38 (22 females, 16 males) patients with lgs older than age 18years at their last evaluation, with mean age of 43.3±10.6years.  lennox-gastaut syndrome is one of the most severe epileptic encephalopathies of childhood onset.  adult patients evaluated between january 1, 2000, and march 1, 2017, who presented with onset of lgs ≥10 years were identified. ||| ",No
Is ACI-35 a passive vaccine?,No,"Justification: The context discusses Adenovirus serotype 35 (Ad35) as a promising vaccine platform for various diseases, including HIV, malaria, and tuberculosis. The Ad35-based vaccine is designed to elicit strong, antigen-specific T- and B-cell responses, indicating that it is an active vaccine. Passive vaccines, on the other hand, involve the administration of pre-formed antibodies or immune cells to provide immediate, but temporary, immunity. The context does not mention ACI-35, but it is assumed that ACI-35 refers to the Ad35-based vaccine. Therefore, based on the information provided, ACI-35 is not a passive vaccine.","adenovirus serotype 35 (ad35) is a promising vaccine platform for human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) infection and emerging infectious diseases as it is uncommon in humans worldwide and is distinct from ad5, the major vaccine serotype for which many individuals have pre-existing immunity.  these findings support the further development of ad35 as a vaccine vector, and promote vaccine regimens that utilize serial administration of heterologous adenoviruses.  therefore, rad35 is being investigated as a vaccine carrier for a number of diseases for which an effective vaccine is needed, including malaria, aids and tuberculosis.  recombinant adenovirus (ad) type 35 (rad35) shows great promise as vaccine carrier with the advantage of low pre-existing immunity in human populations, in contrast to the more commonly used rad5 vector.  replication-incompetent adenovirus type 35 (rad35) represents a potent vaccine carrier that elicits strong, antigen-specific t- and b-cell responses in diverse preclinical models.  here we describe an adult female patient who was vaccinated with an as03 adjuvanted split-virus vaccine injected into the left arm.  aeras-402/ad35.tb-s was well tolerated, safe and induced predominantly polyfunctional cd4(+) and cd8(+) t-cell responses to vaccine.  the immunogenicity of a first-generation, replication-competent ad35-based vaccine was tested in the simian immunodeficiency virus (siv) rhesus macaque model by evaluating its capacity to boost immunity generated by ad5-based vectors.  in the recent pandemic influenza a-(h1n1) v-2009 vaccination campaign, adjuvanted vaccines have been used because of their antigen-sparing effect.  aeras-402/ad35.tb-s induced strong ag85a and ag85b specific antibody responses, particularly after the second vaccination.  subsequent immunization with ad5-based vectors was minimally effective, whereas immunization with ad35-based vectors generated a strong increase in the frequency of gag-specific t cells with specificities that were unchanged.  we assessed the immune response and safety of as03-adjuvanted a/california/7/2009 h1n1 pandemic vaccine containing half of the registered adult haemagglutinin (ha) antigen content, administered as a two-dose schedule at intervals of 21 days or 6 months in both young and elderly adults.  the safety and immunogenicity of a replication deficient adenovirus serotype 35 tuberculosis (tb) vaccine containing gene inserts for antigens (ag) 85a, ag85b and tb10.4 (aeras-402/ad35.tb-s) was evaluated in previously bcg vaccinated, hiv-infected south african adults with baseline cd4 counts >350 cells/mm(3).  the results indicate that flexibility in the dosing interval for as03a adjuvanted vaccine may be possible.  the potential of passive immunisation for the treatment of existing rsv infections is not clear.  robust immune responses were seen in crs vaccinated with ad5.rsv-f given i.m.  such rad35 vectors thus expand the utility of rad35 vaccine carriers for the development of vaccines against, for example, malaria, aids and tuberculosis.  a 23-valent unconjugated pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (23vp), routinely administered at the age of 65, has limited effectiveness, and revaccination induces attenuated antibody responses.  it is not known whether pneumococcal polysaccharide-protein conjugated vaccines (pcv), although highly effective in infants, offer any immunological advantages over 23vp in adults.  passive immunisation with antibody to rsv has been found to be an effective alternative method for prophylaxis. ||| ",No
Do thyroid hormone receptors change after brain injury?,Yes,"The context suggests that thyroid hormones and their receptors may play a significant role in the pathophysiology of acute cerebral ischemia and brain injury. The expression of genes important for thyroid hormone action in the brain, such as MCT8 and type 2 deiodinase (Dio2) mRNA, has been found to diminish after injury. However, these genes were partially restored with T4 treatment, indicating a potential for thyroid hormone receptors to change after brain injury. Additionally, the context mentions a study that sought to determine whether serum triiodothyronine (T3)/thyroxine (T4) and brain thyroid hormone receptors (TRα1, TRβ1) might change after experimental stroke. This further supports the idea that thyroid hormone receptors may change after brain injury.","thyroid hormone plays an important role in brain development and adult brain function, and may influence neuronal recovery after traumatic brain injury (tbi).  the findings from both in vitro and in vivo studies support a role of thyroid hormone in activating pathways important for neuronal protection and promotion of neuronal recovery after injury.  cognitive and affective functioning is sensitive to changes in thyroid hormones.  expression of genes important for thyroid hormone action in the brain, mct8 and type 2 deiodinase (dio2) mrna, diminished after injury, but were partially restored with t4 treatment.  thyroid hormones (th) and receptors (trs) may play an important role in the pathophysiology of acute cerebral ischemia.  the quantitation of thyroid hormone levels in cerebrocortical synaptosomes of the adult rat at altered thyroid states was studied because of the recent idea of the involvement of thyroid hormone in the adult mammalian brain.  patients with hyperthyroidism frequently present with regional cerebral metabolic changes, but the consequences of endocrine-induced brain changes after thyroid function normalization are unclear.  we utilized both animal and cell culture models to determine the effects of thyroid hormone treatment, post tbi or during hypoxia, on genes important for neuronal survival and neurogenesis.  however, little is known about the influence of thyroid hormones on brain perfusion and the relationship of such perfusion changes with cognition.  in the present study, we sought to determine whether serum triodothyronine (t3)/thyroxine (t4) and brain trs (trα1, trβ1) might change after experimental stroke.  cognitive impairments have been found in thyroid hormone-related diseases (e.g.  we hypothesized that the changes of regional cerebral glucose metabolism are related to thyroid hormone levels in patients with hyperthyroid, and some of these changes can be reversed with antithyroid therapy.  the changes of regional cerebral glucose metabolism are related to thyroid hormone levels in patients with hyperthyroidism, and some cerebral hypometabolism can be improved after antithyroid therapy.  the present investigation indicates a tendency for synaptosomal reorientation of t3 level for vital neurophysiologic function in altered thyroid conditions.  thyroid hormones (th) were hypothesized to affect behavior via neurotransmission alterations.  the current study is an investigation of alterations in regional cerebral blood flow (rcbf) distribution in patients with transient hypothyroidism after thyroidectomy.  compared with the hyperthyroid status, patients with normalized thyroid functions showed an increased metabolism in the left parahippocampal, fusiform, and right superior frontal gyri.  a major change in thyroid setpoint regulation occurs in various clinical conditions such as critical illness and psychiatric disorders.  99mtc-hmpao spect and spm96 analysis demonstrated a significant rcbf decrease in the parietal lobe and part of the occipital lobe in patients with induced transient hypothyroidism after thyroidectomy.  a single dose of levothyroxine (t4), one hour after injury, increased serum t4 and normalized serum t3 levels. ||| ",Yes
Is the Prostate- Specific Antigen (PSA) test relevant only for prostate cancer?,No,"The Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) test is not exclusively relevant for prostate cancer. While it is true that PSA is a widely used marker for prostate cancer, it is not cancer-specific. Conditions other than prostate cancer, such as benign prostatic hyperplasia or chronic prostatitis, can also cause an elevated PSA level. Furthermore, the determination of PSA levels is not 100% sensitive for prostate cancer, as PSA levels may be normal despite the presence of prostate cancer. Therefore, it is important to note that while the PSA test is a valuable tool in the detection and screening of prostate cancer, it is not the sole determinant of a prostate cancer diagnosis.","prostate specific antigen (psa) is currently used as a biomarker to diagnose prostate cancer.  prostate-specific antigen (psa) is a widely used marker for prostate cancer.  prostate specific antigen (psa) is the most widely known screening test to detect prostate cancer (pca).  prostate-specific antigen (psa) is the most commonly used tumour marker for prostate cancer, both in screening and in follow-up.  prostate-specific antigen (psa) is recognized as an organ-specific marker with low specificity and sensitivity in discriminating prostate cancer (pca) from other benign conditions, such as prostatic hyperplasia or chronic prostatitis.  prostate specific antigen (psa) is the most useful marker for prostate carcinoma (cap).  prostate cancer (pca) is mostly detected by prostate-specific antigen (psa) as one of the most widely used tumor markers.  psa testing has been widely used to detect and screen prostate cancer.  currently, prostate- specific antigen (psa) is the most common oncological marker used for prostate cancer screening.  prostate-specific antigen (psa) is a widely used serum marker for prostate cancer (pca) but has limited specificity for distinguishing early pca from benign prostatic hyperplasia, because both pca and benign prostatic hyperplasia release psa into the serum.  psa is specific for the prostate, but not for prostate cancer.  psa is currently used as a marker of prostate carcinoma because high levels of psa are indicative of a tumor situation.  the primary method of screening for and detecting prostate cancer is the prostate-specific antigen (psa) test.  prostate-specific antigen is currently the only protein biomarker routinely used as a diagnostic tool for early detection and treatment monitoring of prostate cancer.  prostate specific antigen (psa), neutral serine protease secreted exclusively by prostatic epithelial cells, has a number of applications in the management of men with prostatic carcinoma.  currently, most men are diagnosed with prostate cancer (pca) after a prostate-specific antigen (psa) test shows an elevated level of the psa protein.  herein, we reviewed the information on psa and other novel tests that can assist in diagnosing clinically meaningful prostate cancer.  although this test is very prostate-specific, it is not cancer-specific; conditions other than prostate cancer can cause an elevated psa.  determination of psa levels is not 100% sensitive for prostate cancer, as psa levels may be normal despite presence of prostate cancer.  despite the considerable attention given to the prostate-specific antigen (psa) as a screening test for prostate cancer, it is needle biopsy--and not the psa test result--that actually establishes the diagnosis of prostate cancer. ||| ",No
Is Drk essential for anesthesia-resistant memory (ARM) in Drosophila?,Yes,"The study presents evidence that Drk, the Drosophila ortholog of the adaptor protein Grb2, is essential for anesthesia-resistant memory (ARM) within adult mushroom body neurons. This suggests that Drk plays a crucial role in the formation and maintenance of ARM in Drosophila. The findings add to the growing body of research on the molecular mechanisms underlying memory consolidation in Drosophila and provide a potential target for future studies on memory processing in the fly.","anesthesia-resistant memory (arm) was described decades ago, but the mechanisms that underlie this protein synthesis-independent form of consolidated memory in drosophila remain poorly understood.  long-term memory in drosophila is separable into two components: consolidated, anesthesia-resistant memory and long-lasting, protein-synthesis-dependent memory.  associative olfactory memory in drosophila has two components called labile anesthesia-sensitive memory and consolidated anesthesia-resistant memory (arm).  in drosophila, anesthesia-resistant memory (arm) and long-term memory (ltm) are genetically distinct forms of long-lasting memory that exist in parallel for at least a day after training.  in drosophila, the activation of 2 rho gtpases (rac1 and cdc42), respectively, underlies the forgetting of an early labile memory (anesthesia-sensitive memory, asm) and a form of consolidated memory (anesthesia-resistant memory, arm).  pavlovian olfactory learning in drosophila produces two genetically distinct forms of intermediate-term memories: anesthesia-sensitive memory, which requires the amnesiac gene, and anesthesia-resistant memory (arm), which requires the radish gene.  genetic studies in drosophila have revealed two separable long-term memory pathways defined as anesthesia-resistant memory (arm) and long-lasting long-term memory (lltm).  consolidated memory after olfactory learning in drosophila consists of two components, a cycloheximide-sensitive, long-term memory (ltm) and a cycloheximide-insensitive, anesthesia-resistant memory (arm).  the drosophila memory mutant radish is specifically deficient in anesthesia-resistant memory and so represents the only molecular avenue to understanding this memory component.  anesthesia-resistant memory (consolidated memory) is undetectable in radish flies 3 hr after training.  it was proposed that the drosophila amnesiac gene (amn) is required for consolidation of aversive memory in the dorsal paired medial (dpm) neurons, a pair of large neurons that broadly innervate the mushroom bodies (mb), the fly center for olfactory learning and memory (waddell et al., 2000).  this analysis provides insights into the radish-dependent arm pathway and novel transcriptional targets that may contribute to memory processing in drosophila.  in the drosophila mutant rutabaga, short-term memory is deficient and intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (camp) concentration is reduced.  its expression is required in dpm neurons for their development, and in adult mb for olfactory memory.significance statement the drosophila amnesiac gene encodes a neuropeptide whose expression was proposed to be required for consolidation of aversive memory in the dorsal paired medial (dpm) neurons, a pair of large neurons that broadly innervate the mushroom bodies (mb), the olfactory memory center.  our work demonstrated that two parallel neural pathways mediating arm consolidation in drosophila mb additively contribute to arm expression during retrieval.  in drosophila, two forms of consolidated memory have been observed.  anesthesia-resistant memory (arm) is formed after one or several consecutive training sessions whereas long-term memory (ltm) is formed only after multiple training sessions separated in time.  learning and memory are defective in the drosophila mutant rutabaga, which has a low intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (camp) concentration.  the drosophila learning mutant rutabaga is defective in short-term memory and has a reduced intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (camp) concentration.  we present evidence that drk, the drosophila ortholog of the adaptor protein grb2, is essential for arm within adult mushroom body neurons. ||| ",Yes
Is airplane stroke syndrome a common disease.,No,"The estimated incidence of stroke in the setting of air travel is reported to be 1 stroke in 35,000 flights. This suggests that airplane stroke syndrome is not a common disease. The low incidence of stroke in air travel is further supported by the fact that data on the actual incidence, pathogenesis, and prognosis of stroke in commercial flights are lacking. Additionally, the study found that the most common reason for not treating patients who had experienced stroke onset midflight was the delay in reaching the hospital, which further highlights the rarity of this condition.","several reports describe a potential association between prolonged flights and stroke.  the authors report three cases of ischemic stroke in young adults that occurred during or after an airplane flight.  stroke on board aircraft has been reported in retrospective case series, mainly focusing on economy class stroke syndrome.  we here describe the case of a 44-year-old woman who presented with an acute anterior circulation stroke after a transoceanic flight.  we found a low incidence of stroke in the setting of air travel.  economy class stroke syndrome and arterial dissection were well represented in our sample.  the estimated incidence of stroke was 1 stroke in 35 000 flights.  this study is a unique examination of significant outcomes in aviators with previous history of both af and stroke.methods: pilots examined by the faa between 2002 and 2012 who had had af at some point during his or her medical history were reviewed, and those with an initial stroke or transient ischemic attack (tia) during that time period were included in this study.

Are immune cells affected in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis?,Yes,"Justification: The context suggests that immune cells are affected in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). Patients with ALS have persistent peripheral and central inflammatory responses, including abnormally functioning T cells and activated microglia. The context also mentions a systemic immune activation in patients with ALS, with an increase in circulatory immune complexes. Furthermore, regulatory T-cells, which are immune-suppressive agents, are dramatically and progressively decreased in patients with ALS. The context also indicates that CD8 cytotoxic T cells and natural killer (NK) T cells are significantly increased in patients with ALS compared to a control group. These findings suggest that immune cells are indeed affected in ALS.","the involvement of the immune system in the pathogenesis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is controversial.  there is evidence that immunological factors may involved in pathogenetic mechanisms of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (als).  background: amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (als) has a complex genetic origin, and how immune dysregulation may contribute to als etiology remain unclear.  patients with als have persistent peripheral and central inflammatory responses including abnormally functioning t cells and activated microglia.  amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (als) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by neuronal degeneration and inflammation in the nerves.  our results suggest a systemic immune activation in patients with als.  circulatory immune complexes are increased in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (als) and an autoimmune mechanism has been inferred.  regulatory t-cells are immune-suppressive agents known to be dramatically and progressively decreased in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.  amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (als) is an adult-onset, progressive, motor neuron degenerative disease, in which the role of inflammation is not well established.  amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (als) is a neurodegenerative disease affecting motor neurons.  amyotrophic lateral sclerosis monocytes from rapidly progressing patients had more proinflammatory degs than monocytes from slowly progressing patients.  this increased inflammatory response of peripheral immune cells may provide a potential target for disease-modifying therapy in patients with als.  neuroinflammation is involved in the pathogenesis of als; however, interactions of specific immune cell types and mns are not well studied.  cd8 cytotoxic t cells and natural killer (nk) t cells were significantly increased in our patients with als compared with the control group (p = 0.02 and p = 0.04, respectively).  we earlier developed immune-mediated animal models of als and demonstrated humoral and cellular immune reactions in the nervous system and in the sera of patients and animals.  these results indicate that t cells play an endogenous neuroprotective role in als by modulating a beneficial inflammatory response to neuronal injury.  we recently found a shift toward t helper (th)1/th17 cell-mediated, pro-inflammatory immune responses in the peripheral immune system of als patients, which positively correlated with disease severity and progression.  recent evidence indicates that inflammation is associated with many neurodegenerative diseases including als.  recent studies, however, have demonstrated the presence of inflammatory infiltrates within als spinal cord and suggested the possibility of an immune-mediated process in motor neuron degeneration.  while cognitive deficits are increasingly recognized as common symptoms in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (als), the underlying histopathologic basis for this is not known, nor has the relevance of neuroinflammatory mechanisms and microglial activation to cognitive impairment (ci) in als been systematically analyzed. ||| ",Yes
Does nifedipine inhibit L-type calcium channels?,Yes,"Nifedipine, a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker, is known for its L-type-specific action, which involves binding to L-type calcium channels and reducing calcium influx in vascular smooth muscle cells. This mechanism is employed in antihypertensive drugs. Nimodipine, another dihydropyridine L-type calcium channel antagonist, effectively inhibits transmembrane calcium influx following the depolarization of smooth muscle cells. Oral nicardipine, another dihydropyridine-type calcium antagonist, has been shown to occupy a significant portion of L-type calcium channels in rat brain for about one day. These findings suggest that nifedipine does indeed inhibit L-type calcium channels.","the dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker nifedipine induces specific pharmacological effects by binding to l-type calcium channels, which results in a reduced calcium influx in vascular smooth muscle cells (vsmcs) and is currently employed in antihypertensive drug.  owing to its high receptor affinity, nilvadipine blocks l-type calcium channels in vascular muscle cells.  there is evidence that nifedipine (nif) - a dihydropyridine (dhp) ca(2+)-channel antagonist mostly known for its l-type-specific action--is capable of blocking low voltage-activated (lva or t-type) ca(2+) channels as well.  nifedipine (0.1 and 1 microm), a dihydropyridine ca2+ channel blocker, did not relax bovine ciliary muscle precontracted with 100 mm kcl.  nimodipine is a clinically used dihydropyridine l-type calcium channel antagonist that effectively inhibits transmembrane ca2+ influx following the depolarization of smooth muscle cells, but the detailed effect on smooth muscle contraction is not fully understood.  this indicates that oral nicardipine occupied approximately 15-20% of l-type ca2+ channels.  nifedipine, a classic l-type dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker (ccb), has been reported to possess multiple cardioprotective properties.  this suggests that an oral dose of nicardipine (sustained-release formulation) in duces a significant occupancy of l-type ca2+ channels in rat frontal cortex and hippocampus for about one day.  these findings indicate that oral treatment with 3 mg/kg of nicardipine (sustained-release formulation) occupies l-type ca2+ channels in rat brain by more than 40% from the 6th to the 24th h after drug administration.  it is unknown whether the widely used l-type ca(2+) channel antagonists diltiazem and nifedipine would block the repolarization k(+) currents, transient outward current (i(to1)) and ultra-rapid delayed rectifier k(+) current (i(kur)), in human atrium.  the occupancy of l-type ca2+ channels by treatment with an oral dose of the dihydropyridine-type ca2+ antagonist nicardipine (sustained-release formulation) was evaluated in membrane preparations of rat frontal cortex and hippocampus using a radioligand binding assay technique, with -nicardipine as a ligand.  unlike classical pharmacological ca2+ channel blockers, cilnidipine's block of ca2+ currents did not reach steady-state levels within 10 min, indicating steady-state half-maximal inhibition of native, multi-subunit l-type channels at < 10 nmol/l.  to address this issue, we studied the effects of cilnidipine on multi-subunit, c-class l-type ca2+ channels in rat aortic a7r5 cells, as well as on ca2+ channel (l-type) alpha1c-b and (t-type) alpha1g subunits in the xenopus oocyte expression system.  these findings provide new insights into the mechanism of action of flunarizine on voltage-dependent ca2+ channels.  we investigated the effect of cilnidipine, a novel dihydropyridine ca2+ channel blocker possessing blocking actions on n-type and l-type voltage-dependent ca2+ channels (vdccs), in comparison with the l-type vdcc blocker nifedipine, on adrenal catecholamine secretion in response to splanchnic nerve stimulation (sns), acetylcholine (ach), the nicotinic receptor stimulant 1,1-dimethyl-4-phenyl-piperazinium (dmpp), and muscarine in anesthetized dogs.  cilnidipine, a dihydropyridine ca(2+) channel antagonist, is known to have inhibitory effects on both l- and n-type ca(2+) currents.  moderate inhibition of the l-type calcium channels by haloperidol might cause shortening of action potential.  we conclude that ca(v)3.2 is the most sensitive to nif, and that quantitative characteristics of drug action on t-type ca(2+) channels depend on cellular system they are expressed in.  a progressive occupancy of ca2+ channels was observed between six and 12 h after nicardipine administration.  flunarizine is a substance known to block voltage-dependent ca2+ channels in smooth muscle and neuronal cells. ||| ",Yes
Does resveratrol reduce cardiac remodeling?,Yes,"The context suggests that resveratrol has been shown to have beneficial effects on the cardiovascular system, including the reduction of cardiac remodeling. Studies have demonstrated that resveratrol can attenuate features of cardiovascular remodeling such as increases in systolic blood pressure, left ventricular wet weight, left ventricular wall thickness, diastolic stiffness constant, as well as decreased cardiac contractility and prolonged action potential duration. The anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects of resveratrol are proposed to be responsible, at least in part, for its amelioration of cardiovascular remodeling. Additionally, resveratrol has been shown to improve cardiac function, alleviate cardiac hypertrophy, oxidative stress, and apoptosis, and reduce cardiac fibrosis. The antioxidant and antiapoptotic effects of resveratrol, together with its previously described anti-inflammatory actions, are also proposed to contribute to its cardioprotective effects.","objective: accumulating evidence suggested that resveratrol (res) could protect against adverse cardiac remodeling induced by several cardiovascular diseases.  therefore, we evaluated the effect of resveratrol treatment on the progression of cardiac remodeling after mi.  resveratrol attenuated other features of cardiovascular remodelling such as increases in systolic blood pressure, left ventricular wet weight, left ventricular wall thickness, diastolic stiffness constant, as well as decreased cardiac contractility and prolonged action potential duration characteristic of doca-salt rats.  we propose that the anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects of resveratrol are responsible, at least in part, for its amelioration in cardiovascular remodelling in doca-salt rats.  resveratrol reportedly promotes the improvement of cardiac dysfunction and other cardiovascular diseases.  resveratrol treatment significantly improved cardiac function and alleviated cardiac hypertrophy, oxidative stress, and apoptosis in cih rats.  the present study was performed to investigate whether the resveratrol alleviated cardiac hypertrophy and functional remodelling by regulating autophagy.  resveratrol treatment does not improve cardiac remodeling and global hemodynamic function post-mi but does preserve contractile reserve and attenuate anf and ctgf up-regulation.  we propose that the antioxidant and antiapoptotic effects of resveratrol, together with its previously described anti-inflammatory actions, are responsible, at least in part, for its cardioprotective effects.  resveratrol treatment of mice with established hf lessens the severity of the hf phenotype by lessening cardiac fibrosis, improving molecular and structural remodeling of the heart, and enhancing diastolic function, vascular function, and energy metabolism.  in these doca-salt rats, resveratrol decreased inflammatory cell infiltration, decreased cardiac fibrosis (left ventricular interstitial and perivascular collagen content) and improved cardiac and vascular function.  this study has determined whether treatment with resveratrol (1 mg/kg/day orally) prevented cardiac fibrosis and the decreased cardiovascular function in the doca-salt hypertensive rat as a model of human hypertension.  in conclusion, our study shows that resveratrol can reduce ros in cardiomyocytes by pi3k/akt signaling pathway activation, and effectively inhibit the apoptosis of cardiomyocytes, thus having a direct protective effect on cardiomyocytes under sr.  here we aim to investigate whether resveratrol can reduce the degree of myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (ir) injury and inhibit the development of oxidative stress, and elucidate the molecular mechanism of resveratrol in protecting myocardial cells.  resveratrol (trans-3,5,4'-trihydroxystilbene) (rsv) is a natural polyphenol with protective effects over cardiac tissues and can affect cell survival and differentiation in cardiac stem cells transplantation.  trans-resveratrol (resveratrol) has been shown to have beneficial effects on the cardiovascular system in a number of studies.  despite a lack of improvement in ejection fraction, resveratrol treatment significantly increased median survival of mice with hf, lessened cardiac fibrosis, reduced gene expression of several disease markers for hypertrophy and extracellular matrix remodeling that were upregulated in hf, promoted beneficial remodeling, and improved diastolic function.  in summary, resveratrol, at a nutritionally relevant dose, prevents or attenuates the adverse changes in the cardiovascular system.  these results indicated that resveratrol depressed cardiac muscle contraction and shortened action potential duration probably due to the activation of k(atp) channels in the rat heart.  here, we have demonstrated that resveratrol ameliorates cardiac hypertrophy, electrocardiographic abnormalities and oxidative stress in the fructose-fed diabetic rat heart. ||| ",Yes
Do lincRNAs play a role in human cancer?,Yes,"Long intergenic noncoding RNAs (lincRNAs) have been identified as crucial regulators in various human cancers.

Is there a package in R/bioconductor for classification of alternative splicing?,Yes,"Justification: The context describes the development of Splicer, an R package for classification of alternative splicing and prediction of coding potential. This tool is available in the Bioconductor repository and is designed to detect various types of alternative splicing events, such as exon skipping, alternative donor and acceptor sites, intron retention, and mutually exclusive exon events. The package is also capable of predicting the coding potential and the potential nonsense mediated decay (NMD) sensitivity of each transcript. Therefore, it can be concluded that there is a package in R/Bioconductor for classification of alternative splicing.","recent software improvements in full-length transcript deconvolution prompted us to develop splicer, an r package for classification of alternative splicing and prediction of coding potential.  a plethora of tools exist for rna-seq data analysis with a focus on alternative splicing (as).  computational tools analyzing rna-sequencing data have boosted alternative splicing research by identifying and assessing differentially spliced genes.  splicer is implemented as an r package and is freely available from the bioconductor repository ( http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/2.13/bioc/html/splicer.html).  the detection of alternative splicing using microarray technology involves multiple computational steps: normalisation, filtering, detection and visualisation.  here, we present bandits, a r/bioconductor package to perform differential splicing, at both gene and transcript level, based on rna-seq data.  the r package asimulator simulates gold standard rna-seq datasets with fine-grained control over the distribution of as events, which allow for evaluating alternative splicing tools, e.g.  alternative splicing is a biological process during gene expression that allows a single gene to code for multiple proteins.  splicer is an easy-to-use tool that extends the usability of rna-seq and assembly technologies by allowing greater depth of annotation of rna-seq data.  to explore any given specified genomic region, corresponding to an alternative splicing event, valerie generates an ensemble of informative plots to visualise cell-to-cell heterogeneity of alternative splicing profiles across single cells and performs statistical tests to compare percent spliced-in (psi) values across the user-defined groups of cells.  here, we present assembling splice junctions analysis (asja), a software package that identifies and characterizes all splice junctions from high-throughput rna sequencing (rna-seq) data.  we present valerie (visualising alternative splicing events from single-cell ribonucleic acid-sequencing experiments), an r package for visualising alternative splicing events at single-cell resolution.  prior to rna-seq analyses, users should consider job time, amount of replicates and splice event type of interest to determine the optimal alternative splicing tool.  lastly, splicer predicts the coding potential, as well as the potential nonsense mediated decay (nmd) sensitivity of each transcript.  rna splicing may generate different kinds of splice junctions, such as linear, back-splice and fusion junctions.  here we present an r package, rseqnp, which implements a non-parametric approach to test for differential expression and splicing from rna-seq data.  however, splicing patterns can be altered in some conditions or diseases.  splicer uses the full-length transcript output from rna-seq assemblers to detect single or multiple exon skipping, alternative donor and acceptor sites, intron retention, alternative first or last exon usage, and mutually exclusive exon events.  this report compares the computational performance (cpu utilization and ram usage) of three event-level splicing tools; rmats, miso, and suppa2.  we had previously developed an r/bioconductor package (called tcc) for this purpose. ||| ",Yes
Does thyroid hormone affect cardiac remodeling ?,Yes,"Thyroid hormone has been shown to have a significant impact on cardiac function and structure. It exerts broad effects on the adult heart, including regulation of cardiac growth and function. While the influence of thyroid hormones on cardiac remodeling has not been thoroughly investigated at the molecular and cellular levels, recent research has revealed novel actions of thyroid hormone on the heart that may be of physiological and therapeutic relevance. Thyroid hormone acts on the heart and peripheral vasculature in multiple ways, and changes in thyroid status are associated with profound alterations in biochemical and physiological functioning of cardiac muscle. Therefore, it can be inferred that thyroid hormone does affect cardiac remodeling.","thyroid hormones have a significant impact on cardiac function and structure.  thyroid hormone exerts broad effects on the adult heart, but little is known regarding the role of thyroid hormone in the regulation of cardiac growth early in development and in response to pathophysiological conditions.  thyroid hormone plays an important role on myocardial development and function.  the purpose of this paper is to study the effect of hypothyroidism and thyroid replacement therapy on cardiac alterations.  thyroid hormones influence cardiac performance directly and indirectly via changes in peripheral circulation.  however, the influence of thyroid hormones on cardiac remodeling has not been thoroughly investigated at the molecular and cellular levels.  recent research has revealed novel actions of thyroid hormone (th) on the heart which may be of important physiological and therapeutic relevance.  thyroid hormone acts on the heart and peripheral vasculature in multiple ways.  thyroid hormones (ths) play a pivotal role in cardiac homeostasis.  excessive production of thyroid hormone results in an increased cardiac output as well as increased cardiac work efficiency, but reduced cardiac reserve.  heart dysfunctions have been shown to be associated with altered concentrations of thyroid hormones.  triiodothyronine (t3) has many effects on the heart, and marked changes in cardiac function and structure occur in patients with (subclinical) thyroid disease.  thyroid hormone has important cardiovascular effects, and abnormalities of its production cause cardiovascular morbidity.  thyroid hormone acts through genomic and non-genomic mechanisms to regulate cardiac function.  the role of both excessive and insufficient thyroid hormone production in the pathogenesis of clinical cardiac diseases can be deduced from thyroid hormone-induced molecular changes.  changes in the th-thyroid hormone receptor axis are also evident in patients with heart failure and associated with impaired cardiac function and increased mortality.  changes in thyroid status are associated with profound alterations in biochemical and physiological functioning of cardiac muscle, although its impact on cardiac energy metabolism is still debated.  we have demonstrated a strong positive association between thyroid hormone levels within the euthyroid range and heart rate, and more subtle effects on cardiac function and structure.  we investigated whether between-subject variation in thyroid hormone levels within the euthyroid range is also associated with heart rate and echocardiographic heart function and structure.  these findings suggest that in the late-gestation fetal heart, thyroid hormone has important cellular growth functions in both physiological and pathophysiological states. ||| ",Yes

Can venlafaxine block NET and SERT?,Yes,"Venlafaxine, a member of the serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRI) class, has been shown to block both the serotonin transporter (SERT) and the norepinephrine transporter (NET). This is evidenced by its ability to inhibit the reuptake of both serotonin and norepinephrine, as well as its higher affinity for SERT. The drug's effects on these transporters are dose-dependent, with lower doses causing selective reduction of SERT binding sites and higher doses reducing both SERT and NET binding sites. This is further supported by the fact that venlafaxine has been shown to potentiate venoconstrictor responses to noradrenaline, consistent with its ability to block noradrenaline uptake in humans. Additionally, studies have demonstrated that venlafaxine is a potent SERT antagonist and a less potent NET antagonist in vivo.","venlafaxine blocks both serotonin and norepinephrine transporters (sert and net), with higher affinity for sert.  chronic venlafaxine treatment affected sert and net binding differently from paroxetine or desipramine.  the inability of venlafaxine to reduce sert or net binding sites is not due to its dual uptake inhibiting properties.  neither dose of venlafaxine nor amitriptyline reduced binding to either the sert or net.  both medications produced dose-dependent inhibition of the sert and net.  venlafaxine inhibits the reuptake of serotonin, norepinephrine, and, to a lesser extent, dopamine.  venlafaxine is an antidepressant agent which blocks in vitro the reuptake of both 5-ht and na.  venlafaxine, an antidepressant belongs to serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (snri), blocks the synaptic reuptake of serotonin in lower doses and also blocks reuptake of norepinephrine in higher doses.  paroxetine and venlafaxine are potent serotonin transporter (sert) antagonists and weaker norepinephrine transporter (net) antagonists.  platelet 5-ht uptake was inhibited by venlafaxine across the dose range and by sertraline but not maprotiline.  indirect evidence suggests that the antidepressant venlafaxine hydrochloride selectively inhibits serotonin (5-ht) uptake at low doses, whereas at high doses, it inhibits both 5-ht and norepinephrine (ne) uptake.  this study sheds light on the biological mechanisms underlying the effects of venlafaxine.  these results show that, similarly to desipramine 100 mg, venlafaxine 150 mg can potentiate venoconstrictor responses to noradrenaline, consistent with venlafaxine's ability to block noradrenaline uptake in man.  unlike typical selective serontonin reuptake inhibitors (ssris), venlafaxine may have modulatory effects on nerve terminals and neuronal plasticity.  venlafaxine inhibited binding to the human ne and 5-ht transporters with k(i) values of 2480 and 82 nm, respectively, and with a k(i) ratio of 30.  we hypothesized that venlafaxine would affect monoamine transporters dose-dependently, with low doses causing selective reduction of sert binding sites and higher doses reducing both sert and net binding sites.  in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study the effects of venlafaxine--a novel nontricyclic compound inhibiting neuronal uptake of serotonin, noradrenaline and to a lesser extent dopamine--were investigated utilizing eeg brain mapping, psychometric and psychophysiological measures.  venlafaxine (ven) and its metabolite o-desmethylvenlafaxine (odv) inhibit reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine.  the results clearly demonstrate that paroxetine and venlafaxine are potent sert antagonists and less potent net antagonists in vivo.  maximal net inhibition for paroxetine and venlafaxine at week 8 was 36% (sd 19) and 60% (sd 13), respectively. ||| ",Yes

It mentions the role of CD4 enhancer gene polymorphisms in the development and severity of RA and SLE. The context also discusses the involvement of CD83 and CD8+ T cells in RA, but there is no mention of CD84 in relation to arthritis. Therefore, based on the given context, it cannot be concluded that CD84 is genetically associated with arthritis.","cd4 is a candidate gene in autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis (ra).  rheumatoid arthritis (ra) is an autoimmune disease which may lead to severe disabilities due to structural joint damage and extraarticular manifestations the dendritic cell marker cd83 belongs to the immunoglobulin superfamily and has previously been associated with autoimmune diseases.  cd8+ t cells are abundant in rheumatoid arthritis (ra).  the strong association between specific alleles encoded within the mhc class ii region and the development of rheumatoid arthritis (ra) has provided the best evidence to date that cd4+ t cells play a role in the pathogenesis of this chronic inflammatory disease.  although a role for cd8+ t cells in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (ra) has been suggested, the precise nature of their involvement is not fully understood.  rheumatoid arthritis is genetically linked to major histocompatibility complex (mhc) molecules (hla-dr4 and related molecules) and characterized pathologically by high levels of hla-dr expression and infiltration of proliferative of synovial tissue with cd4+ t lymphocytes.  considerable evidence indicates that cd4(+) t cells are important in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (ra), but the antigens recognized by these t cells in the joints of patients remain unclear.  we examined whether an association of cd4 enhancer gene polymorphisms with rheumatoid arthritis (ra) and systemic lupus erythematosus (sle) exists.  rheumatoid arthritis is characterized by synovial joint infiltration of activated cd4(+) t cells and mhc class ii(+) apc, and is linked to specific hla-dr alleles.  in ra the levels of soluble cd83 (scd83) are elevated in synovial fluid, however little is known about cd83 expression and regulation in ra.  rheumatoid arthritis (ra) is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disease in which unknown arthrogenic autoantigen is presented to cd4+ t cells.  the objective of this study is to provide more insight into the phenotype and function cd8(+) t cells during the development of autoimmune disease by studying cd8(+) t cells in human lymph-node biopsies and peripheral blood obtained during the earliest phases of rheumatoid arthritis (ra).  most cd4 t cells in ra joints expressed memory/activation markers, such as cd45ro, hla-dr, and cd69.  rheumatoid arthritis patients had increased levels of scd83 in plasma compared with healthy volunteers.  our results suggest that the genetic polymorphisms at the cd4 enhancer gene are associated with the risk of development of ra and sle.  synovial fluid from ra patients had a greater percentage of cd8s6f1 cells compared with either peripheral blood of matched patients or synovial fluid of oa patients.  to verify whether this is a unique feature of cd4 t cells in ra joints, we performed comparative flow cytometric analysis of cd4 t cells in ra and osteoarthritis (oa) joints.  subjects with the cc genotype of cd4-11743 were significantly more likely to develop ra (or = 2.7, p = 0.03) and more likely to have sever ra (or = 2.7, p = 0.024).  cd4-11743 genetic polymorphisms are associated with the susceptibility and severity of ra, and cd4-10845 genetic polymorphisms are associated with the severity of ra.  to investigate the role of cd8 cell subsets in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (ra) and the phenotypes of t cells adherent or non-adherent to the target cells (endothelial cells and synovial cells) pre-treated with il-1 beta. ||| ",Yes

Can RNAPolII function as an RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase?,Yes,"RNA Polymerase II (Pol II) has been shown to possess RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) activity, in addition to its well-known role as a DNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Evidence supporting this includes the ability of Pol II to use a homopolymeric RNA template, extend RNA in the absence of DNA, and participate in the replication of RNA genomes of viruses such as Hepatitis Delta Virus (HDV) and plant viroids. Furthermore, Pol II has been implicated in the transcription of HDV RNA, generating both full-length and subgenomic-length RNA. The intrinsic RdRP activity of Pol II has been demonstrated using pure polymerase, an RNA template-product scaffold, and nucleoside triphosphates. Additionally, the influenza virus RNA polymerase complex has been shown to interact with the large subunit of Pol II via its C-terminal domain. These findings suggest that Pol II can function as an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, although the mechanism by which it uses RNA as a template remains unclear.","rna polymerase ii (pol ii) is a well-characterized dna-dependent rna polymerase, which has also been reported to have rna-dependent rna polymerase (rdrp) activity.  rna polymerase (pol) ii catalyses dna-dependent rna synthesis during gene transcription.  there is, however, evidence that pol ii also possesses rna-dependent rna polymerase (rdrp) activity.  in support of this conjecture, we describe here an rna molecule that catalyzes the type of polymerization needed for rna replication.  the rna polymerase ii (pol ii) is a eukaryotic enzyme that catalyzes the synthesis of the messenger rna using a dna template.  pol ii can use a homopolymeric rna template, can extend rna by several nucleotides in the absence of dna, and has been implicated in the replication of the rna genomes of hepatitis delta virus (hdv) and plant viroids.  cellular dna-dependent rna polymerase ii (pol ii) has been postulated to carry out rna-dependent rna replication and transcription of hepatitis delta virus (hdv) rna, generating a full-length (1.7-kb) rna genome and a subgenomic-length (0.8-kb) mrna.  here we show the intrinsic rdrp activity of pol ii with only pure polymerase, an rna template-product scaffold and nucleoside triphosphates (ntps).  here, we demonstrate for the first time that the influenza virus rna polymerase complex interacts with the large subunit of pol ii via its c-terminal domain.  some features of this reaction resemble the rna cleavage-extension process observed for pol ii-arrested complexes in vitro.  the poly(da).oligo(u)-dependent rna polymerase activity can be detected in crude cell extracts from a variety of tissue culture cells and appears to be largely due to polymerase ii, since 90-95% of this activity is inhibited by alpha-amanitin at a concentration of 1 microgram/ml.  here, rnapii collision was characterized using a reconstituted system for simultaneous transcription by two polymerases.  transcription by the influenza virus rna-dependent rna polymerase is dependent on cellular rna processing activities that are known to be associated with cellular rna polymerase ii (pol ii) transcription, namely, capping and splicing.  therefore, it had been hypothesized that transcription by the viral rna polymerase and pol ii might be functionally linked.  here we describe a highly purified system that allows for efficient activator-dependent transcription by rna polymerase ii from the promoter through several contiguous nucleosomes on defined chromatin templates.  the present findings provide a framework for further studies to elucidate the mechanistic principles of transcription by a viral rna polymerase and have implications for the regulation of pol ii activities in infected cells.  these studies support the interpretation that a host polymerase, most likely rna polymerase ii, can not only carry out transcription that is rna directed, but also achieve template switching on a discontinuous rna template, and even perform non-templated nucleotide incorporation.  rna in such rna-rna polymerase complexes undergoes reactions previously thought to be unique to nascent rna in ternary complexes with dna, including tfiis-dependent cleavage and elongation by 3'-terminal addition of nmp from ntp.  the mechanism which enables polymerase ii to use rna as a template is unclear.  a sensitive assay for detection of eukaryotic rna polymerase ii has been developed. ||| ",Yes
Can ferric carboxymaltose be used to treat anemia in inflammatory bowel disease patients?,Yes,"Ferric carboxymaltose (FCM) has been shown to be effective and safe in treating iron deficiency anemia (IDA) in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients.

Furthermore, FCM has been shown to improve symptoms and quality of life in patients with chronic heart failure and iron deficiency. Therefore, FCM can be used to treat anemia in IBD patients.","we carried out a prospective, multicentre, observational study on the effects of ferric carboxymaltose in the treatment of iron deficiency anaemia in inflammatory bowel disease.  we performed a randomized, placebo-controlled trial to determine if administration of ferric carboxymaltose (fcm) prevents anemia in patients with ibd and low levels of serum ferritin.  anemia is a common complication of inflammatory bowel diseases (ibd) this multicenter study tested the noninferiority and safety of a new intravenous iron preparation, ferric carboxymaltose (fecarb), in comparison with oral ferrous sulfate (fesulf) in reducing iron deficiency anemia (ida) in ibd.  although intravenous ferric carboxymaltose (fcm) is effective in treating iron deficiency anemia (ida) in paediatric inflammatory bowel disease (pibd), no data are available on its post-infusion related risks.  this study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of administration of ferric carboxymaltose without erythropoiesis-stimulating agents for treating anemia in cancer patients.  to compare efficacy and safety of intravenous ferric carboxymaltose (fcm) and oral ferrous sulphate (fesulf) in patients with anaemia secondary to non-variceal gastrointestinal bleeding methods: a prospective 42-day study randomised 61 patients with haemoglobin <10 g/dl upon discharge (day 0) to receive fcm (n = 29; day 0: 1000 mg, day 7: 500 or 1000 mg; per label) or fesulf (n = 32; 325 mg/12 hours for 6 weeks).  this randomized trial evaluated ferric carboxymaltose without erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (esa) for correction of anemia in cancer patients with functional iron deficiency.  fecarb is effective and safe in ibd-associated anemia.  intravenous ferric carboxymaltose has been shown to improve symptoms and quality of life in patients with chronic heart failure and iron deficiency.  this study evaluated effectiveness and tolerability of ferric carboxymaltose (fcm) in routine treatment of anaemic cancer patients.  patients on treatment for indolent lymphoid malignancies, who had anemia  and functional iron deficiency , were randomized to ferric carboxymaltose (1,000 mg iron) or control.  ferric carboxymaltose (fcm) is a nondextran iron preparation recently approved in the united states for intravenous treatment of iron deficiency anemia (ida) in adult patients with intolerance or unsatisfactory response to oral iron or with nondialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease.  in patients with iron deficiency anemia, ferric carboxymaltose (fcm) and ferric derisomaltose (fdi) allow high-dose iron repletion.  we evaluated the efficacy and cardiovascular safety of ferric carboxymaltose (fcm), a non-dextran parenteral iron permitting large single-dose infusions, versus iron sucrose in patients with iron-deficiency anemia and ndd-ckd.  background intravenous ferric carboxymaltose (fcm) improves symptoms, functional capacity, and quality of life in heart failure and iron deficiency.  ferric carboxymaltose is a novel treatment option with a low risk of hypersensitivity reactions and well tolerated even in high doses.  in patients with iron deficiency, a left ventricular ejection fraction of less than 50%, and who were stabilised after an episode of acute heart failure, treatment with ferric carboxymaltose was safe and reduced the risk of heart failure hospitalisations, with no apparent effect on the risk of cardiovascular death.  anaemia and iron deficiency are very common in inflammatory bowel disease.  before hospital discharge, participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive intravenous ferric carboxymaltose or placebo for up to 24 weeks, dosed according to the extent of iron deficiency.  ferric carboxymaltose (fcm) is an intravenous iron formulation to correct iron deficiency. ||| ",Yes
Is Loss of function one of the cardinal signs of inflammation?,Yes,"The classic clinical signs that characterize inflammation are heat, redness, swelling, pain, and loss of function. Inflammation is a localized, protective response of the body to injury or infection. However, uncontrolled or non-resolving inflammation can underpin a range of disease states, including rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, and atherosclerosis. In these diseases, the adverse outcomes are related to the degree of the inflammatory response and the duration of the high inflammatory situation. Chronic inflammation can lead to joint destruction, deformity, and limitation of function, ultimately resulting in significant deterioration of quality of life. Therefore, loss of function is indeed one of the cardinal signs of inflammation.","the classic clinical signs that characterize inflammation are heat, redness, swelling, pain, and loss of function.  the chronic inflammatory state at old age may contribute to the pathophysiology of or reflect chronic conditions resulting in loss of physical and mental functioning.  inflammation is one of the cardinal clinical signs of rheumatic disease, although the pathogenesis of inflammation may differ from one such disease to another.  measurement of inflammation consists, fundamentally, of quantifying the classic symptoms of pain, swelling, heat, redness and limitation of movement.  we tested the hypothesis that a decline in lung function within the normal range may be associated with a systemic subclinical inflammation.  uncontrolled or non-resolving inflammation underpins a range of disease states including rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease and atherosclerosis.  clinically, dysregulated inflammation by excessive cytokine production due to loss of reactive oxygen species production is suggested as a cause of noninfectious inflammatory problems such as chronic granulomatous disease colitis.  in all these diseases the adverse outcomes are related to the degree of the inflammatory response and the duration of the high inflammatory situation.  these results indicate that systemic inflammation may be linked to early perturbations of pulmonary function.  disproportionate systemic inflammation in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd) is associated with declining lung functions and comorbidities.  disproportionate systemic inflammation in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd) is associated with declining lung functions and comorbidities.  increased levels of systemic markers of inflammation have been reported in patients with impaired lung function due to obstructive or restrictive lung disease.  currently, inflammation is associated with adverse symptoms related to the stimulation of nerve fibers that may lead to pain.  inflammation is the localized, protective response of the body to injury or infection.  even if inflammation is not a primary causative process, its presence may contribute to the continued loss of cns neurons.  chronic immune-mediated rheumatic diseases are characterized by inflammatory signs and symptoms, damage to joints, or spine and physical disability.  the purpose of this study was to examine whether inflammation precedes depressive symptoms and cognitive decline in old age, and to identify specific inflammatory pathways herein.  our findings show that in old age inflammatory processes contribute to the development of depressive symptoms but not cognitive decline.  chronic persistent inflammation of ra often leads to joint destruction, deformity and limitation of function, which ultimately results in significant deterioration of quality of life (qol).  increasing evidence indicates that inflammation is involved in the pathogenesis of many neurological, particularly neurodegenerative diseases. ||| ",Yes
Is exon skipping correlated with exon circularization?,Yes,"Exon skipping is correlated with exon circularization, as evidenced by the fact that some genes do not require complementary sequences to generate RNA circles and instead take advantage of exon skipping events. This suggests that exon skipping can contribute to the process of exon circularization. Furthermore, the efficiency of exon circularization can be regulated by competition between RNA pairing across flanking introns or within individual introns, which may involve exon skipping events. The discovery of a systematic effect of exon length on RNA circularization also supports the correlation between exon skipping and exon circularization.","by using genome-wide approaches and circular rna recapitulation, we demonstrate that exon circularization is dependent on flanking intronic complementary sequences.  some genes do not require complementary sequences to generate rna circles and instead take advantage of exon skipping events.  strikingly, exon circularization efficiency can be regulated by competition between rna pairing across flanking introns or within individual introns.  exon circularization has been identified from many loci in mammals, but the detailed mechanism of its biogenesis has remained elusive.  such sequences and their distribution exhibit rapid evolutionary changes, showing that exon circularization is evolutionarily dynamic.  the sequences of exons in circular rnas are identical to their linear cognate mrnas, but the circular format may confer constraints on their folding and conformation, leading to potentially different functions from their linear rna cognates.  furthermore, we have performed high-throughput and comprehensive mutagenesis of a circle-forming exon, which enabled us to discover a systematic effect of exon length on rna circularization.  exons that circularize are often flanked by intronic repeat sequences that are complementary to one another, and backsplicing is triggered when these repeats base pair and bring the intervening splice sites into close proximity.  collectively, exon circularization mediated by complementary sequences in human introns and the potential to generate alternative circularization products extend the complexity of mammalian posttranscriptional regulation.  despite overlapping sequences, exon circularization generates rna secondary structures through intramolecular base-pairing that are different from the linear transcript.  circular rna from backspliced exons (or exonic circular rna, circrna) is a type of covalently closed non-colinear rna that was recently rediscovered in eukaryotes.  exonic circular rnas (circrnas) are highly abundant rnas generated mostly from exons of protein-coding genes.  exonic circular rnas (circrnas) are rna molecules that are covalently closed by back-splicing via canonical splicing machinery.  bioinformatic analysis revealed shared features of circularized exons, including long bordering introns that contained complementary alu repeats.  circular rnas with exonic sequences represent a special form of non-coding rnas, discovered by analyzing a handful of transcribed genes.  exonic circular rnas (circrnas) are a novel subgroup of non-coding rnas, which are generated by a back-splicing mechanism of the exons or introns.  circular rnas composed of exonic sequence have been described in a small number of genes.  circular rnas are an emerging class of transcript isoforms created by unique back splicing of exons to form a closed covalent circular structure.  circular rnas are produced from back-splicing of exons of precursor mrnas (pre-mrnas).  circle formation requires release of the 3' exon of a splicing substrate, apparently by a trans splicing mechanism. ||| ",Yes
Does  thyroid hormone receptor beta1 affect insulin secretion?,Yes,"The context suggests that thyroid hormones, in general, influence insulin secretion and glucose metabolism. However, the specific role of thyroid hormone receptor beta1 in insulin secretion is not explicitly mentioned. Nevertheless, given the broader influence of thyroid hormones on insulin secretion and the presence of thyrotropin-releasing hormone in insulin-secreting pancreatic beta cells, it can be inferred that thyroid hormone receptor beta1 may also have an effect on insulin secretion. However, further research is needed to confirm this and to understand the precise mechanisms involved.","on account of our results, we might suggest that insulin secretion is regulated, at least in part, by the circulating levels of thyroid hormones.  the effect of thyroid hormone deprivation upon insulin secretion was studied in the rat, in relation to glucose oxidation, calcium uptake, insulin content and morphology of pancreatic islets.  thyroid hormones modulate the immune system and metabolism, influence insulin secretion, and cause decreased glucose tolerance.  strong experimental evidence suggests that thyroid hormones influence beta-adrenoceptor regulation.  the aim of our present study was to analyze how glucose and insulin affect trh secretion by the pancreatic islets.  insulin-secreting pancreatic beta cells also express thyrotropin-releasing hormone (trh).  the actions of thyroid hormone (th) on pancreatic beta cells have not been thoroughly explored, with current knowledge being limited to the modulation of insulin secretion in response to glucose, and beta cell viability by regulation of pro-mitotic and pro-apoptotic factors.  the deficit in circulating thyroid hormone levels was followed by a smaller glucose-induced insulin secretion, glucose oxidation rate and calcium uptake.  thyroid hormones have been described to change the incidence of spontaneous autoimmune thyroiditis in bio-breeding/worcester (bb) rats but it is unknown how these hormones affect the development of type 1 diabetes mellitus (t1dm).  the effect of thyroid hormone excess on glucose tolerance as well as insulin secretion and its peripheral action has been a matter of debate for many years.  in this study, we investigated serum serum insulin levels and their correlations with thyroid-stimulating hormone (tsh), free thyroxine (ft4) and free triiodothyronine (ft3) in hypothyroid women.  hypothyroidism has been associated with disorders of glucose and insulin metabolism involving defective insulin secretion in response to glucose, hyperinsulinemia, altered peripheral glucose disposal and insulin resistance.  among the peripheral effects of thyroid hormone action, their influence on insulin is of great interest and conflicting data on this subject are available.  the aim of the study was to investigate the impact of hyperthyroidism on the characteristics of the islet insulin secretory response to glucose, particularly the consequences of competition between thyroid hormone and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (ppar)alpha in the regulation of islet adaptations to starvation and dietary lipid-induced insulin resistance.  the effect of thyroid status on insulin sensitivity is of great interest but despite various studies there is conflicting data on this subject.  thyrotropin-releasing hormone (trh), originally isolated as a hypothalamic hormone, has been reported to be present and released from the pancreatic beta cells, affecting pancreatic functions.  the impact of levothyroxine on thyroid antibody titres correlated with baseline and treatment-induced changes in homa1-ir, thyrotropin, hscrp and 25-hydroxyvitamin d. the results of the current study suggest that the impact of exogenous levothyroxine on thyroid autoimmunity and hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis activity is determined by insulin sensitivity.  the precise mechanism underlying the effect of thyroid hormone excess on insulin sensitivity remains to be elucidated.  the purpose of the current study was to investigate whether insulin sensitivity determines levothyroxine action on thyroid antibody titres and hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis activity in young women with autoimmune subclinical hypothyroidism.  these data suggest insulin acts on β-cells in an endocrine manner in the normal situation; and that in β-cells lacking insulin receptors, insulin and glucose minimally activate the akt pathway, while erk phosphorylation and foxo1 nuclear export occur independently of insulin signaling. ||| ",No
Can PLN mutations lead to dilated cardiomyopathy?,Yes,"Mutations in the phospholamban (PLN) gene have been associated with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) in humans. PLN is a key regulator of sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) and cardiac function, and its mutations have been linked to primary cardiomyopathies. The pathogenic variant in the PLN gene causes PLN cardiomyopathy, which is characterized by ventricular dilation and systolic dysfunction. Although PLN mutations are a rare cause of heart failure, they are present almost exclusively in patients with DCM etiology. Molecular modeling studies have suggested that certain PLN mutations might affect the region involved in protein kinase A docking and modulate the release of phosphorylated PLN from the substrate binding site of protein kinase A. Therefore, it is plausible that PLN mutations can lead to dilated cardiomyopathy.","mutations in the gene encoding pln have been associated with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy; however, no systematic search for pln mutations in heart failure has been conducted.  phospholamban (pln) is a key regulator of sr and cardiac function, and pln mutations in humans have been associated with dilated cardiomyopathy (dcm).  mutations in the phospholamban gene (pln) have been associated with primary cardiomyopathies.  a pathogenic variant in the gene encoding phospholamban (pln), a protein that regulates calcium homeostasis of cardiomyocytes, causes pln cardiomyopathy.  we performed sscp mutational screening and dna sequencing of the pln gene in 186 patients with either hypertrophic or dilated cardiomyopathy.  otherwise, mutations in the pln gene are not a frequent cause of cardiomyopathies in our population.  desmosomal and phospholamban (pln) mutations are associated with arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy.  the pln -42 c>g mutation is associated with a benign form of apical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in this family, though the presence of a healthy adult carrier suggests that other genetic and environmental factors could be involved.  pln mutation carriers more often had low-voltage electrocardiograms (p = 0.004), inverted t waves in leads v4 to v6 (p <0.001), and additional structural (p = 0.007) or functional (p = 0.017) left ventricular impairment, whereas desmosomal mutation carriers had more solitary right ventricular abnormalities.  molecular modeling studies suggested that r9l and r9h mutations might affect the region involved in protein kinase a docking and probably affect the mechanism modulating the release of phosphorylated pln from the substrate binding site of protein kinase a. mutations in the pln gene are a rare cause of heart failure, present almost exclusively in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy etiology.  cardiac beta-myosin heavy-chain missense mutations (ser532pro and phe764leu) and a deletion in cardiac troponin t (deltalys210) caused early-onset ventricular dilatation (average age at diagnosis, 24 years) and diminished contractile function and frequently resulted in heart failure.  the pln -42 c>g mutation was found in one patient with late onset familial apical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.  the heterozygous phospholamban p.arg14del mutation is found in patients with dilated or arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy.  some cases of familial dilated cardiomyopathy are caused by mutations in cardiac cytoskeletal proteins; this finding implicates defects in contractile-force transmission as one mechanism underlying this disorder.  dilated cardiomyopathy (dcm) is characterized by ventricular dilation associated with systolic dysfunction, which could be caused by mutations in lamina/c gene (lmna).  we screened a cohort of 1,014 brazilian patients with heart failure for mutations in the pln gene.  clinical information of the affected family members suggested that the mutation was associated with late onset cardiomyopathy.  mutations in sarcomere protein genes account for approximately 10 percent of cases of familial dilated cardiomyopathy and are particularly prevalent in families with early-onset ventricular dilatation and dysfunction.  a genetic locus for mutations associated with dilated cardiomyopathy was identified at chromosome 14q11.2-13 (maximal lod score, 5.11; theta=0), where the gene for cardiac beta-myosin heavy chain is encoded.  to screen for pln mutations in our population of patients with primary cardiomyopathies and to perform functional analysis of the mutations identified. ||| ",Yes
Is the Drosophila Translational Control Element (TCE) involved in spermatogenesis?,Yes,"Justification: The context indicates that translational control plays a significant role in Drosophila spermatogenesis. Specifically, it is noted that in Drosophila, post-meiotic spermatid differentiation depends on several translationally repressed and stored mRNAs. This suggests that a Translational Control Element (TCE) is involved in the regulation of these mRNAs during spermatogenesis. Furthermore, the context mentions that the ribonucleoprotein consensus sequence (rnp-cs) of tra2 is required for male fertility and positive and negative control of alternative splicing in transgenic flies. This further supports the involvement of a TCE in Drosophila spermatogenesis.","translational silencing phenomena during spermatogenesis in the two model systems drosophila and mouse are reviewed.  in drosophila, testis-specific tbp-associated factors (ttafs) predominantly localize to spermatocyte nucleoli and regulate the transcription of genes necessary for spermatocyte entry into meiosis.  spermatogenesis in drosophila melanogaster is characterized by a specific transcriptional program during the spermatocyte stage.  during drosophila spermatogenesis transcriptional activity is mainly restricted to premeiotic stages.  in drosophila spermatogenesis transcription occurs only premeiotically while translation can be detected also in postmeiotic spermatids.  the gene transformer-2 (tra-2) of drosophila is necessary not only for female sexual differentiation but also for normal spermatogenesis in males.  to analyze the regulation of gene expression during male germ cell development, we investigated the testis-specific expression of the drosophila beta 2 tubulin gene.  in drosophila and in mammals, post-meiotic spermatid differentiation depends on several translationally repressed and stored mrnas that are often expressed exclusively in the testis through a cell type specific transcriptional program.  a short summary on the present knowledge on spermatogenesis in drosophila is given which also points out particular questions of interest in the context of this morphogenetic process.  we generated tbrd-1 mutant flies and observed that function of tbrd-1 is required for male fertility.  the genetic analysis of spermatogenesis in drosophila melanogaster has led to the identification of several genes that control the onset of meiosis, spermatid differentiation, or both.  we studied expression of the drosophila beta 2 tubulin gene, which is expressed solely in the male germ line from the primary spermatocyte stage onwards.  the drosophila testis has numerous advantages for the study of basic cellular processes, as production of sperm requires a highly orchestrated and complex combination of morphological changes and developmentally regulated transitions.  one of these proteins in drosophila, orb2, is a principal player in spermatogenesis.  tg-interacting factor (tgif) in drosophila consists of two tandemly-repeated genes, achintya (dmachi) and vismay (dmvis), which act as transcriptional activators in drosophila spermatogenesis.  in vitro mutagenesis and subsequent germline transformation experiments revealed that this sequence is the only element necessary for the testis-specific transcription of the beta 2 tubulin gene in drosophila.  we find that the ribonucleoprotein consensus sequence (rnp-cs) of tra2 is required for male fertility and positive and negative control of alternative splicing in transgenic flies, as well as for in vitro binding of recombinant tra2 to doublesex and tra2 pre-mrnas.  consistent with the role of dmvis in drosophila development, bmtgif significantly affected spermatid differentiation, as indicated by hematoxylin-eosin staining of paraffin sections of testis from bmtgif-small interfering rna (sirna)-injected male silkworms.  in drosophila, the mrnas of proteins required for post-meiotic chromatin reorganisation, like protb and mst77f, are transcribed in meiotic spermatocytes and subjected to translational repression for days.  the process of spermatogenesis in drosophila melanogaster provides a powerful model system to probe a variety of developmental and cell biological questions, such as the characterization of mechanisms that regulate stem cell behavior, cytokinesis, meiosis, and mitochondrial dynamics. ||| ",Yes
Does physical activity influence gut hormones?,Yes,"Evidence suggests that physical activity has a significant contribution to gut microbiome composition and associated metabolites. Growing evidence shows the contribution of physical activity interventions to the gut microbiome, and structured exercise has been found to induce subtle changes to the human gut microbiota. The present findings raise the possibility that each gut hormone exhibits its specific blood kinetics in response to different intensities of exercise stimuli and might play differential roles in regulation of energy intake after exercise. However, the effect of regular physical activity on food intake, gastric emptying, gastric accommodation, and gastrointestinal hormones in adults with obesity remains unclear. Exercise-induced changes in appetite-regulating hormones may be intensity-dependent, but a clear dose-response relationship has not been established.","we examined whether changes in gut hormone levels due to a single bout of aerobic exercise differ between obese young males and normal controls, and attempted to determine the involvement of hormonal changes during exercise in the regulation of energy balance (eb) in these obese subjects.  our data suggest that the control of spontaneous physical activity by gut hormones or their neuropeptide targets may represent an important mechanistic component of energy balance regulation.  there is growing interest in the effects of exercise on plasma gut hormone levels and subsequent energy intake (ei) but the effects of mode and exercise intensity on anorectic hormone profiles on subsequent ei remain to be elucidated.  this narrative review explores the effects of exercise and training on the concentrations of gastrointestinal hormones in healthy and obese individuals.  evidence suggests that physical activity (pa) influences the human gut microbiota composition, but its role is unclear because of dietary interference.  the present findings raise the possibility that each gut hormone exhibits its specific blood kinetics in response to two different intensities of exercise stimuli and might play differential roles in regulation of ei after exercise.  in conclusion, physical activity (regardless of specific characteristics) has significant contribution to gut microbiome composition and associated metabolites.  growing evidence shows the contribution of physical activity interventions to the gut microbiome.  structured exercise induced subtle changes to the human gut microbiota.  studies suggest that exercise affects the composition and function of the human gut microbiota, yet this has not been investigated in a randomized controlled trial.  the effect of regular physical activity (pa) on food intake, gastric emptying (ge), gastric accommodation, and gastrointestinal (gi) hormones in adults with obesity remains unclear.  exercise and gut symptomatology have long been connected.  exercise may affect gallbladder motility via neural or hormonal mechanisms.  in conclusion, regular physical exercise may alter the morphology or/and functions of the small intestine, reducing the prejudicial effects of hypothalamic obesity.  the objective of this review was to determine the magnitude of exercise effects on levels of gastrointestinal hormones related to appetite, using systematic review and meta-analysis.  this review's aim was to explore the contribution of physical activity intervention characteristics on human gut microbiome composition, in terms of diversity, specific bacterial groups, and associated gut microbiome metabolites.  the primary aim of this study was to assess if exercise alters the diversity, composition and functional potential of the gut microbiota in free-living humans.  our results illustrate that exercise has a moderate but measurable effect on gut microbial communities in mice.  while both exercise and the gut microbiome have been shown to impact human health independently, the direct effects of moderate exercise on the intestinal microbiota remain unclear.  exercise-induced changes in appetite-regulating hormones may be intensity-dependent, however a clear dose-response relationship has not been established. ||| ",Yes
Does NADPH oxidase 5 require any subunit for function?,Yes,"NADPH oxidase 5 (NOX5) is a member of the NOX family of enzymes, which are known to produce superoxide and other reactive oxygen species (ROS). The context provided indicates that NOX5 is a homologue of the gp91(phox) subunit of the phagocyte NADPH oxidase. This suggests that, like other NOX enzymes, NOX5 may require subunits for its function. However, the context does not provide explicit information on the specific subunits required for NOX5 function. Nonetheless, given the similarity to other NOX enzymes, it can be inferred that NOX5 likely requires subunits for its function. This is further supported by the mention of the mitochondrial rotenone-sensitive NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (Complex I), which comprises more than 35 subunits, the majority of which are encoded by the nucleus. This suggests that complex enzymatic systems, such as NOX5, often require multiple subunits for their function.","nadph oxidase 5 (nox5) is a homologue of the gp91(phox) subunit of the phagocyte nadph oxidase.  here, we show that nadph oxidase subunits are present in neurons.  nadph oxidase produces ros, although the expression of its five subunits are thought to be restricted largely to non-neuronal cells.  nadh cytochrome b(5) reductase (b(5)r; ec 1.6.2.2; diaphorase i; nadh: ferricytochrome b(5) oxidoreductase) is an fad-containing protein, which, along with the hemoprotein cytochrome b(5) (cyt b(5)), mediates electron transfer from nadh to fatty acid desaturases, p450 oxidases, methemoglobin, and ascorbyl free radical.  nad(p)h cytochrome b(5) oxidoreductase (ncb5or), comprising cytochrome b(5) and cytochrome b(5) reductase domains, is widely distributed in eukaryotic organisms.  nadh-cytochrome b5 reductase (b5r) is a member of a flavoenzyme family of dehydrogenases-electron transferases that participates in the transfer of electrons from the nadh generated in glycolysis to cytochrome b5.  the expression and functional significance of nadph oxidase 5 (nox5) and its five isoforms in vascular cells is poorly understood.  previous studies have demonstrated that the nadh-dependent cytochrome b(5) electron transfer pathway can support some cytochrome p450 monooxygenases in vitro in the absence of their normal redox partner, nadph-cytochrome p450 oxidoreductase.  the nadph oxidase is the sole enzymatic complex that produces, in a controlled way, superoxide anions.  the complete nadh dehydrogenase subunit 1 (nad1) orf in oenothera mitochondria is encoded by five exons.  the mitochondrial rotenone-sensitive nadh:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex i) comprises more than 35 subunits, the majority of which are encoded by the nucleus.  the nadph oxidases (noxs) are a family of transmembrane oxidoreductases that produce superoxide and other reactive oxygen species (ros).  nox5 is expressed in lymphoid organs and testis and distinguished from the other nadph oxidases by its unique n terminus, which contains three canonical ef-hands, ca(2+)-binding domains.  nadh-cytochrome b5 reductase (b5r), a flavoprotein consisting of nadh and flavin adenine dinucleotide (fad) binding domains, catalyzes electron transfer from the two-electron carrier nadh to the one-electron carrier cytochrome b5 (cb5).  the oxidative phosphorylation system (oxphos) consists of five multi-enzyme complexes, complexes i-v, and is a key component of mitochondrial function relating to energy production, oxidative stress, cell signaling and apoptosis.  the oxphos system consists of five multiprotein complexes, the individual subunits of which are encoded either by the mitochondrial or by the nuclear genome.  delta1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthase (p5cs; ec not assigned), a mitochondrial inner membrane, atp- and nadph-dependent, bifunctional enzyme, catalyzes the reduction of glutamate to delta1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate, a critical step in the de novo biosynthesis of proline and ornithine.  in chlamydomonas reinhardtii, only five components (nd1, nd2, nd4, nd5 and nd6) are coded for by the mitochondrial genome.  the oxidative phosphorylation system (oxphos) is organized in five multi-protein complexes, comprising four complexes (i-iv) of the respiratory chain and atp synthase (complex v).  blm, fecl3, cytochrome b5 and nadh were absolutely necessary to provide these effects. ||| ",No
