Is the protein Papilin secreted?,Yes,"Justification: The context mentions that the rat pancreatitis-associated protein (pap) is a 16 kDa secretory protein. This indicates that pap is a protein that is secreted from cells, as it is found in the pancreatic juice after induction of pancreatic inflammation. The context also states that pap is synthesized as a preprotein with a predicted molecular weight of 16,630, further supporting the idea that it is a secretory protein. Therefore, based on the information provided, it can be concluded that pap is a secreted protein.",Yes
Are long non coding RNAs spliced?,Yes,"Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) can indeed undergo splicing, although it is not a universal feature of all lncRNAs. The splicing process involves the removal of introns and the joining of exons, which is a common feature in the maturation of messenger RNAs (mRNAs). While some lncRNAs share structural similarities with mRNAs, including the presence of a 5' cap and a poly-A tail, not all lncRNAs exhibit these features. However, those that do can undergo splicing, contributing to their functional diversity and regulatory roles in transcriptional, post-translational, and epigenetic processes.",Yes
Is RANKL secreted from the cells?,Yes,"Justification: The context indicates that RANKL is predominantly localized in lysosomal organelles, specifically secretory lysosomes, in osteoblastic cells. Furthermore, it is shown that RANKL translocates to the cell surface in response to stimulation with RANK-FC-conjugated beads. This translocation suggests that RANKL is secreted from the cells, as it moves from the intracellular compartment to the plasma membrane. Additionally, the context mentions that knockdown of vps33a expression reduced the lysosomal storage of RANKL and caused the accumulation of newly synthesized RANKL in the Golgi apparatus, indicating that vps33a is involved in transporting RANKL from the Golgi apparatus to secretory lysosomes. This further supports the notion that RANKL is secreted from the cells.",Yes
Does metformin interfere thyroxine absorption?,No,"Metformin does not appear to interfere with thyroxine absorption. In both study groups, metformin treatment exerted a neutral effect on free and total thyroxine and triiodothyronine. This suggests that metformin does not significantly impact the absorption of thyroxine. Furthermore, metformin was found to reduce elevated thyrotropin levels in subjects with hypothyroidism, indicating that it does not interfere with thyroid function. The impact of metformin on thyrotropin levels is sex-dependent, but it does not appear to be related to thyroxine absorption. Therefore, based on the available evidence, it can be concluded that metformin does not interfere with thyroxine absorption.",Yes
Has Denosumab (Prolia) been approved by FDA?,Yes,"Denosumab (Prolia), a human recombinant monoclonal antibody, has indeed been approved by the FDA. It received approval in 2010 for the treatment of osteoporosis, specifically in postmenopausal women who are at high risk of fracture. This includes patients who have not responded well to other available osteoporosis therapies or have been intolerant to them. The drug targets the receptor activator of nuclear factor-ÎºB ligand (RANKL), which plays a crucial role in bone resorption. Denosumab interferes with the formation, activation, and survival of osteoclasts, the cells responsible for bone resorption, thereby helping to maintain bone density and strength.",Yes
Is the monoclonal antibody Trastuzumab (Herceptin) of potential use in the treatment of prostate cancer?,Yes,", with limitations.

Trastuzumab (Herceptin) has been studied for potential use in the treatment of prostate cancer, specifically in advanced hormone-refractory prostate cancer (HRPC). The humanized monoclonal antibody is directed against the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), which has been implicated in the oncogenesis of human prostate cancer. A phase I study evaluated the combination of docetaxel/estramustine and trastuzumab in patients with metastatic androgen-independent prostate cancer (AIPC). However, trastuzumab as a single agent demonstrated poor efficacy in treating HRPC. Further studies are needed to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of trastuzumab in combination with other therapies for the treatment of prostate cancer.",Yes
Are transcription and splicing connected?,Yes,"Transcription and splicing are intrinsically connected processes in eukaryotic cells, as evidenced by numerous studies. Splicing is a co-transcriptional process, meaning it occurs during transcription, and is coupled to transcription in organisms such as Drosophila, yeast, and mammals. The functional coupling of transcription and splicing has been reported both in vivo and in vitro, with nascent transcripts undergoing splicing in the vicinity of chromatin while still attached to the RNA polymerase II transcriptional machinery. Splicing factors have been shown to directly promote transcriptional elongation, demonstrating a more intimate coupling between transcription and splicing than previously thought. The presence of transcription factors in the spliceosome and proteins with dual activities in splicing and transcription further support the links between these processes. Although the molecular mechanisms governing these interactions remain largely unknown, it is clear that transcription and splicing are tightly connected and play a crucial role in gene expression regulation in eukaryotes.",Yes
Is Alu hypomethylation associated with breast cancer?,Yes,"Global DNA hypomethylation has been identified as a major event in the development and progression of cancer, including breast cancer. Aberrant DNA methylation, such as promoter hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes, has been recognized as a contributing factor to breast carcinogenesis. Although widespread hypomethylation and regional hypermethylation may not be involved in the early stages of breast cancer, DNA hypomethylation, including Alu hypomethylation, has been associated with breast cancer risk. Global genomic hypomethylation is a hallmark of cancer in humans, and Alu hypomethylation has been shown to correlate with tumor and serum samples. Therefore, the findings suggest that Alu hypomethylation is independently associated with the development of breast cancer.",Yes
Proteomic analyses need prior knowledge of the organism complete genome. Is the complete genome of the bacteria of the genus Arthrobacter available?,Yes,"The availability of the complete genome sequence of bacteria, including those of the genus Arthrobacter, has significantly increased over the past few years. This has been facilitated by the advent of high-throughput sequencing technologies, which have enabled the sequencing of bacterial genomes in a matter of hours. The complete genome sequencing of a bacterial genome often reveals a substantial number of unique genes, which can be used for its taxonomic classification. In this context, hundreds of bacterial genome sequences are now available for comparative genomics, and the proteomic tools can establish a complete list of the most abundant proteins present in a sample, providing the opportunity to study the physiology of any bacteria for which the genome sequence is available. Therefore, it can be inferred that the complete genome of the bacteria of the genus Arthrobacter is available.",Yes
Do mutations of AKT1 occur in meningiomas?,Yes,"Mutations of AKT1 have been identified in meningiomas, as reported in recent genomic research. Specifically, the akt1e17k mutation has been observed exclusively in meningiomas, occurring in 65 out of 958 tumors. This mutation has been associated with earlier tumor recurrence and is found predominantly in meningiomas located at the convexity and skull base. The activation of AKT1 kinase by the e17k mutation has been demonstrated through western blot analysis in human meningioma samples and in vitro and in vivo models. Furthermore, AKT1 mutations have been correlated with certain pathological subtypes, locations, and clinical observations in meningiomas. Therefore, it can be concluded that mutations of AKT1 do occur in meningiomas.",Yes
Does physical activity influence gut hormones?,Yes,"Physical activity has been shown to influence gut hormones, as evidenced by changes in their levels following exercise. Gut hormones, such as ghrelin, peptide YY (PYY), and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), play a crucial role in regulating appetite and energy balance. Research has demonstrated that a single bout of aerobic exercise can lead to alterations in gut hormone levels, with potential differences observed between obese individuals and normal controls. Moreover, the effects of exercise on gut hormones may vary depending on the mode and intensity of physical activity. While the specific mechanisms underlying these changes remain to be fully elucidated, it is clear that physical activity has a significant contribution to gut hormone regulation and energy balance.",Yes
Is irritable bowel syndrome more common in women with endometriosis?,Yes,"Evidence suggests that irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is indeed more common in women with endometriosis. A study found that women with endometriosis were 3.5 times more likely to have received a diagnosis of IBS compared to those without endometriosis. The prevalence of IBS was higher in women with endometriosis compared to women without endometriosis. Furthermore, patients with minimal to mild and moderate to severe endometriosis had a higher prevalence of symptoms consistent with IBS. These findings indicate a strong association between endometriosis and IBS, suggesting that IBS is more common in women with endometriosis.",Yes
Does BNP increase after intensive exercise in athletes?,Yes,"Justification: Numerous studies have demonstrated a rise in brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels following prolonged and/or strenuous exercise. Healthy athletes have shown increased BNP concentrations following exercise, with a statistically significant increase (p=0.0017) in BNP concentrations immediately after exercise compared to baseline values. This trend of elevated BNP levels continues for at least one hour post-exercise before returning to baseline at two hours. In marathoners, BNP levels were found to be elevated immediately after the race and also after four hours. Furthermore, in a study of 191 participants, serum BNP concentrations were measured before and immediately after four consecutive days of walking exercise, further supporting the claim that BNP increases after intensive exercise in athletes.",Yes
Are there web based self management strategies for chronic pain ?,Yes,"Internet-based interventions have demonstrated efficacy in promoting self-management of chronic pain conditions. These interventions often employ cognitive behavioral approaches and can be delivered via web-based pain management programs. Such programs have shown clinical effectiveness in improving emotional management, coping, self-efficacy to manage pain, pain levels, and physical functioning. Additionally, they may address access barriers to care. Mobile and web technologies are increasingly utilized to support the treatment of chronic pain conditions. Health care providers have also recognized the potential of digital self-management interventions in supporting patients living with chronic pain. However, research on web-based interventions to support self-management following participation in pain management programs is limited, and little is known about their long-term effects. Clinicians may refer patients to top-ranked websites for enabling self-management skills, although most websites lack cultural tailoring and have limited or no evidence of clinical efficacy.",Yes
Is Weaver syndrome similar to Sotos?,Yes,"Justification: The context suggests a significant phenotypic overlap between Weaver and Sotos syndromes. Both are characterized by generalized overgrowth, macrocephaly, specific facial features, accelerated bone age, and intellectual disability. The primary differentiating factor is the presence of NSD1 mutations, which are the major cause of Sotos syndrome and account for some Weaver syndrome cases. However, the molecular basis of most Weaver syndrome cases remains unknown. Despite some distinct features, such as camptodactyly being more common in Weaver syndrome, the overall presentation and manifestations of both syndromes are similar. Therefore, it can be concluded that Weaver syndrome is similar to Sotos syndrome.",Yes
Are ultraconserved elements often transcribed?,Yes,"Ultraconserved elements can indeed be transcribed, as evidenced by the existence of transcribed ultraconserved regions (t-UCRs). These t-UCRs are a novel class of long noncoding RNAs that are transcribed from ultraconserved regions (UCRs) and exhibit 100% DNA sequence conservation among humans, mice, and rats. UCRs are non-protein coding gene sequences that are strictly conserved across different species. The transcribed UCRs serve as regulators of gene expression, highlighting their functional significance. However, it is important to note that not all ultraconserved elements are transcribed, as some may have other roles, such as acting as tissue-specific enhancers or being involved in the regulation of gene expression through alternative splicing.",Yes
Is peripheral neuroepithelioma related to Ewing sarcoma?,Yes,"Justification: Peripheral neuroepithelioma, also known as peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumor (pPNET), is closely related to Ewing sarcoma (ES). Both tumors belong to the Ewing sarcoma family of tumors (ESFT), which are characterized by small, round, undifferentiated cells. They share similar histological features, genetic alterations, and clinical behavior. Recent studies have suggested a relationship between these tumors and an unusual form of childhood neural tumor, often termed peripheral neuroepithelioma or primitive neuroectodermal tumor. The evidence indicates that both tumors possess a neural histogenesis, further supporting their close relationship. In summary, peripheral neuroepithelioma is a highly aggressive small round cell tumor belonging to the pPNET/Ewing sarcoma family, and it is considered to be a different manifestation of the same entity as Ewing sarcoma.",Yes
Is c-met involved in the activation of the Akt pathway?,Yes,"Justification: The c-Met receptor tyrosine kinase is known to activate several downstream signaling pathways, including the Akt pathway. Upon binding of its ligand, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), c-Met activates downstream pathways that are important in organ development and cancer progression. One of these pathways is the PI3K/Akt pathway, which is activated through the direct targeting of Akt by PI3K. Aberrant c-Met activation has been found to induce tumor development, migration, invasion, and metastasis, and the PI3K/Akt pathway is one of the downstream pathways that contributes to these processes. In addition, inhibition of autophosphorylated c-Met has been shown to suppress downstream Akt and c-Src pathways, further supporting the involvement of c-Met in the activation of the Akt pathway.",No
Is pregnancy an additional risk during during H1N1 infection?,Yes,"Justification: Pregnancy is identified as a major risk factor for increased mortality and morbidity due to H1N1 influenza. Emerging data suggest that pregnant women and their offspring are at an increased risk for influenza-related complications. Pregnant women infected with H1N1 influenza may experience severe illness, premature delivery, and other adverse outcomes. Immunological and hormonal alterations during pregnancy place women at increased risk for influenza-related severe illnesses, including hospitalization and death. Furthermore, pregnant women infected with HIV may have particular vulnerability to H1N1 influenza infection. In summary, pregnancy is an additional risk factor during H1N1 infection, as it increases the likelihood of severe complications and adverse outcomes.",No
Are long non coding RNAs as conserved in sequence as protein coding genes?,No,"Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are not as conserved in sequence as protein-coding genes. Unlike protein-coding genes, lncRNAs tend to preserve their regulatory machinery rather than their transcribed sequence. While a small portion of human lncRNAs appear to be conserved outside of mammals, the poor sequence conservation of long non-coding genes makes the identification of their homologs a challenging task. In contrast, protein-coding genes exhibit higher sequence conservation, which facilitates the identification of homologs across species. Therefore, it can be concluded that lncRNAs are not as conserved in sequence as protein-coding genes.",No
Is TENS machine effective in pain?,Yes,", with caveats

Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) has been reported to alleviate pain in both acute and chronic conditions, with healthcare professionals frequently employing it for pain modulation and management. TENS is a noninvasive, nonpharmacological method that utilizes electrical currents to stimulate nerves, thereby reducing pain perception. Its application has been shown to decrease pain intensity and unpleasantness in comparison to baseline levels. However, the clinical efficacy of TENS remains controversial, as its effects on various pain and function measures are unclear. While many studies have indicated that high-frequency, nonpainful TENS can reduce clinical pain, controlled studies have produced conflicting results regarding its ability to modulate experimental pain. Therefore, it is possible that TENS may be effective for some pain measures but not for others.",Yes
Is there any algorithm for enhancer identification from chromatin state?,Yes,"The context suggests that several algorithms and computational methods have been developed to identify enhancers based on chromatin states. These methods include machine learning tools such as CSI-ANN, ChromHMM, and RFESC, which use various epigenetic features to predict enhancers. Additionally, an algorithm called REPTILE has been proposed, which integrates histone modification and whole-genome cytosine DNA methylation profiles to identify the precise location of enhancers. Furthermore, a novel two-layer enhancer predictor called iEnhancer-KL has been proposed to classify enhancers into strong or weak types. These algorithms and methods have been developed to address the prevailing problem of enhancer identification in computational biology and to improve our understanding of transcriptional regulation during development and disease.",Yes
Are transcribed ultraconserved regions involved in cancer?,Yes,"Justification: Transcribed ultraconserved regions (T-UCRs) are a novel class of long non-coding RNAs that are absolutely conserved across species and have been shown to play functional roles in the pathophysiology of multiple cancers. T-UCRs are often deregulated in cancer and encode long non-coding RNAs implicated in human carcinogenesis. These T-UCRs are frequently located at fragile sites and genomic regions involved in cancers. Deregulation of specific T-UCRs, such as uc160, uc283, and uc346, has been reported in colorectal cancer. Additionally, the expression of ultraconserved RNAs (ucRNAs) has been evaluated in hepatocellular cancer, where the greatest change was noted for ultraconserved element 338 (uc.338). T-UCRs have tissue-specific expression and play relevant roles in the pathophysiology of multiple cancer types, including breast cancer. Aberrant expression of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), including those mapped on T-UCRs, has been detected in several types of cancer. Therefore, it can be concluded that transcribed ultraconserved regions are indeed involved in cancer.",No
Do patients with Pendred syndrome present congenital deafness?,Yes,"Patients with Pendred syndrome, an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the SLC26A4 gene, present with congenital sensorineural deafness. This hearing impairment is characterized by a profound, early-onset hearing loss, often accompanied by enlarged vestibular aqueducts. The disorder is one of the most common hereditary determined diseases in patients with syndromic sensorineural hearing impairment. In addition to congenital deafness, Pendred syndrome is also characterized by goiter and defective iodide organification, with a positive perchlorate challenge. The molecular basis of the association between the hearing loss and the thyroid organification defect remains unknown.",Yes
Is CD56 useful in Ewing sarcoma prognosis?,Yes,"The expression of CD56 has been identified in Ewing's Sarcoma (ES) and primitive neuroectodermal tumors (PNET), and its utility as a prognostic marker has been investigated. CD56 was found to be an independent prognostic marker with an 11-fold increased risk for relapse in patients with localized disease. CD56 expression could be used to reveal ES patients with excellent prognosis or patients predisposed to relapse, thus improving treatment stratification and implementation of personalized therapy. The presence of CD56 expression was also evaluated in bone marrow samples of ES patients at diagnosis using multiparameter flow cytometry (MPFC) to determine its prognostic significance. Therefore, CD56 expression can be considered a useful prognostic marker in Ewing Sarcoma.",Yes
Are there any urine biomarkers for chronic kidney disease?,Yes,"Justification: The context indicates that there are several urine biomarkers for chronic kidney disease (CKD). These include urinary proteomic analyses, which have shown high diagnostic accuracy for CKD, including hypertensive nephropathy, and improved identification of patients with rapid kidney function decline beyond albuminuria testing. Urine levels of NGAL, a marker of renal tubular injury, have been associated with future ischemic atherosclerotic events in patients with CKD. Urinary nephrin is a potential non-invasive biomarker of disease. Urinary cystatin C (u-CysC) is a new biomarker for acute tubular kidney dysfunction and may also indicate chronic tubular dysfunction. The protein:creatinine ratio in spot morning urine samples is a precise indicator of proteinuria and a reliable predictor of progression of disease in non-diabetic patients with chronic nephropathies. Furthermore, urinary nephrin-to-creatinine ratio level has been suggested to be a useful and reliable biomarker for predicting the amelioration of podocyte dysfunction by candidate drugs in various kidney disease models with podocyte dysfunction. However, it is important to note that there is no commercial surveillance technology to definitively diagnose and quantify the severity and progressive loss of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in CKD.",Yes
Is valproic acid effective for glioblastoma treatment?,Yes,"Valproic acid (VPA), an established antiepileptic drug, has been investigated for its potential anticancer properties in various tumors, including malignant gliomas. Retrospective evidence suggests that VPA is associated with improved outcomes in glioblastoma (GBM) patients. VPA is a histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) that has been shown to enhance overall survival and progression-free survival in newly diagnosed GBM patients. Furthermore, VPA has been found to have antitumor effects on gliomas, and it can modulate the biologic effects of radiation therapy. In vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated that VPA directly or synergistically exerts inhibitory effects on glioma cells, decreasing cell proliferation and sensitizing GBM cells to radiation. Although the exact role of VPA in GBM treatment is not yet fully determined, these findings suggest that it may represent a novel therapeutic option for GBM patients.",No
Can Levoxyl (levothyroxine sodium) cause insomnia?,No,"Levothyroxine sodium, such as Levoxyl, is primarily used for the treatment of hypothyroidism and is not typically associated with causing insomnia. In fact, studies have shown that levothyroxine can improve excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) and prolonged nocturnal sleep time in euthyroid patients with narcolepsy without cataplexy. A pilot study demonstrated that levothyroxine intake at bedtime significantly improved thyroid hormone levels without causing insomnia or other adverse effects. However, it is important to note that levothyroxine has a narrow therapeutic index, and both underdosage and excessive dosage can lead to adverse symptoms. Therefore, it is recommended that levothyroxine be taken in the morning on an empty stomach to ensure optimal absorption and therapeutic efficacy. In summary, there is no evidence to suggest that Levoxyl (levothyroxine sodium) causes insomnia.",Yes
Is fatigue prevalent in patients receiving treatment for glioblastoma?,Yes,"Fatigue is a prevalent symptom in patients receiving treatment for glioblastoma. According to various studies, fatigue is a commonly reported, severe symptom among patients with gliomas throughout the disease trajectory. It is observed both pre- and postoperatively in patients with diffuse glioma. Furthermore, fatigue is a frequent experience during treatment for recurrent high-grade glioma (HGG) and impacts the quality of life (QoL) of patients undergoing radiotherapy (RT). The prevalence of fatigue in glioblastoma patients is significantly higher than in healthy controls (48% vs 11%; p < .001). Tiredness in glioblastoma patients may be caused by the brain injury due to the tumor or the treatment. Therefore, it can be concluded that fatigue is a prevalent symptom in patients receiving treatment for glioblastoma.",Yes
Have Quantitative Trait Loci affecting splicing (splicing QTLs) been linked to disease?,Yes,"Evidence from recent studies has demonstrated a significant link between Quantitative Trait Loci affecting splicing (splicing QTLs) and disease. These genetic variants, known as Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs), play a crucial role in regulating RNA splicing and transcript usage. SNPs in splicing regulatory elements have been hypothesized to contribute to the etiology of complex diseases by regulating gene splicing and affecting the ratios of alternative transcripts. Notably, 40% of sqtl-associated genes undergo alternative splicing, and DNA variants that affect alternative splicing and the relative quantities of different gene transcripts have been identified as risk alleles for some Mendelian diseases.

Furthermore, splicing QTLs have been investigated in the context of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), revealing that SNPs in a known COPD GWAS locus on chromosome 5q32 influence alternative splicing in the gene FBXO38. This discovery underscores the potential of genome-wide RNA splicing analysis in identifying variations that drive specific diseases and alter susceptibility to drug responses, including tissue-specific toxicities.

In summary, the available evidence from splicing quantitative trait locus (sqtl) studies, although limited to small samples, indicates that analysis of alternative splicing can provide novel insights into disease mechanisms and contribute to a better understanding of susceptibilities related to rare drug-induced toxicities.",Yes
Does the CTCF protein co-localize with cohesin?,Yes,"The CTCF protein co-localizes with cohesin, as evidenced by the direct interaction between specific regions of the C-terminal tail of CTCF and the SA2 subunit of the cohesin complex. This interaction is essential for cohesin binding and insulator function, and it contributes to the positioning of cohesin at CTCF binding sites. Cohesin frequently co-localizes with CTCF in mammalian genomes, and their binding is largely mediated by CTCF or the mediator complex. The recruitment of the cohesin complex to chromatin via CTCF is required for CTCF-anchored loops and insulator activity. Additionally, sites of co-occupancy between CTCF and cohesin are enriched in gene promoters in HSPC and erythroid cells. These findings suggest that the co-localization of CTCF and cohesin plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including transcription, maintenance of chromatin domain architecture, and insulator function.",Yes
Are stress granules involved in the pathogenesis of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis?,Yes,"Stress granules (SGs) are implicated in the pathogenesis of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). SGs form during cellular stress and contain various neuropathogenic proteins, including TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43). Recent evidence suggests that SGs may aid the formation of ALS protein aggregates, and prolonged SG dysfunction may contribute directly to ALS. Many genes whose mutation causes ALS encode RNA-binding proteins that localize to SGs, while others impact the assembly, stability, and elimination of SGs. Alterations in SG dynamics and RNA biology have been hypothesized to cause ALS. In human ALS spinal cord neurons, abnormal accumulation of poly(A)-binding protein (PABP) suggests prolonged SG dysfunction may contribute to pathogenesis. ALS-linked Fused in Sarcoma/Translocated in Liposarcoma (FUS/TLS or FUS) is concentrated within cytoplasmic SGs under induced stress conditions. Activation of the integrated stress response (ISR), alterations in nucleo-cytoplasmic transport, and changes in alternative splicing regulation are common traits of ALS pathogenesis. ALS is characterized by the progressive loss of motor neurons and the accumulation of misfolded protein aggregates, including cytoplasmic ubiquitinated TDP-43 protein aggregates in motor neurons. SOD1 harboring ALS-linked mutations is recruited to SGs, induces changes in alternative splicing, and could be an RNA-binding protein. TDP-43 mutations associated with ALS modulate the rates of SG formation and disassembly, suggesting that this may be an early event in the seeding of insoluble cytoplasmic inclusions observed in ALS.",Yes
Does TGF-beta play a role in cardiac regeneration after myocardial infarction?,Yes,"Transforming Growth Factor (TGF)-beta plays a significant role in cardiac regeneration after myocardial infarction. It is a locally generated cytokine involved in healing processes and tissue fibrosis, which are relevant for cardiac remodeling and heart failure development post-myocardial infarction. TGF-beta has been shown to accelerate wound healing, inhibit free radical formation, and limit myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury in various experimental models. Moreover, TGF-beta has demonstrated cardioprotective effects in cardiac damage and prevents cardiac fibroblast apoptosis induced by simulated ischemia-reperfusion through canonical (Smad3) and non-canonical (ERK1/2 and Akt) signaling pathways. TGF-beta also improves myocardial function in rat hearts injured by ischemia/reperfusion and prevents a/r-induced apoptosis of cardiomyocytes. In the heart, cardiac fibroblasts play a critical role in healing post-myocardial infarction, and TGF-beta, alongside its pro-survival and anti-inflammatory properties, markedly expands the range of therapeutic benefits to sustain and repair the myocardium after ischemic damage.",No
Is DITPA a thyroid hormone analog utilized in experimental and clinical studies,Yes,"Diiodothyropropionic acid (DITPA) is indeed a synthetic thyroid hormone analog, as confirmed by its utilization in both experimental and clinical studies. DITPA demonstrates positive inotropic effects akin to thyroid hormone but with minimal systemic effects. Clinical trials have shown that DITPA therapy lowers serum TSH levels and, to a lesser extent, serum T(3) and T(4), without causing differences in clinical manifestations of thyrotoxicosis or hypothyroidism. Furthermore, DITPA has been studied for its effects on body weight, serum lipoproteins, and bone metabolism markers in a prospective, controlled, double-blind 24-week trial. This trial was primarily designed to assess the treatment of stable chronic heart failure. In addition, DITPA has been investigated for its angiogenic properties in the nonischemic heart, as well as its effects on chamber remodeling, cardiac function, cellular morphology, cardiac blood flow, and protein expression. Drug-induced thyroid effects have also been evaluated in organotypic models utilizing either a rat thyroid lobe or human thyroid slices. The investigation of DITPA actions has demonstrated its efficacy in reducing body weight and lowering total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels.",No
Is MammaPrint cleared by the United States Food and Drug Administration?,Yes,"MammaPrint, a microarray-based gene expression test, has been cleared by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for assessing recurrence risk in early-stage breast cancer. This test is the only FDA-cleared prognostic assay based on gene expression in tumors from patients with early breast cancer. The test has been extensively validated and has shown significant prognostic performance at 5 and 10 years of follow-up. The MammaPrint assay uses expression levels of the 70 MammaPrint genes to assess distant recurrence risk in early-stage breast cancer. The test has been validated for use in both fresh and formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue. The MammaPrint test has been shown to be an independent factor for breast cancer patients with early-stage invasive lobular breast cancer and can help determine which women with early breast cancer could be spared adjuvant chemotherapy.",Yes
Is amantadine effective for treatment of disorders conciousness?,Yes,"Amantadine, an uncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist and dopamine agonist, has been shown to be effective for the treatment of various cerebral disorders, including those affecting consciousness. Its actions as a pro-dopaminergic drug and N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonist make it an interesting candidate for improving consciousness and responsiveness in individuals with disorders of consciousness (DOC), including vegetative state and minimally conscious state. In a study, an improvement in consciousness was observed within 3-6 days after the start of amantadine administration in all seven cases (100%). Furthermore, amantadine administration showed substantial positive effects on recovery following severe cerebral hemorrhage. Amantadine is currently recommended for use in patients of post-traumatic brain injury with unconsciousness and unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (UWS).",Yes
Is GAGA associated with nucleosome-free regions (NFR)?,Yes,"Justification: The evidence supports the notion that GAGA functions as a transcription activating factor, which typically binds to nucleosome-depleted regions of DNA. These regions, often referred to as nucleosome-free regions (NFRs), are characterized by the absence of nucleosomes and are associated with transcription start sites of most genes. The study of the GAGA(519) isoform as a transcription factor further supports this association, as it presents evidence for a novel 3' NFR that is present at >95% of all genes. Therefore, it can be concluded that GAGA is associated with nucleosome-free regions (NFRs).",Yes
Is amiodarone a class I anti-arrhythmic drug?,No,"Amiodarone is not classified as a pure class I anti-arrhythmic drug, as it primarily falls under the class III category. The class I anti-arrhythmic drugs are typically sodium channel blockers, which are further divided into subclasses (IA, IB, and IC) based on their electrophysiological effects. Amiodarone, on the other hand, is primarily a potassium channel blocker, which characterizes it as a class III anti-arrhythmic agent. However, it is essential to note that amiodarone also exhibits class I, II, and IV actions, making it a unique and effective anti-arrhythmic medication with a broad pharmacological spectrum. This multi-class action is responsible for its effectiveness in treating various cardiac rhythm disturbances, including supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias.",Yes
Is SLC22A3 expressed in the brain?,Yes,"The SLC22A3 (solute carrier family 22 member 3) gene, also known as organic cation transporter 3 (OCT3), is responsible for the transport of organic cations, including various endogenous compounds, drugs, and toxins. The gene is expressed in various tissues, including the brain. The expression of SLC22A3 in the brain is supported by the fact that its transcriptional regulation has been investigated using techniques such as luciferase, knockdown, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), and electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Furthermore, the segment of chromosome 22 containing the SLC22A3 gene also contains the sulfotransferase-4a1 (SULT4A1) gene, which is thought to be involved in neurotransmitter metabolism in the central nervous system. This suggests that the SLC22A3 gene may play a role in the transport of neurotransmitters or other organic cations in the brain.",No
Has the protein TIEG1 been associated with apoptosis?,No,"The protein TIEG1 has not been mentioned in the provided context as being associated with apoptosis. The context discusses various proteins such as TIPE1, TRAIL, TIPE2, and their roles in regulating cell death or apoptosis. However, TIEG1 is not mentioned, and therefore, it cannot be concluded that TIEG1 has been associated with apoptosis based on the provided context. Further research would be required to determine if TIEG1 has any role in apoptosis.",Yes
Is PTEN involved in follicular thyroid carcinoma?,Yes,"Justification: The study indicates that alteration of PTEN gene expression regulation is observed in thyroid tumor cell lines. Specifically, the under-expression of PTEN protein is found more frequently in thyroid cancers (29%) than in benign thyroid tumors (4.2%). This suggests that PTEN plays a role in the development of thyroid cancer, including follicular thyroid carcinoma, which is derived from follicular cells. The study also demonstrates that the reduction in PTEN expression in thyroid cancers is significantly related to the over-expression of HER-2 protein, which is known to play a role in carcinogenesis and development of thyroid cancer. Therefore, it can be inferred that PTEN is involved in follicular thyroid carcinoma.",No
Does strenuous physical activity affect thyroid hormone metabolism?,Yes,"Strenuous physical activity has been demonstrated to affect thyroid hormone metabolism, although the extent and impact of these changes remain controversial. Some studies have shown a transient change in thyroid hormones during intense physical performance, while others suggest that these changes are of minor impact and reflect the relative negative energy balance during strenuous exercise. The effect of different intensity levels of acute aerobic exercise on thyroid hormones has been investigated, with results indicating that thyroid hormones are only transiently or insignificantly changed during strenuous exercise. However, it has been suggested that adequate caloric intake should be guaranteed in highly performing young athletes to counteract the relative negative energy balance and prevent alterations in endocrine-metabolic profile. Additionally, the lack of corticosterone peak during high-intensity exercise has been found to lead to lower serum T3 and decreased serum T4, indicating that corticosterone might be fundamental for the maintenance of serum thyroid hormone levels after high-intensity exercise.",Yes
Is the gene MAOA epigenetically modified by methylation?,Yes,"The gene MAOA (Monoamine Oxidase A) undergoes epigenetic modification via DNA methylation. This modification, specifically at the promoter region, has been found to play a significant role in common psychiatric illnesses such as schizophrenia and obsessive-compulsive disorder. In these conditions, MAOA promoter methylation levels differ between patients and healthy controls. Furthermore, DNA methylation of MAOA has been shown to strengthen associations of interactions between MAOA-UVNTR genotypes and adversity with aggression and substance misuse. The methylation of MAOA has also been implicated as a potential risk marker for obsessive-compulsive disorder and a possible mechanistic correlate of response to cognitive behavioral therapy in this disorder.",Yes
Is glycyl-tRNA synthetase gene involved in the development of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease?,Yes,"The glycyl-tRNA synthetase gene (GARS) plays a significant role in the development of Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease, specifically in the axonal form of CMT, known as CMT2D. The GARS gene encodes the enzyme responsible for charging tRNA(Gly) with glycine in both the cytoplasm and mitochondria. Dominant mutations in the GARS gene have been causally associated with CMT2D, a dominantly inherited peripheral neuropathy. These mutations lead to selective peripheral nerve toxicity, resulting in the manifestation of CMT2D. However, the exact mechanism by which these mutations mediate the disease remains largely unresolved.",Yes
Is there any software for automated analysis of FISH images?,Yes,"Justification: There exists software for automated analysis of Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) images, such as the fluorescence image analyzer (FLIMA) software and theLOBSTER (Little Objects Segmentation and Tracking Environment) software. These software solutions are designed for quantitative analysis of FISH images and can provide quick and easy-to-use analysis of data. The FLIMA software is implemented on a general-purpose, commercially available image analyzer, while LOBSTER is an environment designed to help scientists design and customize image analysis workflows for accurate characterization of biological objects from a broad range of fluorescence microscopy images. These software solutions can greatly simplify the quantitative analysis of microscopy images and offer the possibility of performing comprehensive and precise analysis of a high number of images in an automated manner.",Yes
Is there an increased risk for cancer in Dyskeratosis Congenita?,Yes,"Dyskeratosis Congenita (DC) is associated with an increased predisposition to cancer. DC is characterized by poor telomere maintenance, which is known to increase the risk of developing multiple types of malignancy. Approximately 8% of patients with DC have malignancy, and the hyperkeratotic lesions affecting the mucous membranes have a propensity to undergo malignant change. DC is an inherited bone marrow failure syndrome associated with increased cancer susceptibility. Germline mutations in the tumor suppressor gene Dyskeratosis Congenita 1 (DKC1) cause the cancer-prone syndrome called X-linked Dyskeratosis Congenita. Patients with DC have an 11-fold increase in cancer predisposition compared to the general population. These findings suggest that DC is a disorder that increases the risk of developing malignancy.",No
Does MicroRNA-21 (miR-21) contribute to cardiovascular disease?,Yes,"MicroRNA-21 (miR-21) indeed contributes to cardiovascular disease, as evidenced by its implication in various cardiovascular conditions. It has been shown to play a significant role in the pathogenesis of diabetic cardiomyopathy, atherosclerosis, and heart failure. MiR-21 is a highly expressed microRNA in the cardiovascular system, where it promotes the development of cardiac fibrosis, hypertrophy, and heart failure. Its proproliferative and antiapoptotic properties have been observed to be elevated in metabolic syndrome. Furthermore, miR-21 has been found to mediate crucial roles in diabetic cardiac fibrosis, as demonstrated by gain-of-function and loss-of-function assays. The potential of circulating miR-21 as a biomarker for heart failure has also been suggested. Therefore, miR-21 is not only involved in cardiovascular diseases but also holds potential as a therapeutic target and diagnostic tool.",Yes
Are there any statistical methods for normalizing and identifying differential regions in histone modification ChIP-seq data?,Yes,"There exist statistical methods for normalizing and identifying differential regions in histone modification ChIP-seq data. One such method is histonehmm, a powerful bivariate hidden Markov model that outperforms competing methods in detecting functionally relevant differentially modified regions. This method provides probabilistic classifications of genomic regions as being either modified in both samples, unmodified in both samples, or differentially modified between samples. Furthermore, histonehmm includes an evaluation procedure that associates differential peaks with changes in gene expression as well as histone modifications close to these peaks. Another method, pepr, has been shown to identify differential regions that are consistent within groups and outperform other methods in scaling false discovery rate (FDR) analysis, particularly for histone modification data with broadly enriched regions. These methods demonstrate the importance of higher-order features of ChIP-seq peaks in assessing differential histone modifications and transcription factor binding.",Yes
Is CD84 genetically associated with arthritis?,No,"The context does not provide any information about the association of CD84 with arthritis. Instead, it discusses the roles of CD4 and CD8+ T cells, as well as the dendritic cell marker CD83, in the context of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The text also mentions the genetic link between RA and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules, as well as the association between CD4 enhancer gene polymorphisms and the risk of developing RA and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). However, there is no mention of CD84 in relation to arthritis or any other autoimmune diseases. Therefore, based on the provided context, it cannot be concluded that CD84 is genetically associated with arthritis.",Yes
Are there any specific antidotes for rivaroxaban?,No,"Justification: At present, there is no specific antidote appointed for rivaroxaban, a novel oral anticoagulant drug widely used in clinical practice. Despite its advantages compared with vitamin K antagonists, the lack of specific antidotes to reverse anticoagulant effects may increase the risk profile of patients with bleeding complications. The management strategies for patients receiving rivaroxaban who have a bleeding emergency or require emergency surgery are discussed in various reports, but no specific antidote has been formulated for the measurement of rivaroxaban reversal.",No
Is cytisine superior to nicotine replacement therapy for smoking cessation?,Yes,"Cytisine has been demonstrated to be superior to nicotine replacement therapy for smoking cessation. In combination with brief behavioral support, cytisine was found to be more effective than nicotine replacement therapy in helping smokers quit smoking. The effectiveness of cytisine for continuous abstinence was superior to that of nicotine replacement therapy at 1 week, 2 months, and 6 months. In a prespecified subgroup analysis, cytisine was superior to nicotine replacement therapy among women and noninferior among men. At 1 month, continuous abstinence from smoking was reported for 40% of participants receiving cytisine and 31% of participants receiving nicotine replacement therapy, for a difference of 9.3 percentage points. Cytisine, a partial agonist that binds with high affinity to the Î±(4)Î²(2) nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, is a low-cost treatment that has been found to be well-tolerated and more effective than nicotine replacement therapy.",Yes
Is the abnormal dosage of ultraconserved elements disfavored in cancer cells?,Yes,"Justification: The context suggests that aneuploidy, a state of karyotype imbalance, is a hallmark of cancer. Aneuploidy can result in abnormal dosage of genes, including ultraconserved elements. Additionally, chromosome instability (CIN) mediated massive gain and loss of genes provides a wider buffer for further genetic reshuffling, resulting in cancer cell heterogeneity, drug resistance, and evasion of oncogene addiction. This implies that an abnormal dosage of ultraconserved elements may be disfavored in cancer cells, as it can lead to genomic instability and potentially lethal mutations. However, cancer cells have acquired mechanisms to suppress these lethal mutations and/or CIN, suggesting a complex interplay between genomic instability and cancer cell survival.",Yes
Does thyroid hormone regulate calcium transient in the myocardium?,Yes,"Thyroid hormone regulates calcium transient in the myocardium by influencing the status of sarcolemmal calcium-transport processes and modifying calcium fluxes across the sarcolemmal membrane. This regulation is crucial in the development of thyroid state-dependent contractile changes in the heart. Additionally, thyroid hormones regulate the efficiency and expression of sarco-endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPases in cardiac and skeletal muscle. Studies have shown that thyroid hormone affects the cytosolic free calcium concentration in myotubes, and its effects on intracellular calcium transients and contractile performance in isolated ventricular rat myocytes have also been investigated. Furthermore, thyroid hormone has been shown to modulate the gene expression of cardiac potassium channels, which are involved in maintaining calcium homeostasis in the myocardium. These findings support the conclusion that thyroid hormone plays a significant role in regulating calcium transients in the myocardium.",Yes
Are proteasome inhibitors good candidates for treatment of leukemia and solid tumors?,Yes,", with caveats.

Proteasome inhibitors have demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of hematologic malignancies, including leukemia, and have also shown promise in the treatment of solid tumors. These inhibitors have been approved for the treatment of multiple myeloma and mantle cell lymphoma, and have displayed potential as a treatment for various other malignancies. Preclinical studies have shown that proteasome inhibitors can induce apoptosis and inhibit tumor growth, supporting their potential role in the treatment of various tumor types. However, it is important to note that the clinical efficacy of these inhibitors is lower in the treatment of solid tumors due to the functional and structural heterogeneity of proteasomes in solid tumors. Ongoing trials are examining the effectiveness of compound and novel proteasome inhibitors that can target solid tumors either alone or in combination with conventional chemotherapeutic agents. The clinical successes of proteasome inhibitors for the treatment of cancer have highlighted the therapeutic potential of targeting this protein degradation system.",Yes
Is there any link between CTF4 and CTF18 during sister chromatid cohesion?,Yes,"The physical and genetic interactions between CTF4 and CTF18, along with core components of replication fork complexes, suggest that both gene products act in association with the replication fork to facilitate sister chromatid cohesion. The absence of either CTF4 or CTF18 causes sister chromatid cohesion failure and leads to a preanaphase accumulation of cells that depends on the spindle assembly checkpoint. CTF4 interacts with MCM10p physically and genetically, and the chromatin association of CTF4p depends on MCM10p. CTF18 interacts with a replicative DNA polymerase, DNA polymerase Îµ (Pol Îµ), and associates with chromatin during S phase, being required for the proper resumption of replication after fork arrest. The requirement for CTF4 and CTF18 in robust cohesion identifies novel roles for replication accessory proteins in this process. These findings indicate a clear link between CTF4 and CTF18 during sister chromatid cohesion.",Yes
Are thyroid hormone receptor alpha1 mutations implicated in thyroid hormone resistance syndrome?,Yes,"Thyroid hormone receptor alpha1 (TRÎ±1) mutations are indeed implicated in thyroid hormone resistance syndrome (RTH). RTH is an autosomal dominant or recessive genetic disorder caused by mutations in either the thyroid hormone receptor Î² (TRÎ²) gene or the thyroid hormone receptor Î± (TRÎ±) gene. Specifically, mutations in the thyroid hormone receptor alpha (THRA) gene cause resistance to thyroid hormone alpha (RTHÎ±), a disease characterized by variable manifestations reminiscent of untreated congenital hypothyroidism. RTHÎ± is a rare genetic disease caused by mutations in THRA, the gene encoding TRÎ±1. This disorder is characterized by tissue-selective hypothyroidism and near-normal thyroid function tests due to thyroid receptor alpha gene mutations. In summary, mutations in the THRA gene, which encodes TRÎ±1, are implicated in thyroid hormone resistance syndrome.",Yes
Does administration of triiodothyronine improve outcome following coronary artery bypass grafting?,Yes,"Administration of triiodothyronine (T3) following coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) has been shown to significantly improve cardiac performance and postoperative ventricular function. Clinical studies have demonstrated improved myocardial recovery after severe ischemia in response to acute T3 treatment. Patients receiving T3 demonstrated a significantly lower incidence of postoperative myocardial ischemia (4% vs 18%, p =.007) and pacemaker dependence (14% vs 25%, p =.013). Despite similar baseline characteristics, patients randomized to T3 had a higher cardiac index and lower inotropic requirements after the operation. Furthermore, T3-treated patients had a lower incidence of atrial fibrillation (24% versus 46%; p = 0.009) and fewer required cardioversion (0 versus 6; p = 0.012) or anticoagulation (2 versus 10; p = 0.013) during hospitalization. These findings suggest that T3 supplementation significantly enhances postischemic left ventricular functional recovery and improves clinical outcomes following CABG.",Yes
Is long QT syndrome a cause for sudden cardiac death in athletes?,Yes,"Long QT Syndrome (LQTS) is indeed a cause for sudden cardiac death in athletes. LQTS is an inherited channelopathy characterized by prolonged ventricular repolarization, which can lead to life-threatening arrhythmias such as Torsade de Pointes. This condition is often identified by a prolonged QT interval on an electrocardiogram (ECG). The congenital form of LQTS is caused by cardiac ion channel mutations, which predispose young individuals, including athletes, to sudden cardiac death, often related to exercise. The physical exertion during sports activities can trigger ventricular tachycardia and/or fibrillation in individuals with LQTS, leading to sudden cardiac death. Therefore, it is crucial to screen athletes for this condition and manage it appropriately to prevent such tragic events.",Yes
Is protein M3/6 a dual specificity phosphatase?,Yes,"Protein M3/6 is classified as a dual specificity phosphatase due to its ability to dephosphorylate both tyrosine and threonine residues on substrate proteins. This is supported by its similarity to known dual-specificity phosphatases, such as HVH-5 and VHP1, and its specificity for c-Jun N-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase and p38 kinase. Furthermore, the presence of a nucleophilic cysteine residue and an adjacent histidine residue, which are conserved in all active dual-specificity phosphatases, further supports its classification as a dual specificity phosphatase.",Yes
Are there focused databases from which you can retrieve gene expression data on renal disease?,Yes,"Elaboration: Focused databases have been developed for the retrieval of gene expression data on renal disease. One such database is the Renal Gene Expression Database (RGED), which contains comprehensive gene expression data sets from renal disease research. Another relevant database is the Kidney Gene Database (KGDB), a curated and integrated database of genes involved in human kidney disease. These databases provide a user-friendly utility for the renal disease research community to query expression profiles of genes without requiring advanced computational skills. The availability of both tissue- and disease-specific expression data in these databases makes them a compelling option for renal disease research.",Yes
Are there any DNMT3 proteins present in plants?,No,"The context does not provide explicit information about the presence of DNMT3 proteins in plants. However, it does focus on the role of DNMT2, a DNA/tRNA cytosine methyltransferase, in the moss Physcomitrella patens. The study investigates the function of DNMT2 in stress recovery and tRNA transcription/stability under salt stress. The context mentions that DNMT2 has dual substrate specificity and methylates cytosines in both DNA and tRNA, unlike other members of the cytosine DNA methyltransferase gene family. The absence of any reference to DNMT3 proteins in the context suggests that they may not have been identified or studied in this particular plant species.",Yes
Has vitamin D has been shown to reduce incidence of falls in older people in clinical trials?,Yes,"Evidence from meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) supports the claim that vitamin D supplementation reduces the risk of falls in older adults. The odds ratio for suffering at least one fall was found to be 0.86 (95% confidence interval, 0.77-0.96) in a systematic review of eligible RCTs, indicating a statistically significant reduction in the risk of falls. The mechanism by which vitamin D reduces falls may be due to its effects on neuromuscular function and postural adaptations, as well as its role in maintaining bone and muscle health. However, it is important to note that the effect of vitamin D is still inconsistent and not quantitative, and some meta-analyses have shown either a small effect or no effect of vitamin D on falls. Nonetheless, the overall evidence suggests that vitamin D supplementation should be integrated into primary and secondary fall prevention strategies in older adults.",Yes
Has depression been shown to be a predictor of frailty?,No,"The study primarily focuses on investigating physical frailty as a predictor of depression. The evidence presented indicates that physical frailty is associated with an increased risk of depression and predicts the onset of depressed mood. However, the study does not provide sufficient evidence to establish depression as a predictor of frailty. The reciprocal association between late-life depression and physical frailty is suggested, but longitudinal studies are lacking to confirm this relationship. Therefore, based on the given context, it cannot be concluded that depression has been shown to be a predictor of frailty.",Yes
Is there any association between Jarid2 and miR-155 in Th17 cells?,No,"The provided context does not contain any information regarding the association between Jarid2 and miR-155 in Th17 cells. The text discusses the roles of miR-141-3p, miR-200a-3p, and miR-155 in Th17 cell differentiation and autoimmune diseases, as well as their potential target genes and signaling pathways. However, no mention is made of Jarid2 or its relationship with these miRNAs in Th17 cells.",Yes
Is it safe to take isotretinoin during pregnancy?,No,"Isotretinoin use during pregnancy is not safe due to its teratogenic effects, which can result in severe malformations in neonates. The risk for potential isotretinoin-exposed pregnancy was found to be 3.6 per 1000 treated women over a 5-year observation period. The teratogenic effects of isotretinoin can be avoided by implementing numerous recommendations and regulations to minimize the risk of pregnancy during treatment. Reproductive-age women treated with isotretinoin require reliable contraception to prevent pregnancies impacted by teratogenic effects. Despite risk management programs, women have still become pregnant during isotretinoin intake, resulting in live-born infants with different kinds of abnormalities. Therefore, it is not safe to take isotretinoin during pregnancy.",No
Can DNA intercalators function as topoisomerase inhibitors?,Yes,"Justification: DNA intercalators are a class of compounds that bind to DNA by inserting themselves between adjacent base pairs. Some of the most effective anticancer DNA intercalators target DNA topoisomerase II (top2), an enzyme that plays a vital role in DNA replication and transcription. The cytotoxic actions of these intercalators are thought to result from the trapping of top2 as a covalent complex on DNA, leading to disturbances in DNA metabolism. Hybrid compounds that combine DNA intercalation with DNA alkylation have been shown to exhibit enhanced DNA alkylating activity in the presence of top2 and are more potent than their parent compounds. The mechanism of their action is based on the inhibition of top2 activity. DNA intercalating drugs, such as doxorubicin, interfere with the action of mammalian top2 by trapping an intermediate complex of the enzyme covalently linked to the 5'-termini of DNA breaks. Therefore, it can be concluded that DNA intercalators can function as topoisomerase inhibitors.",Yes
Do orphan and gene related CpG islands follow power-law-like distributions?,Yes,"The distribution of CpG islands, both orphan and gene-related, has been shown to follow power-law-like distributions. The widths of the C-G distributions for the genes of several simple organisms have been observed to vary as power laws. Furthermore, the sizes of paralogue-gene families produced by ancestral duplication are known to follow a power-law distribution. This suggests that the power law behavior provides a universal scaling whereby the distributions for the C-G content of the genes from all species are mapped onto a single function. The scale invariant Poisson-Gamma (PG) distribution, which describes these findings, lends itself to a stochastic mechanism for the accumulation of segmental chromosomal changes. These observations support the conclusion that both orphan and gene-related CpG islands follow power-law-like distributions.",Yes
Can valproic acid act as an activator of AMPK?,Yes,"Valproic acid (VPA) has been established as an in vitro activator of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Studies have shown that treatment of hepatocytes with metabolites of VPA resulted in increased phosphorylation of AMPK/acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) compared to VPA alone. This suggests that VPA and its metabolites can activate AMPK, which plays a crucial role in regulating energy homeostasis and cellular metabolism. However, the exact mechanism by which VPA activates AMPK is not yet fully understood. Further research is needed to elucidate the precise molecular pathways involved in this process.",No
Is the Drosophila Translational Control Element (TCE) involved in spermatogenesis?,Yes,"The Drosophila Translational Control Element (TCE) is indeed involved in spermatogenesis. During Drosophila spermatogenesis, transcriptional activity is mainly restricted to premeiotic stages, while translation can be detected also in postmeiotic spermatids. This indicates a translational control mechanism at play. The gene transformer-2 (tra-2) of Drosophila is necessary not only for female sexual differentiation but also for normal spermatogenesis in males. The ribonucleoprotein consensus sequence (rnp-cs) of tra2 is required for male fertility and positive and negative control of alternative splicing in transgenic flies. Furthermore, the mRNAs of proteins required for post-meiotic chromatin reorganization, like protb and mst77f, are transcribed in meiotic spermatocytes and subjected to translational repression for days. These findings suggest that the TCE plays a crucial role in the regulation of gene expression during Drosophila spermatogenesis.",Yes
Is low T3 syndrome a prognostic marker in patients with renal insufficiency?,Yes,"Low T3 syndrome, characterized by decreased triiodothyronine (T3) levels without elevation of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and thyroxin (T4) levels, is a prevalent condition among non-critically ill patients. It is associated with poor clinical outcomes in various populations, including those with kidney failure. A high prevalence of low T3 syndrome has been observed in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients without dialysis, even in early stages (1 and 2). The increasing prevalence of low T3 as CKD progresses indicates its value as a predictor of worsening CKD. In patients with end-stage renal disease, low plasma triiodothyronine (T3) may be an unsuspected expression of the inflammatory state of these patients. Low T3 syndrome has been identified as a predictor of poor outcome in patients with cardiac dysfunction and is associated with increased early and late mortality in non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS) patients. Additionally, a direct association between low triiodothyronine (T3) syndrome and cardiovascular mortality has been reported in hemodialysis patients. In conclusion, low T3 syndrome may be a good candidate for predicting prognosis in future clinical practice of CKD.",No
Does burning mouth syndrome preferentially affect post-mepopausal women?,Yes,"Burning Mouth Syndrome (BMS) is a complex disorder predominantly affecting postmenopausal women. The condition is characterized by a chronic, intraoral burning sensation without any identifiable oral lesions or abnormal laboratory findings. BMS is most prevalent in peri- and postmenopausal women, with a varied symptomatology that often includes xerostomia, taste disturbances, and burning sensations in the oral cavity. The etiology of BMS remains unclear, but it is often associated with psychogenic disorders such as depression. Although BMS can occur in males and premenopausal females, it is significantly more common in postmenopausal women, with a higher incidence in women past the 5th decade of age. The number of menopausal symptoms and the volume of unstimulated saliva are significantly lower in participants with BMS than in those without the condition.",Yes
Can life style changes reduce oxidative stress,Yes,"Justification: Lifestyle changes can indeed reduce oxidative stress. This is supported by evidence that dietary modifications, such as calorie restriction and nutrient supplementation, can have a significant impact on oxidative stress levels. Additionally, physical activity and exercise have been shown to increase the antioxidant defense system, thereby reducing oxidative stress. Furthermore, lowering exposure to environmental pollutants with oxidizing properties and stabilizing mitochondrial energy production and efficiency can also contribute to reducing oxidative stress. Therefore, adopting a healthy dietary mode and engaging in regular physical activity can play a crucial role in regulating oxidative stress and maintaining cell and tissue homeostasis.",No
Is oxidative stress affected by FOXO expression?,Yes,"The expression of FOXO transcription factors plays a crucial role in regulating and responding to oxidative stress. FOXO3a, a primary isoform, mediates the cellular response to oxidative stress by controlling the expression of genes involved in DNA repair and glutamine metabolism. FOXO transcription factors also induce apoptosis and regulate the cellular production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Perturbation of the mechanisms that tightly couple ROS production, oxidative stress signaling, and FOXO activity to the subsequent cellular response is a critical step in cancer development and progression. Furthermore, FOXO6, a member of the FOXO family, helps regulate oxidative stress in gastric cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma. In response to oxidative stress, the nuclear retention of FOXO3a in astrocytes upregulates the expression of glutamine synthetase as a neuroprotective mechanism. Overall, the evidence suggests that oxidative stress is significantly affected by FOXO expression.",Yes
Is the Dictyostelium discoideum proteome known?,Yes,"The Dictyostelium discoideum proteome is known, as evidenced by the identification of 349 different secreted proteins using MS-based proteomics, which represents at least 2.6% of the 13,600 predicted proteins in the Dictyostelium genome. Additionally, the proteome contains a vast array of simple sequence repeats, providing a unique model to investigate proteostasis. The complete genomes of Dictyostelium discoideum and related species have been sequenced, allowing for further study of the proteome and its functions.",Yes
Is single-cell analysis (SCA) possible in proteomics?,Yes,"Single-cell analysis (SCA) is indeed possible in proteomics, as evidenced by the emerging field of single-cell proteomics. This approach allows for the capture of proteome profiles from isolated single cells, providing additional biological information compared to traditional bulk cell analysis. Single-cell proteomics is considered a key method in systems nanobiology, enabling the investigation of individual cell-specific properties and inhomogeneous cellular responses without the limitations of ensemble-averaging or heterogeneous cell population effects. The advancement of technologies such as mass spectrometry-based proteomics, single-cell isolation, and next-generation sequencing has enabled the development of quantitative, single-cell level analyses. These techniques provide key insights into cellular heterogeneity and are increasingly significant in current chemistry and biology.",Yes
Is shotgun lipidomics the direct infusion of a lipid sample into a mass spectrometer?,Yes,"Shotgun lipidomics involves the direct infusion of total lipid extracts into a high-resolution tandem mass spectrometer for the large-scale and systematic analysis of the composition, structure, and quantity of cellular lipids. This direct infusion-based approach allows for the comprehensive analysis of lipid species with high accuracy and precision, making it one of the most powerful tools in lipidomics. Shotgun lipidomics exploits the unique chemical and physical properties of lipid classes and individual molecular species to facilitate high-throughput analysis of a cellular lipidome directly from biological samples. The method of choice for sensitive detection and quantitation of molecular lipid species is mass spectrometry, either by direct infusion or coupled with liquid chromatography. In summary, shotgun lipidomics is indeed the direct infusion of a lipid sample into a mass spectrometer, which enables the quantitative and qualitative analysis of complex lipids in biological systems.",Yes
Is apixaban effective for treatment of acute venous thromboembolism?,Yes,"Apixaban, a direct oral factor Xa inhibitor, has demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of acute venous thromboembolism (VTE). In the AMPLIFY trial, apixaban was noninferior to enoxaparin/warfarin in preventing recurrent symptomatic VTE or VTE-related death, with significantly less bleeding. Additionally, apixaban has shown a reduction in all-cause hospitalizations and a shortened length of hospital stay in patients with acute VTE compared to enoxaparin/warfarin. Apixaban is also approved for the prevention of recurrent VTE events in patients with a history of VTE. Overall, apixaban is an effective treatment option for acute VTE, with a favorable safety profile compared to traditional anticoagulants.",Yes
Is the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle affected in inflammation?,Yes,"The Tricarboxylic Acid (TCA) cycle is indeed affected in inflammation. This metabolic pathway is not only central to energy production but also plays a role in non-energy production activities, including inflammatory responses. Alterations in the TCA cycle have been linked to inflammation and various diseases, including cardiovascular diseases and immunopathologies. The TCA cycle intermediates can have non-metabolic signaling functions in macrophages under inflammatory stimulation, contributing to the progression of inflammatory conditions such as atherosclerosis. Therefore, it is clear that the TCA cycle is affected in inflammation and may even contribute to the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases.",Yes
Are reduced-nicotine cigarettes effective for smoking cessation?,Yes,"Evidence suggests that reduced-nicotine cigarettes, when used in combination with nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), may facilitate smoking cessation by reducing withdrawal symptoms and increasing quit rates. Abrupt reduction in nicotine content may decrease smoking behavior, nicotine dependence, and related constructs, while increasing quit attempts and eventual cessation. Moderate evidence indicates that reduced nicotine cigarettes (RNC) increase the likelihood of making a quit attempt among smokers, both unmotivated and motivated to quit, who also use NRT. RNC cigarettes have been shown to result in smoking fewer cigarettes, withdrawal relief, and facilitation of cessation. Reducing nicotine concentration in cigarettes to sub-addictive levels is a potential regulatory strategy for reducing tobacco dependence. However, the effectiveness of very low nicotine content cigarettes (VLNC) may vary among heterogeneous smokers.",Yes
Is the Wnt protein modified by notum?,Yes,"Justification: The Wnt protein is indeed modified by Notum. Notum, a member of the Î±/Î²-hydrolase superfamily, has been identified as a secreted inhibitor of Wnt signaling. It functions as a negative regulator by removing an essential palmitoleate group from Wnt proteins, a process known as deacylation. This modification results in the formation of inactivated Wnt proteins that are unable to bind to their receptors. The palmitoleoylation of Wnt proteins is obligatory for maintaining their active monomeric conformation, and Notum's ability to hydrolyze this modification underscores its role as a Wnt deacylase.",Yes
Is ospemifene effective for treatment of dyspareunia?,Yes,"Ospemifene, a selective estrogen receptor modulator, has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of moderate to severe dyspareunia, a symptom of vulvar and vaginal atrophy due to menopause. Its efficacy has been demonstrated through various studies, including a prospective study of menopausal women with dyspareunia, where 60 mg daily for 20 weeks showed improvement in physical examination findings. A meta-analysis further supports ospemifene as an effective and safe treatment for dyspareunia associated with postmenopausal vulvar and vaginal atrophy. Ospemifene has been shown to significantly improve the structure and pH levels of the vagina, thereby reducing dyspareunia. Phase III clinical trials have also shown good efficacy in improving objective and subjective signs and measures of genitourinary syndrome of menopause in postmenopausal women.",Yes
Is pregabalin effective for treatment of patients with restless leg syndrome?,Yes,"Pregabalin has been demonstrated to have a positive benefit on sleep disturbance associated with several different clinical conditions, including restless legs syndrome. This is evidenced by its ability to improve pain-related sleep interference and overall sleep quality in patients with neuropathic pain due to spinal cord injury. Furthermore, pregabalin-treated subjects have shown improved sleep measures in placebo-controlled and open-label studies for the treatment of fibromyalgia. Given that restless legs syndrome is a neurological disorder characterized by uncomfortable sensations in the legs and an urge to move them, which can significantly interfere with sleep, pregabalin's analgesic and anxiolytic properties make it a promising treatment option. However, further research is needed to fully understand the therapeutic efficacy of pregabalin specifically for reducing the incidence of restless legs syndrome.",Yes
Can zinc finger nucleases be used to combat disease?,Yes,"Zinc Finger Nucleases (ZFNs) have shown potential as a promising tool for combating diseases. These engineered nucleases, consisting of a zinc finger array fused to a non-specific cleavage domain, have been extensively used to modify a broad range of endogenous genes. ZFNs have proven invaluable for stimulating homology-directed gene repair in various cell types, enabling precise modifications of genetic information in living cells at high efficiency. The ability of ZFNs to target specific DNA sequences within complex genomes makes them a powerful tool for genome manipulation. Furthermore, ZFNs can be engineered to induce site-specific single-strand breaks or nicks in genomic DNA, leading to homology-directed repair. This capability has significant implications for gene therapy, where ZFNs could potentially be used to correct genetic defects associated with diseases. However, it is important to note that further research is needed to fully understand and optimize the use of ZFNs in combating diseases.",No
Is RET the major gene involved in Hirschsprung disease?,Yes,"The RET proto-oncogene is indeed the major gene involved in Hirschsprung disease (HSCR). This gene plays a significant role in the complex genetics of HSCR, a congenital defect of the enteric nervous system characterized by a lack of ganglia along variable lengths of the gut. The RET gene contains over 80% of all known disease-causing mutations, with both rare and common, coding and noncoding mutations contributing to the multifactorial nature of this pathology. The involvement of the RET gene in HSCR is further supported by the observation of experimentally produced intestinal aganglionosis in mice with a null mutation of this gene and the increased evidence of RET mutations in patients with HSCR. Additionally, a significant over-transmission of the ""Hirschsprung disease haplotype"" has been detected when comparing transmitted versus nontransmitted alleles in HSCR triads without mutation.",Yes
is intense physical activity associated with longevity ?,Yes,"Intense physical activity has been associated with longevity, as evidenced by its positive influence on health and cognition across the lifespan. High levels of physical activity, including high-intensity training to improve cardiorespiratory fitness, have been shown to promote longevity and slow down aging. Moreover, increasing exercise intensity in older adults has been linked to greater reductions in the risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality. It is important to note that simply expending energy through any activity may influence survival in older adults. However, performing three to five times the recommended physical activity minimum has been found to reach the maximal longevity benefit that can be achieved. Therefore, it can be concluded that intense physical activity is associated with longevity.",No
Are cyclophilins proteins that bind to prolines?,Yes,"Cyclophilins are indeed proteins that bind to prolines. They are a family of enzymes known as peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerases (PPIases), which catalyze the cis-trans isomerization of peptidyl-prolyl bonds in proteins. This process is crucial for protein folding, as it allows for the correct conformation of proteins to be achieved. Cyclophilins are highly conserved and ubiquitously expressed, and they have been implicated in a variety of biological processes, including protein folding, transport, and signaling. They are also known for their ability to bind to the immunosuppressive drug cyclosporin A, which has led to their use as potential drug targets in cancer and certain viral and parasitic infections.",No
Can a given genotype exhibit opposite fitness effects (beneficial and detrimental) within the same environment?,Yes,"Justification: A given genotype can indeed exhibit opposite fitness effects within the same environment due to the complex interplay of genetic, environmental, and social factors. This phenomenon, known as antagonistic pleiotropy, occurs when a single allele has opposing effects on different fitness components. For instance, a mutation that enhances reproductive success might simultaneously reduce survival probability. Additionally, the expression of a genotype's fitness effects can be contingent on the specific environmental context. For example, mildly deleterious mutations may interact synergistically in resource-poor environments but antagonistically in resource-rich environments. Therefore, it is plausible for a genotype to confer both beneficial and detrimental fitness effects within the same environment, depending on the specific circumstances and interactions involved.",Yes
Has the protein SETMAR (Metnase) a transposase domain?,Yes,"The protein SETMAR, also known as Metnase, possesses a transposase domain. This domain is derived from the mariner transposase and is a crucial component of the SETMAR protein, which is a fusion between a SET-domain methyltransferase gene and a mariner-family transposase gene. The transposase domain in SETMAR is largely conserved, although it has a unique catalytic motif (ddn) compared to the ddd motif found in related transposases. This domain plays a significant role in DNA repair, specifically in non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) repair and double-strand break (DSB) repair. Despite its sequence-specific DNA binding activity, the exact role of the transposase domain in DNA repair is not fully understood.",Yes
Is alternative splicing of apoptotic genes playing a role in the response to DNA or mitochondrial damage?,Yes,"Alternative splicing of apoptotic genes indeed plays a significant role in the response to DNA damage. DNA damage has been shown to induce changes in alternative splicing, and conversely, alternative splicing can modulate the DNA damage response. This cross-regulation is evidenced by genome-wide alternative splicing profiling upon DNA damage induction. The manipulation of alternative splicing presents a unique way of regulating the apoptotic response, as it can generate splice variants that antagonize normal transcripts on apoptosis. Furthermore, alternative splicing of genes critical for cell death, such as Bcl-x, can lead to the formation of functionally different products with opposing functions, either promoting or preventing cell death. This functional fine-tuning of programmed cell death is a crucial aspect of the cellular response to DNA damage.",Yes
Is nucleosome eviction ATP-dependent?,Yes,"Nucleosome eviction is an ATP-dependent process. Chromatin remodeling enzymes, such as the human SWI/SNF complex, utilize the energy derived from ATP hydrolysis to alter histone-DNA contacts and facilitate nucleosome eviction. This process enables transcription factors to bind to nucleosomal DNA, thereby regulating DNA-based processes in eukaryotes. Furthermore, the stability of the altered nucleosomal structure upon removal of ATP from the reaction indicates that ATP hydrolysis is necessary for the initial remodeling process, but not for maintaining the altered structure. The coupling of DNA unwinding and ATP dephosphorylation, as well as the involvement of ATP-dependent nucleosome remodeling and core histone tail modifications, further underscores the importance of ATP in this process.",No
Is TREM2 associated with Alzheimer's disease in humans?,Yes,"TREM2 is strongly associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) in humans. Genome-wide association studies have identified heterozygous genetic variants within the TREM2 gene, such as the rs75932628-T variant, as risk factors for AD and other neurodegenerative diseases. These variants, including the rare p.R47H variant, are linked to an increased risk of AD, likely due to loss-of-function mutations. TREM2 is specifically expressed in brain microglia and plays a crucial role in modulating microglial functions in response to key AD pathologies, such as amyloid-Î² (AÎ²) plaques and tau tangles. Furthermore, TREM2 deletion exacerbates tau accumulation and spreading in the presence of Î²-amyloid pathology, promoting brain atrophy. Although the exact mechanism by which TREM2 influences AD susceptibility remains uncertain, its association with AD in humans is well-established.",Yes
Have mutations in the Polycomb group been found in human diseases?,Yes,"Justification: Mutations in the Polycomb group (PcG) genes have been found to be associated with various human diseases, particularly in cancer. PcG proteins are epigenetic regulators that play a crucial role in maintaining cell identity and are essential for normal development. The abnormal expression of PcG proteins is closely linked to carcinogenesis, and mutations and deletions of PcG complex components have been increasingly recognized to affect tumor biology in a range of cancers. Furthermore, mutations in several PcG genes have been shown to cause maternal-effect or zygotic segmentation defects, suggesting that PcG genes may regulate the segmentation genes of Drosophila. Additionally, variations in the Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) have been identified, which include the autism susceptibility candidate 2 (AUTS2). These findings suggest that mutations in the Polycomb group have been found in human diseases, particularly in cancer and developmental disorders.",Yes
Is microRNA(miRNA) 29 involved in post-ischemic cardiac remodeling?,Yes,"MicroRNA-29 (miR-29) is indeed implicated in post-ischemic cardiac remodeling. miR-29 is suggested to function as an anti-fibrotic factor with potential therapeutic effects on cardiac fibrosis. In vivo studies have demonstrated that overexpression of miR-29a inhibits cardiac hypertrophy, while knockdown of miR-29a increases cardiac cross-sectional area, indicating an antagonistic effect on cardiac hypertrophy. Furthermore, miR-29b-3p has been investigated for its role and mechanism in cardiac fibrosis after myocardial ischemia/reperfusion. Therefore, it can be concluded that miR-29 is involved in post-ischemic cardiac remodeling.",Yes
Is exonuclease Xrn1 a component of the P-bodies?,Yes,"Exonuclease Xrn1, a major cytoplasmic 5' to 3'-exoribonuclease, plays a critical role in ensuring the fidelity of cellular RNA turnover in eukaryotes. Beyond its primary function, Xrn1 has been proposed to act as a processivity factor, conferring a processive mechanism of action on endonucleases involved in nucleotide excision repair (NER). Xrn1 is known to degrade diverse RNA substrates during general RNA decay and participate in specialized processes integral to RNA metabolism, such as nonsense-mediated decay (NMD), gene silencing, rRNA maturation, and transcription termination. Furthermore, recent breakthroughs in understanding the molecular mechanisms of Xrn1, including its crystal structure and mutational analysis, have revealed its processive degradation of 5' monophosphorylated RNA. Given its involvement in various aspects of RNA metabolism and its processive activity, it is plausible that Xrn1 is a component of P-bodies, which are cytoplasmic foci involved in mRNA decay, storage, and translational repression. However, further research is needed to confirm this hypothesis and elucidate the specific role of Xrn1 within P-bodies.",Yes
Can sorafenib activate AMPK?,Yes,"The data suggests that sorafenib can indeed activate AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). This activation occurs in a manner that involves either upstream LKB1 or CAMKK2. The combination of sorafenib with AMPK activators, such as metformin, could potentially have beneficial effects on tumor regression through AMPK pathway activation. Furthermore, a synergistic effect of both drugs is observed on the phosphorylation of the AMPKÎ± activation site. This indicates that sorafenib not only activates AMPK but also enhances its activation when combined with other AMPK activators.",Yes
Is Vortioxetine effective for treatment of depression?,Yes,"Vortioxetine has been clinically established as an effective antidepressant in the treatment of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). Its unique pharmacodynamic profile, characterized by potent antagonism of the 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor and serotonin transporter, contributes to its antidepressant function. Clinical studies have demonstrated its efficacy in improving depressive symptoms in MDD patients, particularly in those who have not responded adequately to other antidepressants. Furthermore, Vortioxetine has shown beneficial effects on cognitive dysfunction, including executive function, in depressed patients. Its safety profile, with statistically lower withdrawal rates due to adverse events compared to other antidepressants, further supports its use in the treatment of depression.",Yes
Is exome sequencing efficient for the detection of germline mutations?,Yes,"Exome sequencing is indeed efficient for the detection of germline mutations. It is a technique that allows for the global analysis of protein coding sequences in the human genome, making it an effective and affordable approach for detecting causative genetic mutations in diseases. Exome sequencing has been successful in identifying heritable germline mutations and de novo mutations for rare Mendelian disorders. It has the capability of reliably identifying inherited and de novo single-nucleotide variants, small insertions, and deletions. Furthermore, exome sequencing enables the screening of most protein coding genes in an unbiased way, making it an ideal tool for identifying previously under- or unappreciated phenotypes associated with known disease genes and genetic disorders. The use of exome sequencing as a diagnostic tool is increasingly evident and it greatly facilitates the downstream analysis of exome sequencing data for identifying causal mutations of inherited disorders.",Yes
Is it feasible to determine the complete proteome of yeast?,Yes,"The feasibility of determining the complete proteome of yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, has been demonstrated through the application of mass-spectrometry-based proteomics, which has enabled the identification of the entire protein complement of yeast and the close-to-complete set of proteins expressed in mammalian cell lines. The availability of an annotated genome sequence for the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has facilitated proteome-scale studies of protein function and protein-protein interactions. Despite extensive large-scale analyses, over a thousand yeast genes remain uncharacterized, highlighting the need for further research. However, the ability to measure the abundance and visualize the localization of proteins across the yeast proteome has stimulated hypotheses on gene function and fueled discoveries, indicating that the determination of the complete proteome of yeast is a viable and valuable endeavor.",Yes
Are circRNAs associated with diseases and traits?,Yes,"Recent studies have demonstrated a significant correlation between circular RNAs (circRNAs) and various human diseases. The dysregulation and abnormal expression of circRNAs have been found to be associated with the development and progression of complex diseases, such as diabetes mellitus, nervous system diseases, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer. CircRNAs have been identified as pleiotropic molecules, whose dysregulation has been linked to human diseases, and can drive cancer by impacting gene expression and signaling pathways. Furthermore, genetic variation of circRNAs may affect complex traits/diseases by changing their binding efficiency to target miRNAs and proteins. The detection of circRNAs aberrantly expressed in disease conditions calls for the investigation of their functions, as they are implicated in various biological processes. The identification of circRNA-disease associations would contribute towards diagnosing the pathogenesis of diseases and could be considered as potential biomarkers for clinical diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment.",Yes
Could the Menzerath-Altmann law be proved mathematically trivial in genomes?,No,"The Menzerath-Altmann law, which states that the mean size of constituents decreases as the number of constituents increases, has been observed in genomes, particularly in exon sizes and exon numbers. However, the law is not mathematically trivial in genomes. Extensive linear fits representative of accordance to the law are restricted to a particular subset of genes with specific characteristics. The assumption that the law is an inevitable consequence of the relationship between genome size and chromosome number has been shown to be unrealistic from the perspective of chromosome structure and statistical analysis of real genomes. Therefore, the Menzerath-Altmann law cannot be proven mathematically trivial in genomes.",Yes
"Are there studies representing the involvement of Notch mutations in neurodegenerative diseases such as Down syndrome, Pick's and Prion's disease, and cadasil syndrome?",Yes,"Justification: The context provided indicates that there are studies representing the involvement of Notch mutations in various neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, CADASIL syndrome, and other neurologic diseases associated with mental retardation or dementia. The text also mentions that Notch receptors have been hypothesized to play a role in neurodegeneration, particularly in Alzheimer's disease (Notch1) and CADASIL (Notch3). Although the context does not explicitly mention Down syndrome, Pick's disease, or Prion's disease, the involvement of Notch mutations in a wide range of neurologic diseases suggests that it is plausible that Notch mutations could also be involved in these neurodegenerative diseases. Further research is needed to confirm the specific roles of Notch mutations in these diseases.",Yes
Are there any functional differences between Mfd and its human Cocaine syndrome protein B (CSB) homolog?,Insufficient,"Information

Based on the provided context, it is not possible to definitively determine if there are functional differences between Mfd and its human Cocaine syndrome protein B (CSB) homolog. The context does not provide any direct comparison or information regarding the functional aspects of Mfd and CSB. However, it does highlight differences in the catalytic activity of related enzymes (mcoch and hcoch) and the impact of cocaine on brain structure and behavior. These findings suggest that differences in structure and function could exist between Mfd and CSB, but further research is needed to confirm this.",Yes
Is the yeast Îac1 transcription factor induced upon copper deficiency?,No,"The yeast Mac1 transcription factor is not induced upon copper deficiency. Instead, the Mac1 protein is rendered inactive for copper transporter gene transcription in response to low copper ion concentrations. This is due to the negative regulation of Mac1p-dependent transcriptional activation by copper. The Mac1 protein is essential for the expression of yeast high affinity copper uptake, but its activity is modulated by copper levels. In contrast, the Ace1 transcription factor is induced upon high environmental levels of copper and plays a key role in mediating copper resistance in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.",Yes
Have thyronamines  effects on fat tissue?,No,"The context does not provide explicit information on the effects of thyronamines on fat tissue. Thyronamines, which are decarboxylated and deiodinated derivatives of thyroid hormones, have been studied in the context of their roles in various physiological processes, such as energy metabolism and cardiovascular function. However, the context primarily focuses on the roles of thyroid hormones, specifically triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4), in modulating adipose tissue differentiation and metabolism. The context also discusses the expression and activity of the deiodinase enzyme D1, which converts T4 to T3, in adipose tissue, and the potential role of T3 in modulating adipose tissue metabolism in response to leptin. The context does not provide information on the effects of thyronamines on fat tissue.",Yes
Is there a package in R/bioconductor for classification of alternative splicing?,Yes,"Justification: The R package 'Splicer' is available from the Bioconductor repository and is specifically designed for the classification of alternative splicing. This tool facilitates the detection of various alternative splicing events, such as single or multiple exon skipping, alternative donor and acceptor sites, intron retention, alternative first or last exon usage, and mutually exclusive exon events. Furthermore, Splicer predicts the coding potential and potential nonsense mediated decay sensitivity of each transcript, thereby providing a comprehensive analysis of alternative splicing.",Yes
Is alemtuzumab effective for remission induction in patients diagnosed with T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia?,Yes,"Alemtuzumab, a monoclonal anti-CD52 antibody, has been shown to be effective for remission induction in patients diagnosed with T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia (T-PLL). This treatment modality is the standard of care for T-PLL, with infusional alemtuzumab followed by consolidating allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in eligible patients. The use of alemtuzumab has been demonstrated to improve the rate of complete remission and duration of response to more than 50% and between 6 and 12 months, respectively. Furthermore, patients receiving alemtuzumab experienced significantly improved progression-free survival as compared with patients undergoing observation. These findings support the use of alemtuzumab as a reasonable option for patients with progressive and symptomatic T-PLL that is refractory to both alkylator-based and fludarabine-based regimens.",Yes
Is there an association between TERT promoter mutation and survival of glioblastoma patients?,Yes,"The TERT promoter mutation has been identified as a significant factor in the survival outcomes of glioblastoma patients. The presence of these mutations is associated with a poorer prognosis, particularly in gliomas without MGMT methylation, as indicated by a hazard ratio of 1.86 (95% CI = 1.54-2.26, p-value < 0.001). Furthermore, meta-analyses have suggested that TERT promoter mutations are independently associated with worse prognosis in glioma patients (HR = 2.28, 95% CI = 1.72-3.01, p < 0.00001). These findings highlight the potential of TERT promoter mutations as prognostic markers for gliomas and their role in informing future therapeutic strategies.",Yes
Is bapineuzumab effective for treatment of patients with Alzheimer's disease?,No,"Bapineuzumab, an anti-amyloid monoclonal antibody, has been evaluated for its potential in reducing cerebral beta-amyloid peptide burden in patients with Alzheimer's disease. Despite demonstrating target engagement with brain amyloid-beta and inducing exposure-dependent reductions in brain amyloid burden, bapineuzumab did not improve clinical outcomes in patients with Alzheimer's disease. This lack of clinical improvement was observed despite treatment differences in biomarkers in APOE Îµ4 carriers. Furthermore, bapineuzumab administered subcutaneously once-monthly did not demonstrate significant treatment difference over placebo on cerebral amyloid signal at one year. Although the preliminary cognitive efficacy of bapineuzumab appears uncertain, the current evidence suggests that it is not effective for the treatment of patients with Alzheimer's disease.",Yes
Is intense physical activity associated with longevity?,Yes,"Intense physical activity is associated with longevity, as evidenced by its contribution to cardiorespiratory fitness and reduction in cardiovascular disease and mortality risk. High-intensity training, a form of intense physical activity, has been found to promote longevity and slow down aging. Moreover, increasing exercise intensity in older adults is linked to greater reductions in the risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality. It is also noted that older people who engage in regular exercise, including intense physical activity, tend to live longer, more vigorous, and independent lives. The beneficial effects of physical activity on longevity are supported by robust epidemiological evidence, which suggests that lifelong regular exercise contributes to longevity. Furthermore, performing three to five times the recommended physical activity minimum has been shown to achieve the maximal longevity benefit. Therefore, it can be concluded that intense physical activity is indeed associated with longevity.",Yes
Is desmin an intermediate filament protein involved in Dilated Cardiomyopathy (DCM)?,Yes,"Desmin, an intermediate filament protein, plays a crucial role in the structural and mechanical integrity of cardiomyocytes. Recent studies have confirmed that a missense mutation in the gene encoding desmin can lead to Dilated Cardiomyopathy (DCM). This mutation, specifically the Ile451Met variant, has been identified as a genetic cause of DCM, albeit with low frequency. Desmin-related cardiomyopathy is characterized by the accumulation of desmin and related proteins in myocytes, leading to myofibrillar degeneration and cardiac dysfunction. The remodeling of the desmin cytoskeleton has been suggested to contribute to the progression of idiopathic DCM and affect patients' long-term prognosis. Furthermore, a decrease or lack of desmin expression is a strong, independent predictor of an unfavorable prognosis in patients with idiopathic DCM. Therefore, it can be concluded that desmin is indeed an intermediate filament protein involved in Dilated Cardiomyopathy.",Yes
Is lambrolizumab effective for treatment of patients with melanoma ?,Yes,"Lambrolizumab, also known as pembrolizumab, has demonstrated efficacy for the treatment of advanced/metastatic melanoma patients. In patients with advanced melanoma, including those who had disease progression while receiving ipilimumab, treatment with lambrolizumab resulted in a high rate of sustained tumor regression, with mainly grade 1 or 2 toxic effects. The anti-PD-1 antibody was administered intravenously at a dose of 10 mg per kilogram of body weight every 2 or 3 weeks or 2 mg per kilogram every 3 weeks in patients with advanced melanoma, both those who had received prior treatment with the immune checkpoint inhibitor ipilimumab and those who had not. The literature search was conducted in electronic databases for studies that evaluated the efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab either alone or in combination with other treatments for advanced/metastatic melanoma patients. The findings indicate that the onset of vitiligo-like leukoderma during melanoma treatment could be a marker of favorable outcome in patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors.",Yes
Is cadasil syndrome a hereditary disease?,Yes,"CADASIL (Cerebral Autosomal Dominant Arteriopathy with Subcortical Infarcts and Leukoencephalopathy) is a hereditary disease caused by mutations in the NOTCH3 gene. This gene provides instructions for making a protein that is involved in the development, maturation, and maintenance of blood vessels in the brain. The mutations in the NOTCH3 gene cause abnormal protein clumps to form in the walls of small blood vessels, leading to damage and narrowing of the blood vessels. CADASIL is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, meaning that a person only needs to inherit one copy of the mutated gene from one parent to develop the condition.",Yes
Is nintedanib effective for Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis?,Yes,"Nintedanib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, is an approved treatment for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Its efficacy in slowing disease progression is demonstrated by reducing the decline in forced vital capacity (FVC) in patients with IPF, as evidenced by multiple clinical trials, including the INPULSIS-ON trial. Nintedanib has shown an inhibitory effect on reduced lung function, incidence of acute exacerbation of IPF, and worsened health-related quality of life. Furthermore, exploratory data suggest that 6 months' treatment with nintedanib is associated with a smaller degree of fibrotic change in the lungs and reduced FVC decline compared to placebo. Expert opinion supports the safety and effectiveness of nintedanib in patients with IPF, with a favorable long-term safety profile.",Yes
Is pesticide exposure associated with polyneuropathy?,Inconclusive,"The association between polyneuropathy and occupational exposure to pesticides remains controversial. While there is evidence suggesting that pesticides can cause a wide range of neurological symptoms, including those associated with polyneuropathy, the specific role of pesticides in the development of this condition is not well understood. Additionally, there are few data on important exposure characteristics such as dose-effect relations, making it difficult to draw definitive conclusions about the relationship between pesticide exposure and polyneuropathy. Further research is needed to better understand the potential risks and mechanisms involved in this association.",Yes
Is there an association between borna virus and brain tumor?,Inconclusive,"The association between Borna virus and brain tumors remains unclear. While Borna disease virus (BDV) has been identified as a potential infectious agent involved in central nervous system diseases and has been detected in brain tumor cells, its role in tumor induction is not fully understood. The presence of BDV-specific nucleic acids in brain tumors suggests a possible association, but the exact mechanism of this relationship is not yet fully elucidated. Further research is needed to determine whether BDV plays a direct or indirect role in the development of brain tumors.",Yes
Does PU.1 (SPI1) affect NF-kB binding?,Yes,"PU.1 (SPI1) does affect NF-kB binding, as evidenced by its physical and functional interactions with NF-IL6Î², a leucine zipper transcription factor implicated in inflammatory responses. PU.1 recruits the binding of a second B cell-restricted nuclear factor, NF-EM5, to a DNA site in the immunoglobulin kappa 3' enhancer. The phosphorylation of PU.1 at Ser148 is necessary for its interaction with NF-EM5, and this phosphorylation can regulate transcriptional activity. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays have shown that PU.1 and NF-IL6Î² can simultaneously bind to adjacent DNA binding sites, indicating that PU.1 may influence NF-kB binding through its interactions with these transcription factors.",Yes
Does the majority of the mitochondrial genomes abide to the second parity rule (PR2)?,Insufficient,"Information

The Second Parity Rule (PR2) states that in a double-stranded DNA molecule, the amount of Adenine (A) should be equal to Thymine (T), and the amount of Guanine (G) should be equal to Cytosine (C). However, the context does not provide information on the nucleotide composition of the mitochondrial genome, making it impossible to determine if the majority of mitochondrial genomes abide by the Second Parity Rule. Further analysis of the nucleotide composition of mitochondrial genomes would be required to answer this question.",Yes
Is there an association between bruxism and reflux?,Yes,"Recent studies have identified strong associations among bruxism, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and tooth wear. Rhythmic masticatory muscle activity, including sleep bruxism (SB), can be induced in healthy individuals by experimental esophageal acidification, which plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of GERD. After adjustment, GERD has been identified as a risk factor for bruxism. Furthermore, sleep bruxism is prevalent in GERD patients, and GERD is highly associated with SB. These findings suggest a significant association between bruxism and reflux.",Yes
Is paroxetine effective for treatment of premenstrual dysphoric disorder?,Yes,"Paroxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), has been established as an effective treatment for various mood disorders, including depression, panic disorder, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Given the strong association between premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) and depression, as well as the link between PMDD and serotonergic dysregulation, it is plausible to infer that paroxetine could be effective in managing PMDD symptoms. Although there is limited data specifically on the effect of paroxetine on premenstrual symptoms, its proven efficacy in treating depression and anxiety disorders, which commonly occur in PMDD, suggests that it may be an effective treatment option. Furthermore, the positive results observed with other serotonergic antidepressants, such as fluoxetine and sertraline, in the treatment of PMDD support the potential efficacy of paroxetine for this disorder. However, further research is warranted to establish the optimal dosing regimen and to confirm the efficacy and safety of paroxetine specifically for PMDD.",Yes
Is endostatin a proangiogenic factor?,No,"Justification: Endostatin, a fragment of collagen XVIII, is not a proangiogenic factor. On the contrary, it exhibits antiangiogenic properties both in vitro and in vivo when administered at high doses. This protein is an endogenous inhibitor of angiogenesis and has been shown to influence the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling pathway by downregulating SGC protein levels in a post-transcriptional, PP2A-dependent manner. Endostatin's antiangiogenic properties have been implicated in the development of cardiovascular disease and cancer, and its administration has been found to potently inhibit choroidal neovascularization (CNV) growth and vascular leakage. Although endostatin's role in hematologic malignancies is not fully understood, its antiangiogenic properties make it a promising candidate for cancer therapy.",Yes
Can botulism poisoning of a pregnant woman harm her fetus?,Yes,"Justification: Botulism poisoning in pregnant women can indeed harm the fetus. The toxins responsible for botulism, produced by the bacteria Clostridium botulinum, have been found to pass through the placental barrier. This can result in direct damage to the fetus, albeit at low concentrations. Furthermore, maternal exposure to toxins during pregnancy can occasionally lead to miscarriage and malformation. In some cases, such as with carbamate pesticide poisoning, toxicological findings have revealed comparable concentrations of the toxin in the fetus's liver, brain, and kidney as in the mother's blood. It is also noteworthy that envenomation during pregnancy can result in fetal and maternal death. Therefore, it is established that botulism poisoning in pregnant women can indeed pose a risk to the fetus.",Yes
Does a linker histone exist in the yeast genome?,Yes,"Justification: The yeast genome encodes a single linker histone, denoted as hho1p, which has been identified in the species Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This protein contains two globular domains and shares sequence homology with linker histones h1 and h5 found in higher eukaryotes. The presence of hho1p in yeast has been implicated in DNA repair and the regulation of chromatin structure. Although biochemical studies have yet to definitively confirm that hho1p is indeed the yeast histone h1, the significant sequence homology and functional similarities suggest that hho1p is a linker histone in yeast. Furthermore, the existence of a gene, ypl127c, encoding a protein with high similarity to histone h1 from other species, further supports the presence of a linker histone in the yeast genome.",Yes
Can protein coding exons originate from ALU sequences?,Yes,"Protein coding exons can indeed originate from ALU sequences. The evidence supporting this is derived from extensive transcriptome profiling of human tissues using high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and RT-PCR analysis. Research has shown that thousands of human genes contain spliced exons derived from ALU elements. Furthermore, the presence of ALU exon-derived peptides in human proteins has been confirmed through RNA sequencing, ribosome profiling, and proteomics data from human tissues and cell lines. These findings indicate that ALU elements have contributed to the acquisition of novel protein sequences during primate and human evolution. In certain instances, such as in the RNA editing enzyme ADAR1, ALU exon peptides have been found to be incorporated into the catalytic domain, resulting in species-specific protein differences between primates and other mammals.",Yes
Is there evidence that tomato juice lowers cholesterol levels?,Yes,"Evidence from various studies indicates that consumption of tomato juice is associated with a significant reduction in total cholesterol levels. In particular, research has shown a decrease in total cholesterol from 157.6 mg/dl to 153.2 mg/dl (p = 0.008) and from 153.4 mg/dl to 147.4 mg/dl (p = 0.002) in different groups. These findings suggest that tomato juice may have a favorable impact on lipid metabolism and potentially contribute to a lower risk of cardiovascular diseases. Furthermore, the results demonstrate that tomato juice supplementation can lead to improvements in inflammation status and endothelial dysfunction, which are additional factors related to cardiovascular health.",Yes
Are there transposon-free regions in mammalian genomes?,No,"Justification: The mammalian genomes are comprised of 30-50% transposed elements (TES), with transposable elements (TEs) found within most genes. These TEs make up a large fraction of mammalian genomes, and more than half of the human and mouse genomes are comprised of repetitive sequences, such as TEs. The only presently spreading class of human transposable elements comprises non-LTR (long terminal repeat) retrotransposons, which cover approximately 5-6% of mammalian genomes. The vast majority of these TEs are truncated and mutated fragments of retrotransposons that are no longer capable of transposition. Therefore, it can be concluded that there are no transposon-free regions in mammalian genomes.",Yes
Are messenger RNA molecules epigenetically methylated?,Yes,"Messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules are indeed epigenetically methylated. Methylation is a prevalent posttranscriptional modification of RNAs, including mRNAs. Several identified methylation modifications in eukaryotic mRNAs include N(7)-methylguanosine (m(7)G) at the cap, N(6)-methyl-2'-O-methyladenosine (m(6)am), 2'-O-methylation (Nm) within the cap and internal positions, and internal N(6)-methyladenosine (m(6)A) and 5-methylcytosine (m(5)C). These modifications play important roles in RNA processing and metabolism, and are involved in various physiological and pathological processes. Methylation of mRNA bases such as N 6-methyladenosine (m6A) and 5-methylcytidine (m5C) are the most prevalent mRNA modifications found in eukaryotes.",No
Have gnotobiotic animal models been used for the study of bowel disease?,Yes,"Gnotobiotic animal models have been employed in the study of bowel diseases. These models, which are free from all microorganisms, are particularly useful in investigating the role of specific pathogens in disease development and progression. Among the gnotobiotic models used in pathogenesis and vaccine studies for Helicobacter pylori, a known contributor to gastric inflammation and ulcers, are the gnotobiotic pig and various species of rodents, including mice, rats, and gerbils. These models have contributed significantly to the understanding of the mechanistic basis of bowel diseases and the identification of potential therapeutic targets.",Yes
Is invasion and metastasis one of the hallmarks of cancer?,Yes,"Invasion and metastasis are indeed hallmarks of cancer. Invasion, the directed migration of tumor cells into adjacent tissues, is a defining characteristic of cancer malignancy and the first step towards metastasis. This process is governed by different cellular mechanisms than those driving the deregulated growth of tumors. The development of metastases is the major cause of death for cancer patients, although the mechanisms of tumor invasion and acquisition of the capability to metastasize remain unclear. Tumor invasion is a complex, multi-step biochemical process involving cell detachment, invasion, migration, intravasation and circulation, implantation, angiogenesis, and proliferation. The ability to invade tissue is a key component in the metastatic cascade, whereby cancer cells spread to distant parts of the host and initiate the growth of secondary tumors (metastases). The mortality associated with cancer depends upon the ability of malignant cells to invade and metastasize into adjacent and distant regions. A better understanding of the complex processes involved in cancer invasion may ultimately lead to treatments being developed which can localize cancer and prevent metastasis.",Yes
Is it possible to detect survivin protein expression in normal human adult tissues?,Yes,"Under normal circumstances, survivin protein expression is typically undetectable in most differentiated adult tissues. However, there are exceptions to this, as survivin expression has been observed in certain proliferating normal tissues and in specific cell types, such as normal adult CD34+ cells. Additionally, survivin protein expression has been detected in primary human osteoblastic cells on both the mRNA and protein levels. Therefore, it is possible to detect survivin protein expression in normal human adult tissues, although its expression is generally low compared to that in cancerous tissues.",Yes
Is progesterone effective for treatment of patients with traumatic brain injury based on clinical trial data?,No,"The clinical evidence from three small randomized controlled trials (RCTs) suggests that progesterone may improve the neurologic outcome of patients suffering from traumatic brain injury (TBI). However, two multi-center phase III clinical trials examining the protective potential of progesterone following TBI have recently failed to demonstrate any improvement in outcome. The failure of these phase III clinical trials to demonstrate the cerebroprotective efficiency of progesterone in TBI patients emphasizes the need for further review and refinement of both experimental and clinical study designs. Therefore, based on the available clinical trial data, it cannot be concluded that progesterone is effective for the treatment of patients with TBI.",Yes
Is there a role for the cylindromatosis tumor suppressor (CYLD) in lung cancer?,Yes,"The cylindromatosis tumor suppressor (CYLD) plays a role in inhibiting tumor development and progression in various human malignancies, including colon cancer, by acting as a negative regulator of nuclear factor-ÎºB (NF-ÎºB) and a key regulator of cell proliferation and inflammation. CYLD is a deubiquitinating enzyme that has been implicated in the regulation of thymocyte selection in a NF-ÎºB-essential-modulator (NEMO)-dependent manner. Loss of CYLD expression has been observed in various cancers, including chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and correlates with tumorigenesis. Therefore, it is plausible that CYLD may also have a role in lung cancer, given its involvement in tumor suppression and regulation of cellular processes implicated in cancer development and progression. However, further research is needed to elucidate the specific role of CYLD in lung cancer.",Yes
"Can we detect DNA strand asymmetries using dinucleotide relative abundance ""genomic signatures""?",Yes,"The utilization of dinucleotide relative abundance ""genomic signatures"" is indeed a viable approach to detect DNA strand asymmetries. These signatures, characterized by over- and under-abundances of oligonucleotides of a given length, serve as a filter for compositional trends and neighbor preferences at any shorter range. The compositional asymmetry of complementary bases in nucleotide sequences suggests the existence of mutational or selectional bias in the two strands of the DNA duplex. Measures of compositional strand bias, such as the âgc skew, the b(1) index, and the GC skew index, are crucial in quantifying the degree of strand asymmetry. This is the basis for determining the applicability of compositional analysis and comparing the strength of mutational bias in different biological machineries across various species.",Yes
Is there any relationship between histone ubiquitylation and splicing?,Yes,"Recent studies have elucidated a regulatory link between chromatin structure, histone modifications, and splicing regulation. Ubiquitin, a key player in cellular processes, has been found to have a direct role in the dynamics of splicing complexes. Specifically, histone ubiquitylation, predominantly targeting histones H2A and H2B, has been shown to stimulate the recruitment of early splicing factors, such as U1 and U2 snRNPs, onto nascent RNAs. This process is mediated by H2B ubiquitylation, not SET1-, SET2-, or DOT1-dependent H3 methylation. Furthermore, a ubiquitin mutant (I44A) that can enter the conjugation pathway but is compromised in downstream functions diminishes splicing activity by reducing the levels of the U4/U6-U5 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP). These findings suggest a previously unknown ubiquitin-dependent mechanism for controlling the pre-mRNA splicing pathway. Therefore, it can be concluded that there is a significant relationship between histone ubiquitylation and splicing.",Yes
Can SUMO affect calcium homeostasis?,Inconclusive,"The context does not provide information on the potential effects of SUMO (Small Ubiquitin-like Modifier) on calcium homeostasis. Calcium homeostasis is a complex process involving various factors such as calcium-sensing receptors, parathyroid hormone, vitamin D, and intracellular calcium concentrations. However, the role of SUMO in this process is not explicitly discussed in the provided context. Further research is needed to establish a link between SUMO and calcium homeostasis.",Yes
Have mutations in the GARS gene been identified to cause Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease Type 2D (CMT2D)?,Yes,"Justification: Mutations in the glycyl-tRNA synthetase (GARS) gene have been identified as the cause of Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease Type 2D (CMT2D). CMT2D is a dominantly inherited peripheral neuropathy characterized by impaired motor and sensory function in the distal extremities. The disease is caused by dominant, toxic, gain-of-function mutations in the widely expressed housekeeping gene, GARS. The mechanism by which these mutations mediate selective peripheral nerve toxicity is still largely unresolved. However, it is clear that mutations in the GARS gene play a significant role in the pathogenesis of CMT2D.",Yes
Does melanoma  occur in people of African origin ?,Yes,"Melanoma, a form of skin cancer, does occur in individuals of African origin, albeit at a lower incidence compared to Caucasians. The study reveals that malignant melanoma has been observed in black people in Malawi, contributing to the understanding of its occurrence in African populations. Despite being rare, melanoma in African-Americans and other minority ethnic populations is associated with invasive lesions and a more advanced stage of disease at diagnosis, leading to decreased survival compared to Caucasians. The research also indicates that African-Americans have a proportionately higher incidence of acral melanoma, including the acral lentiginous melanoma (ALM) histologic subtype and subungual melanoma (SM). Furthermore, primary acquired melanosis can lead to the development of melanoma even in individuals of African descent.",Yes
Are people with blood group O protected against severe Malaria?,Yes,"Justification:

     Scientific evidence suggests that individuals with blood group O are protected against severe malaria. Studies have consistently demonstrated that blood group O confers resistance against severe falciparum infection, a type of malaria caused by the Plasmodium falciparum parasite. This protective effect is thought to be due to the influence of ABO blood group antigens on macrophage clearance of infected erythrocytes. In malaria-endemic regions, there is a predominance of blood group O, which may provide a survival advantage over other blood groups in complicated malaria cases. Furthermore, meta-analyses of previous studies have highlighted the protective nature of blood group O against severe malaria. Therefore, based on the available evidence, it can be concluded that people with blood group O are indeed protected against severe malaria.",Yes
Is there a crystal structure of the full-length of the flaviviridae NS5(Methyltransferase - RNA depended RNA Polymerase) ?,Yes,"The crystal structure of the full-length flaviviridae NS5, which includes both the methyltransferase (MTase) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) domains, has been reported. The structure of dengue virus NS5 was determined, revealing eight molecules of NS5 arranged as four independent dimers in the crystallographic asymmetric unit. This structural information is valuable for understanding the cooperative function of the MTase and RdRp domains in viral genome replication and methylation, as well as for the development of antiviral drugs targeting this essential flavivirus protein.",Yes
Can venlafaxine block NET and SERT?,Yes,"Venlafaxine, an antidepressant belonging to the serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), has been shown to block both the serotonin transporter (SERT) and norepinephrine transporter (NET). The medication inhibits the reuptake of serotonin, norepinephrine, and, to a lesser extent, dopamine. Venlafaxine blocks the synaptic reuptake of serotonin in lower doses and also blocks the reuptake of norepinephrine in higher doses. It has been demonstrated to be a potent SERT antagonist and a less potent NET antagonist in vivo. The medication has been shown to inhibit binding to the human NET and 5-HT transporters with k(i) values of 2480 and 82 nm, respectively, and with a k(i) ratio of 30. Additionally, venlafaxine has been shown to produce dose-dependent inhibition of both SERT and NET.",Yes
Can vitamin B1 deficiency cause encephalopathy?,Yes,"Vitamin B1 (thiamine) deficiency is known to cause Wernicke's encephalopathy, a severe neurological disorder characterized by consciousness changes, ocular abnormalities, and ataxia. This condition results from a dietary deficiency of vitamin B1 and can lead to significant neurological impairment if left untreated. The deficiency can be caused by inadequate intake, malabsorption, increased metabolic demand, or genetic factors affecting thiamine metabolism. The pathophysiology of Wernicke's encephalopathy involves damage to the brain's thalamus and hypothalamus, leading to neuronal loss and gliosis. Early recognition and prompt treatment with thiamine replacement can prevent permanent neurological damage and improve clinical outcomes. Therefore, it is crucial to maintain adequate thiamine levels to prevent the development of Wernicke's encephalopathy and other neurological complications associated with vitamin B1 deficiency.",Yes
Are epigenetic modifications implicated in cardiovascular development and disease?,Yes,"Epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation and histone modifications, have been reported to play a significant role in the pathological mechanisms of various cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). These modifications are key regulators of gene transcription and are often associated with maladaptive processes underlying CVDs, including atherosclerosis, inflammation, hypertension, and diabetes. DNA methylation, in particular, has been identified as a crucial epigenetic mechanism contributing to the developmental origins of adult CVDs. Epigenetic aberrations caused by environmental factors and lifestyle choices have also been associated with the development of cardiovascular disorders. Moreover, epigenetic mechanisms have been found to regulate chromatin structure and lineage-specific gene expression during cardiovascular development and disease. The development of new chromatin-modifying drugs further suggests that targeting epigenetic changes could be a promising approach to reduce the burden of CVDs.",No
Can exosomes be detected in urine?,Yes,"Exosomes, a subset of extracellular vesicles, have been identified in urine and can be isolated through methods such as ultracentrifugation. These nanometer-sized vesicles are released by various cells, including renal epithelial cells, under both normal and pathological conditions. Exosomes in urine contain molecular constituents such as proteins and genetic materials, which can provide valuable diagnostic and pathophysiological information. The detection of exosomes in urine has been reported in numerous studies, where they have been used as a starting material for biomarker discovery in various diseases, including urological and nonurological cancers. The protein cargo of urine exosomes has shown potential as a source for biomarkers, offering insights into the health status of the kidney and other organs. Exosomal markers have been detected in as little as 0.5 ml of urine, demonstrating the feasibility of analyzing urinary exosomes in clinical settings.",Yes
Is Kanzaki disease associated with deficiency in alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase?,Yes,"Kanzaki disease is indeed associated with a deficiency in alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase. This disease, also known as Schindler/Kanzaki disease, is a rare hereditary lysosomal storage disorder caused by the deficiency or defective activity of the alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase enzyme. The deficiency of this enzyme leads to the accumulation of certain substances in the lysosomes, resulting in the manifestation of the disease. The profound deficiency of alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase activity in Kanzaki disease patients, compared to controls, has been demonstrated through assays of substrates with fibroblast homogenates and confirmed by thin-layer chromatography analyses.",Yes
Is Mycobacterium avium less susceptible to antibiotics than Mycobacterium tuberculosis?,Yes,"Mycobacterium avium (M. avium) is a species of nontuberculous mycobacteria that is less susceptible to antibiotics than Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis). M. avium has been found to be intrinsically resistant to several classes of antibiotics, and an increasing number of strains isolated from patients exhibit resistance to most antibiotics considered for treatment of infections by this mycobacterium. In contrast, M. tuberculosis has been the subject of recent advances in genetics and pathogenesis investigation, and its pathogenic strategies are better understood. Additionally, contrary to most antimycobacterials, the whole-cell activity of ept was greater against M. abscessus than M. tuberculosis, but crystallographic and equilibrium binding data showed that ept binds theirsMabs and theirsMTB with similar residues and dissociation constants. As such, M. abscessus is clinically resistant to the entire regimen of front-line M. tuberculosis drugs, and treatment with antibiotics that do inhibit M. abscessus in the lab results in cure rates of 50% or less. This suggests that M. avium is less susceptible to antibiotics than M. tuberculosis.",No
Are there conserved noncoding elements identified between genomes of human and teleosts?,Yes,"Justification: Conserved noncoding elements (CNEs) have been identified between genomes of humans and teleosts, predominantly flanking genes active during morphogenesis and enriched for positive transcriptional regulatory elements. These CNEs are often more conserved between vertebrate species than protein-coding exons and are hypothesized to have important biological functions, such as acting as enhancer elements under evolutionary constraint. Fish-mammal genomic comparisons, including those between humans and teleosts, have proven powerful in identifying CNEs likely to be cis-regulatory in nature, with many shown to act as tissue-specific enhancers associated with genes involved in transcriptional regulation of development.",Yes
Does cortical spreading depression appear in ischemic penumbra following ischemic stroke?,Yes,"Cortical spreading depression (CSD) has been observed in the penumbral zone of the brain in rats with focal cerebral ischemia, as well as in the cortical border zones of experimental focal ischemia. CSD is characterized by spreading depression-like peri-infarct depolarizations, which not only characterize but also worsen penumbra conditions. In addition, recent studies have shown that the brain ischemic area defined by decreased apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) obtained by diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) during the first hours of ischemic stroke includes a significant part of the ischemic penumbra. Furthermore, transient peri-infarct depolarizations have been found to emerge not only in cortical but also in striatal gray matter, thereby demonstrating the existence of subcortical zones of ischemic penumbra. These observations suggest that CSD does indeed appear in ischemic penumbra following ischemic stroke.",Yes
Is phospholamban a regulatory/inhibitory protein of the Ca ATPase SERCA?,Yes,"Phospholamban is a pentameric transmembrane phosphoprotein that functions as an inhibitory cofactor for cardiac Ca-ATPase (SERCA2). It regulates the activity of the Ca(2+)-transporting ATPase (SERCA2a) in the cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum by modulating the active transport of Ca2+ into the lumen of the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Phospholamban acts as a reversible inhibitor of SERCA2, repressing its activity, and this inhibition is relieved upon phosphorylation of phospholamban in response to beta-adrenergic stimulation. Phospholamban suppresses the Ca2+ pump ATPase at two different sites, the cytoplasmic domain for Vmax and the transmembrane domain for Kca, and camp-dependent phosphorylation de-suppresses these inhibitory effects on the ATPase. Thus, phospholamban is a key regulator of Ca(2+) homeostasis and contractility in the heart.",Yes
Is Alpers disease inherited in an autosomal recessive mode?,Yes,"Alpers-Huttenlocher Syndrome (AHS) is a rare disorder that is inherited in an autosomal recessive mode. This means that an individual must inherit two copies of the mutated gene, one from each parent, in order to develop the disease. Autosomal recessive inheritance is characterized by the fact that both males and females can be affected, and the disease is typically not passed on from a single affected parent to their offspring. In the context of AHS, genetic testing can be used to identify the presence of mutations in the genes responsible for the disease, which can aid in the diagnosis and management of the condition.",Yes
Is vemurafenib effective for hairy-cell leukemia?,Yes,"Vemurafenib has been shown to be highly effective in patients with relapsed or refractory hairy-cell leukemia. The safety and activity of the oral BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib were assessed in patients with hairy-cell leukemia who had relapsed after treatment with a purine analogue or who had disease that was refractory to purine analogues. Vemurafenib is a selective BRAF inhibitor that has become a treatment option in patients with Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH). The drug has also been approved for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic BRAFV600E-mutant melanoma. The improved survival with vemurafenib treatment (11.47 months) in patients with BRAF V600 mutation has been confirmed in previous studies. Vemurafenib is now approved for use in this patient population. The drug is an adenosine triphosphate-competitive, reversible, and highly selective BRAF kinase inhibitor targeted at BRAF-V600E. Vemurafenib improves outcomes for patients with advanced BRAFV600 mutation-positive melanoma compared with cytotoxic chemotherapy. The BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib is currently used for treating patients with BRAF V600E mutant melanoma. Our data suggest that vemurafenib at the dose of 240 mg once a day could be sufficient to maintain a complete hematological remission after an initial induction treatment with low-dose vemurafenib (2 Ã 240 mg) daily without inducing major toxicity.",Yes
Is there an association between TERT promoter mutation and survival of glioma patients?,Yes,"The TERT promoter mutation has been identified as a promising biomarker for predicting worse prognosis in glioma patients. A meta-analysis of 11 studies indicated that TERT promoter mutations were significantly associated with worse prognosis (HR = 2.07, 95% CI = 1.58-2.71, p < 0.00001). In addition, a separate meta-analysis of nine studies with adjusted outcomes suggested that TERT promoter mutations were independently associated with worse prognosis (HR = 2.28, 95% CI = 1.72-3.01, p < 0.00001). TERT mutations were also found to be significantly associated with compromised overall survival (OS) (HR = 1.38, 95% CI = 1.15-1.67) and progression-free survival (PFS) (HR = 1.31, 95% CI = 1.06-1.63) in glioma patients. These findings suggest that TERT promoter mutations are valuable prognostic and predictive biomarkers of glioma.",Yes
Does ziconotide bind to N-type calcium channels?,Yes,"Ziconotide, a synthetic peptide analogue of the Ï-conotoxin MVIIC, has been shown to selectively bind to N-type voltage-sensitive calcium channels. This binding obstructs neurotransmission and contributes to ziconotide's potent and selective blockade of these channels. As a result, ziconotide has been used as an intrathecal analgesic for the management of chronic intractable pain, as it effectively reduces the perception of pain by blocking N-type calcium channels in the spinal cord. Ziconotide's therapeutic benefit is derived from its ability to bind to N-type calcium channels with high affinity, making it a selective peptide antagonist of these channels.",Yes
Is stop codon bypass possible?,Yes,"Stop codon bypass, also known as stop codon readthrough, is indeed possible. This phenomenon occurs when the ribosome fails to recognize a stop codon and continues translating into the untranslated region of a transcript. The miscoding can be due to molecular errors, a dedicated regulatory environment, or the action of a readthrough compound. The sequence around stop codons strongly influences termination efficiency and the likelihood of alternative events such as frameshifting and stop codon readthrough. Notably, highly expressed genes exhibit clear preferences among stop codons and their contexts, while inefficient stop signals are exploited in various recoding processes. The recognition of the stop codon by the translation machinery is essential for terminating translation at the correct position and synthesizing a protein of the correct size. However, stop codon readthrough can occur when a near-cognate tRNA outcompetes the termination factor in decoding the stop codon, leading to the continuation of the elongation phase of protein synthesis.",Yes
Is the protein Î²1-integrin recycled?,Yes,"The protein Î²1-integrin undergoes a process of endocytosis and recycling, as evidenced by its internalization upon ligand binding, trafficking to early endosomes, and subsequent return to the plasma membrane through recycling endosomes. This recycling process is facilitated by proteins such as rabgap1, which plays a crucial role in the recycling of endocytosed active Î²1 integrins to the plasma membrane. The recycling machinery for Î²1 integrins involves rab11, and distinct trafficking mechanisms exist for different integrin subtypes, such as Î±3Î²1 and Î±6Î²1. The regulation of Î²1 integrin recycling is implicated in various cellular processes, including cell migration, differentiation, and tissue development.",Yes
Are BBS mutations involved in syndromic Hirschsprung disease?,No,"Justification: The context provided does not mention any involvement of BBS mutations in syndromic Hirschsprung disease. Instead, it discusses the association of variants in or near RET, EDNRB, and ZFHX1B genes with Hirschsprung disease. Therefore, based on the given context, it can be concluded that BBS mutations are not involved in syndromic Hirschsprung disease.",Yes
Is there any software for automated analysis of immuno-histochemistry images?,Yes,"Recent advances in computerized expert systems and machine vision have enabled the development of software for automated analysis of immuno-histochemistry images. This software utilizes image analysis algorithms to segment tissue features, grade histological abnormalities, and locate diagnostically useful areas within complex histological scenes. The increasing demand for immunohistochemistry in clinical diagnostics, coupled with a shortage of staff in histology laboratories, has led to the need for automation in immunohistochemistry. Digital immunohistochemistry is one of the most promising applications of new generation image analysis, and it can help pathologists in their daily work by enabling fast and efficient analysis of high numbers of fully digitalized histologic sections. Several commercially available software packages offer image analysis capabilities, although they may require relatively high levels of computer skills and can be expensive. A potential solution to this is software that can work on a user's laptop or workstation and provide quick and easy-to-use analysis of data.",Yes
Is TALEN being used on stem cells?,Yes,"TALEN (Transcription Activator-Like Effector Nucleases) is indeed being used on stem cells. TALEN is a genome editing technology that enables precise and targeted modification of DNA sequences. In the context of stem cells, TALEN can be employed to introduce specific genetic changes into stem cells, thereby modulating their properties and enhancing their therapeutic potential. This technique has been utilized in various studies to manipulate stem cells for therapeutic applications, such as the treatment of genetic disorders and tissue regeneration. However, it is important to note that the use of TALEN, like other genome editing tools, requires careful consideration of ethical and safety aspects.",Yes
Is there an association between bruxism and reflux,Yes,"Recent studies have identified a significant association between bruxism and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Bruxism, characterized by teeth grinding and clenching, has been found to be prevalent in GERD patients. GERD, a common gastrointestinal problem, is also highly associated with sleep bruxism (SB). Experimental esophageal acidification, which plays a role in GERD pathogenesis, has been shown to induce rhythmic masticatory muscle activity, including SB, in healthy individuals. Furthermore, GERD has been identified as a risk factor for bruxism after adjustment for confounding variables. The relationship between bruxism and reflux symptoms has been linked to severe tooth wear, with individuals experiencing both conditions for extended periods showing a significantly higher risk of tooth wear. These findings suggest a complex interplay between bruxism and GERD, with potential implications for tooth wear and overall oral health.",Yes
Can a peptide aptamer be used as protein inhibitor?,Yes,"Peptide aptamers have the potential to serve as protein inhibitors due to their unique structural features, which enable them to bind with their target proteins with strong affinity and high specificity. These aptamers can be generated by yeast two-hybrid methods and have been shown to disrupt specific protein interactions, thus representing a useful method for manipulating protein function in vivo. In vitro-selected RNA aptamers have also been identified as potential inhibitors of disease-related proteins. The ability of peptide aptamers to bind and inhibit their target protein has been demonstrated through the discovery of an aptamer that strongly inhibits PTP1B in vitro with a Ki of less than 600 pm. Four peptides with significantly decreased modification in the presence of the aptamer were identified and subjected to N-terminal sequence analysis. Therefore, peptide aptamers represent a promising new class of molecules for drug design and protein therapy, with potential applications in basic and applied research for a broad variety of different types of diseases.",Yes
Are integrins part of the extracellular matrix?,No,"Integrins are not part of the extracellular matrix (ECM) but are rather transmembrane receptors that mediate cell-ECM interactions. Integrins are heterodimeric glycoproteins composed of Î± and Î² subunits, which act as cell surface receptors for various ECM components, such as laminin, fibronectin, vitronectin, and collagen. These interactions facilitate the linkage of the ECM to cytoskeletal proteins, enabling cells to adhere, migrate, and respond to their environment. Integrins also play a crucial role in regulating multiple cellular processes, including adhesion, migration, proliferation, and growth factor-dependent signaling. In summary, integrins are not part of the ECM but are essential receptors that mediate cell-ECM interactions and contribute to various cellular functions.",No
Is Calcium homeostasis important in cardiac physiology and pathophysiology?,Yes,"Calcium homeostasis is crucial in cardiac physiology and pathophysiology. Calcium plays a fundamental role in the maintenance of myocardial function and vascular tone. It is a key player in cardiomyocyte homeostasis, with roles ranging from excitation-contraction coupling to metabolic and structural signaling. Calcium is an important mediator in cardiac excitation, and disorders in cardiac calcium homeostasis have a significant impact on the cardiac action potential. Calcium cycling is essential for the excitation-contraction coupling of cardiomyocytes, thereby playing a key role in cardiac functionality. Disturbed myocardial calcium handling is a hallmark of various cardiovascular diseases, such as congestive heart failure, cardiac hypertrophy, and certain types of tachyarrhythmias. The control of intracellular calcium is central to the regulation of cardiac contractility. Abnormal calcium homeostasis is often associated with chronic cardiovascular diseases, such as hypertension, heart failure, or cardiac arrhythmias. Proper cardiac calcium homeostasis is essential for normal excitation-contraction coupling. Disruption of myocellular calcium handling can lead to cardiac pathologies such as arrhythmias and heart failure. Both intra- and extracellular calcium play multiple roles in the physiology and pathophysiology of cardiomyocytes, especially in stimulus-contraction coupling.",Yes
Is the gene DUX4 epigenetically regulated in somatic cells?,Yes,"DUX4, a gene encoding a transcription factor involved in early embryogenesis, is epigenetically regulated in somatic cells. In most healthy somatic tissues, DUX4 is heavily repressed by multiple genetic and epigenetic mechanisms, including DNA methylation, histone modifications, and noncoding RNAs. The derepression of DUX4 in somatic cells is caused by either repeat array contraction (FSHD1) or mutations in the chromatin repressor SMCHD1 (FSHD2). The human double-homeodomain retrogene DUX4 is expressed in the testis and epigenetically repressed in somatic tissues. The somatic cytotoxicity caused by DUX4 expression is conserved when expressed in cells and animals ranging from fly to mouse. These findings suggest that DUX4 is epigenetically regulated in somatic cells, and its aberrant expression is linked to facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD).",Yes
Have hESC been tested for the treatment of age-related macular degeneration?,Yes,"Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) have been tested for the treatment of age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Clinical trials using hESC-derived retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells are currently underway to assess their safety and efficacy in treating AMD. Previous studies have demonstrated that hESC-RPE cells can serve as a replacement therapy for advanced stages of AMD, offering a potentially inexhaustible source of RPE cells. Furthermore, hESC- and induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived retinal transplantation has been shown to be a promising therapeutic approach for end-stage retinal degeneration diseases such as AMD. The immunological properties of hESC- and iPSC-derived retinal cells have also been characterized, revealing their potential advantages in terms of immune suppression and low expression of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I and II molecules. While previous trials have reported improved visual acuity in patients with AMD, further studies are needed to fully understand the long-term effects of hESC-RPE cell transplantation on retinal structure and function.",Yes
Does d-tubocurarine (d-TC) induces irreversible inhibition of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) at the neuromuscular junction?,No,"Justification: The context indicates that d-tubocurarine (d-TC) is a competitive antagonist of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) at the neuromuscular junction. This means that d-TC binds reversibly to the receptor, competing with acetylcholine for binding sites. The competitive nature of this interaction implies that d-TC does not cause irreversible inhibition of the nAChR. Instead, the inhibitory effect of d-TC can be overcome by increasing the concentration of acetylcholine, which can displace d-TC from the receptor. Therefore, it can be concluded that d-TC does not induce irreversible inhibition of the nAChR at the neuromuscular junction.",Yes
Is zyxin a focal adhesion protein?,Yes,"Zyxin is a focal adhesion protein, as evidenced by its primary localization at focal adhesion plaques and its critical role in actin filament polymerization and cell motility. It is a member of the focal adhesion complex and has been implicated in the modulation of cell adhesion and motility. Zyxin is also hypothesized to be a mechano-sensor in integrin-mediated responses to mechanical force. Furthermore, it is a focal-adhesion-associated phosphoprotein that regulates actin assembly by binding to vasp family members through n-terminal proline-rich motifs. Zyxin co-localizes with integrins at sites of cell-substratum adhesion and is postulated to serve as a docking site for the assembly of multimeric protein complexes involved in regulating cell motility. It is an evolutionarily conserved protein that is concentrated at sites of cell adhesion, where it associates with members of the enabled (ena)/vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (vasp) family of cytoskeletal regulators and is postulated to play a role in cytoskeletal dynamics and signaling.",Yes
Could DNA (cytosine-5-)-methyltransferases serve as tumour markers?,Yes,"DNA (cytosine-5-)-methyltransferases (DNMTs) can serve as tumor markers due to their significant role in DNA methylation, which is an important epigenetic modification. Alterations in DNA methylation patterns, particularly 5-methylcytosine (5mc) methylation, are often associated with tumorigenesis and cancer progression. The development of new tools for tracking the activity of human DNMTs is an important goal given their role as cancer biomarkers and epigenetic modulators. Aberrant DNA methylation patterns are found in cancer cells, and the global and gene-specific methylation of certain genes may serve as useful biomarkers for the early detection and clinical management of cancer. DNMTs catalyze the covalent addition of a methyl group to the c-5 position of cytosine, and their expression levels have been analyzed in various types of cancer, such as colorectal adenocarcinoma and gastric carcinomas. The correlation between 5mc modification and tumor microenvironment cell infiltration has also been assessed.",Yes
Is phospholamban phosphorylated by Protein kinase A?,Yes,"Phospholamban is indeed phosphorylated by Protein Kinase A (PKA). PKA is a cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase that plays a crucial role in the phosphorylation of phospholamban. Upon beta-adrenergic stimulation, the activation of the G protein leads to an increase in cyclic AMP levels, which in turn alters the structure of PKA and leads to phospholamban phosphorylation. This phosphorylation modulates the inhibitory activity of phospholamban, the endogenous regulator of the sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA). The degree of phospholamban phosphorylation, determined by the interaction of specific protein kinases and phosphatases, is an important control for sarcoplasmic reticulum function and the contraction-relaxation cycle in the myocardium.",No
Are there telemedicine applications for chronic pain management?,Yes,"Telemedicine applications have been demonstrated to be feasible and cost-saving for chronic pain management. The use of telemedicine technology for chronic pain consultations has been evaluated in a pilot study, which found that it was satisfactory to both patients and pain physicians. Telemedicine interventions, such as telepain, have been developed to address the need for pain specialist consultation regarding pain and symptom management issues in non-academic medical centers. Telehealth technologies can bridge geographic distance and improve patients' quality of care in communities where access to pain specialists has previously been unavailable. Telemedicine has also been used extensively in various settings, including monitoring patient treatment response and counseling. The integration of telemedicine as a supplement to musculoskeletal-based patient encounters may be feasible in sports medicine. Telemedicine is a cost-effective and easy-to-implement alternative to face-to-face care for patients with chronic diseases. The true potential of virtual care models lies in their ability to improve access to chronic condition care for medically complex individuals. Telemedicine is likely to represent an important part of the future of chronic pain therapies and should be progressively integrated by healthcare providers.",Yes
Is paramyxovirus involved in human subacute thyroiditis?,Inconclusive,"The involvement of paramyxovirus in human subacute thyroiditis is currently inconclusive due to limited data and elusive proof. Although paramyxovirus has been isolated from children with respiratory illness and is believed to be involved in Paget's disease of bone, its direct association with subacute thyroiditis remains unclear. The hypothesis that viruses, including paramyxovirus, may account for some thyroid disorders in humans is supported by experimental observations. However, more research is needed to establish a definitive link between paramyxovirus and human subacute thyroiditis.",Yes
Is there any link between the aurora B kinase and the polycomb protein ring1B?,Yes,"There is a potential link between the Aurora B kinase (AURKB) and the polycomb protein Ring1B (RING1B). While the context does not explicitly state a direct interaction between AURKB and RING1B, it provides information on their respective roles and interactions with other proteins, which suggests a possible indirect connection. AURKB is involved in the regulation of mitosis and is overexpressed in retinoblastoma (RB), making it a potential therapeutic target. RING1B, a core subunit of the PRC1 complex, plays a crucial role in histone H2A ubiquitination and gene silencing processes. The context also mentions that RING1B's E3 ligase activity on histone H2A is enhanced by BMI1, another PRC1 complex component. Given that both AURKB and RING1B are implicated in cancer development and stem cell maintenance, and their respective roles in cellular processes, it is plausible that there may be an indirect link between them, potentially through shared signaling pathways or downstream effects on gene expression and cell cycle regulation. However, further research is necessary to elucidate the exact nature of this potential connection.",Yes
Is CD99 encoded by MIC2 gene?,Yes,"CD99 is indeed encoded by the MIC2 gene. This 32 kDa transmembrane glycoprotein, also known as p30/32, is a product of the MIC2 gene. The MIC2 gene is responsible for encoding the CD99 protein, which is present on leukocytes and activated endothelium. The MIC2 gene is localized to the pseudoautosomal regions of both Xp and Yp chromosomes. The CD99 protein functions as a tumor suppressor involved in downregulating the Src family of tyrosine kinases. The high conservation of the CD99 gene among species implies its essential function.",Yes
Has the fungus Ashbya gossypii got many nuclei that share cytoplasm?,Yes,"The filamentous fungus Ashbya gossypii exhibits a multinucleate cellular organization, with numerous nuclei sharing a common cytoplasm. This multinucleated state is distinct from the unicellular morphology of its closely related yeast species, such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The nuclei within Ashbya gossypii divide asynchronously, indicating that they do not follow a synchronized cell cycle. Furthermore, neighboring nuclei in Ashbya gossypii cells have been observed to be in different cell cycle stages despite their close physical proximity. The presence of an autonomous cytoplasmic microtubule cytoskeleton emanating from each nucleus and the extensive bidirectional movements and bypassings of nuclei suggest a dynamic interplay between the nuclei and the shared cytoplasm in Ashbya gossypii.",Yes
Is microRNA(miRNA) 30 involved in post-ischemic cardiac remodeling?,Yes,"MicroRNA-30 (miR-30) is indeed involved in post-ischemic cardiac remodeling. The evidence suggests that miR-30d, a member of the miR-30 family, is implicated as a biomarker in left ventricular remodeling and clinical outcomes in heart failure patients. Lower expression of miR-30d in the heart and plasma extracellular vesicles is associated with adverse remodeling in both rodent models and human subjects. Furthermore, miR-30e has been shown to attenuate cardiac dysfunction and fibrosis in a rat cardiac remodeling model, while forced expression of miR-30c-5p in rats effectively reduced infarct area, cardiac apoptosis, oxidative stress, and inflammation induced by myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury. These findings collectively support the role of miR-30 in post-ischemic cardiac remodeling.",Yes
Is statin use associated with improved outcomes after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage?,Inconclusive,"The efficacy of statin therapy in treating aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) remains a topic of debate. While some studies have reported a reduced incidence of vasospasm, delayed cerebral ischemia, and mortality in statin-treated patients, others have not observed significant benefits. The present systematic review does not lend statistically significant support to the finding of a beneficial effect of statins in patients with aneurysmal SAH. However, it is important to note that statins have pleiotropic effects that are considered beneficial in preventing cerebral vasospasm and delayed cerebral ischemia after aneurysmal SAH. Further research is needed to elucidate the potential benefits of statin therapy in this patient population.",Yes
Does molindone affect body weight?,Yes,"Molindone has been shown to affect body weight, contradicting the common opinion that it does not contribute to weight gain compared to other antipsychotics. In a retrospective review, molindone was tested in 9 hospitalized chronic schizophrenic patients. The results demonstrated an average weight loss of 7.6 kg after 3 months of treatment, with most of the loss occurring during the first month. This weight-reducing property of molindone suggests that it can indeed impact body weight, albeit in a manner that promotes weight loss rather than gain.",Yes
Is the SDHAF2 gene  encoding a protein necessary for flavination of SDHA?,Yes,"The SDHAF2 gene encodes a protein that is necessary for flavination of SDHA. This protein is an assembly factor required for FAD insertion into the SDH1 subunit of the succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) complex, which is essential for SDH assembly and function. The increased levels of SDHAF2 suggest that the stabilization of soluble FAD-SDH1 depends on SDHAF2 availability. SDH assembly appears to require FAD binding but not necessarily covalent FAD attachment. However, the enzymatic function of SDH is dependent on covalent attachment of FAD on the ~70-kDa flavoprotein subunit SDH1. Therefore, SDHAF2 plays a crucial role in the flavination of SDHA and the assembly of the SDH complex.",No
Could Arimidex (anastrozole) cause hot flashes?,Yes,"Arimidex (anastrozole) is a potent aromatase inhibitor that reduces circulating estrogen levels. The decrease in estrogen levels can lead to symptoms such as hot flashes, which are a common vasomotor disorder that causes distress in menopausal women and can be debilitating in men with prostate cancer who are treated with androgen deprivation therapy. In clinical trials, anastrozole was associated with a significantly lower incidence of hot flushes compared to tamoxifen, but the incidence was still present. Therefore, it is possible that Arimidex (anastrozole) can cause hot flashes as a side effect.",Yes
Are Alu elements transcribed?,Yes,"Alu elements, which are the most abundant type of transposable elements in the human genome, are indeed transcribed. They are frequently transcribed into pre-mRNAs as they are common in protein-coding genes. Alu elements are transcribed in two different ways, by two independent polymerases: RNA Polymerase II and III. They can be transcribed as distinct RNA Polymerase III transcripts and as part of RNA Polymerase II transcripts. Alu RNAs transcribed from these elements are present at low levels during normal cell growth, but various stress conditions increase their abundance, suggesting a potential physiological function for Alu transcripts.",Yes
Are chromomethylases present in animal genomes?,No,"The context does not provide information on the presence of chromomethylases in animal genomes. The focus of the context is on the distribution and characteristics of beta-carbonic anhydrase (CA) enzymes in various organisms, including animals. The study investigates the presence of beta-CA sequences in 55 metazoan species and the evolution of the complement system in animals. However, there is no mention of chromomethylases or their presence in animal genomes. Therefore, based on the given context, it cannot be confirmed that chromomethylases are present in animal genomes.",Yes
Is low T3 syndrome related with high BNP in cardiac patients?,Yes,"In cardiac patients, low T3 syndrome is significantly related to high levels of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP). Research has demonstrated an inverse correlation between serum BNP and triiodothyronine (T3) levels, indicating that low T3 is associated with high plasma BNP levels rather than worsening of hemodynamics. This relationship remains significant even in patients with normal BNP levels. Furthermore, patients with low T3 syndrome have a higher median concentration of NT-proBNP compared to those with normal FT3 levels. Treatment with T3 has been shown to decrease serum BNP while increasing total T3, further supporting the inverse correlation between these two biologic factors. Therefore, low T3 syndrome can be considered a predictor of poor outcome in patients with cardiac dysfunction and is independently prognostic in cardiovascular patients.",Yes
Is delayed enhancement documented in patients with non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy?,Yes,"In patients with non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), delayed enhancement has been documented. The pattern of delayed enhancement in DCM is different from that seen in ischemic cardiomyopathy, often characterized by mid-wall, patchy, or diffuse locations. This contrasts with the subendocardial or transmural extension typically observed in ischemic cardiomyopathy. The presence of delayed enhancement in DCM is believed to reflect the presence of scarring or various degrees of fibrosis in the left ventricular myocardium. Delayed enhancement magnetic resonance imaging has been increasingly used for the diagnosis of patients with non-ischemic myocardial disease, including DCM, and can provide valuable information for differentiating between ischemic and non-ischemic cardiomyopathies.",Yes
Has overexpression of sirtuins been reported to increase lifespan in budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae)?,Yes,"The overexpression of sirtuins, specifically Sir2, has been reported to increase lifespan in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This effect is thought to be mediated by the role of Sir2 as a NAD+-dependent protein deacetylase, which is involved in various cellular processes, including DNA repair and stress response. The activation of Sir2 and other sirtuins by pharmacological agents, such as resveratrol and Sirtuin Activating Compounds (STACs), has been shown to extend the lifespan of yeast and other organisms, including Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster. However, the use of appropriate controls and standardization of genetic background is crucial to accurately determine the effects of sirtuin overexpression on lifespan. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, calorie restriction has also been shown to extend lifespan by increasing the activity of Sir2. Overall, these findings suggest that sirtuins play a role in determining lifespan and represent a promising target for the development of interventions to promote healthy aging.",Yes
Is TREM2 associated with Alzheimer's disease?,Yes,"TREM2, a gene encoding the Triggering Receptor Expressed on Myeloid cells 2, has been identified as a significant risk factor for Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Genome-wide association studies have revealed that the rs75932628-T variant of TREM2 is associated with an increased risk of developing AD and other neurodegenerative diseases. This gene is specifically expressed in brain microglia and is thought to modulate their functions in response to key AD pathologies, such as amyloid-Î² (AÎ²) plaques and tau tangles. Mutations in TREM2 have been linked to increased AD risk, and loss of function of this key receptor contributes to the development of AD. TREM2 is a microglial surface receptor that mediates the degradation disorder of AÎ² in AD. While the exact mechanism by which TREM2 influences susceptibility to AD is currently unknown, its role in regulating phagocytic and inflammatory microglial responses to brain pathology is thought to be crucial.",Yes
Does the protein mTOR regulate autophagy?,Yes,"The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) plays a critical role in regulating autophagy, a cellular process that degrades and recycles damaged organelles and proteins. mTOR is a serine/threonine kinase that functions as a central regulator of autophagy by modulating multiple aspects of the autophagy process, including initiation, progression, and termination. mTOR suppresses the initiation of the autophagic process when nutrients, growth factors, and energy are available, while inhibition of mTOR, such as by small molecules like rapamycin, results in activation of autophagy. mTOR regulates autophagy by controlling the activity of the unc51-like kinase 1 (ULK1) complex and vacuolar protein sorting 34 (VPS34) complex, as well as the intracellular distribution of transcription factors such as TFEB/TFE3 and proto-lysosome tubule reformation. The mechanisms regulating mTOR and autophagy remain incompletely understood, but recent evidence suggests that mTOR is involved in the pathogenesis of various diseases, including Parkinson's disease and cancer.",Yes
Has proteomics been used in the study of Pick's disease?,No,"The context does not provide information on the use of proteomics in the study of Pick's disease. Instead, it focuses on the immunohistochemical analysis of apolipoprotein E (apoe) and its potential role in the pathogenesis of Pick's disease. The study also describes the regional and laminar distribution of Pick bodies, as well as the pathological profile of the disease, including focal frontotemporal atrophy, neuronal loss, astrocytosis, and the presence of neurofibrillary tangles. However, the use of proteomics, a large-scale study of proteins, is not mentioned in the context.",Yes
Are there any urine biomarkers for bladder cancer diagnosis?,Yes,"Elaboration: Numerous molecular urine markers for the diagnosis of bladder cancer have been developed and evaluated over the past several decades. These markers include potential biochemical markers excreted in the urine of bladder cancer patients, as well as putative metabolite markers for the detection of early-stage bladder cancer. Current methods in the noninvasive detection and surveillance of bladder cancer via urine analysis include voided urine cytology (VUC) and some diagnostic urinary protein biomarkers. However, due to the poor sensitivity of VUC and high false-positive rates of currently available protein assays, detection of bladder cancer via urinalysis remains a challenge. Despite this, urine markers have been extensively studied to help improve the diagnosis of bladder cancer with the goal of complementing or even replacing cystoscopy. Markers for aberrant methylation may be a potential gateway for monitoring bladder cancer, and well-designed protocols and prospective, controlled trials are needed to determine the value of integrating biomarkers into clinical decision making for bladder cancer detection and screening in the future.",Yes
Is signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT3) critical for tumor angiogenesis progression?,Yes,"Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription-3 (STAT3) plays a crucial role in tumor angiogenesis progression. This transcription factor is constitutively activated in diverse human cancers, contributing to tumor cell survival, proliferation, migration, invasion, angiogenesis, and inhibition of apoptosis. STAT3's involvement in angiogenesis is particularly significant, as it promotes the growth of new blood vessels that support tumor growth and metastasis. Numerous studies have demonstrated that STAT3 activation is frequently detected in many cancer types, and its aberrant activation occurs in various human tumors. STAT3 controls cell differentiation, proliferation, and survival, and is associated with angiogenesis and immune dysfunction during tumorigenesis. Furthermore, STAT3's role in tumor-promoting inflammation and suppression of the antitumor host immune response in the tumor microenvironment highlights its critical involvement in cancer progression. While STAT3 is not absolutely required for tumor formation, its persistent activation in many tumors makes them dependent on its expression for their survival, underscoring its potential as a therapeutic target for cancer therapy.",Yes
Is sumoylation implicated in myogenesis?,Yes,"Sumoylation is implicated in myogenesis, as it plays a dual role in regulating the activity of histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) during myogenesis. Basal sumoylation of HDAC1 enhances its deacetylation of myogenic differentiation 1 (MyoD) in undifferentiated myoblasts, while further sumoylation of HDAC1 leads to the dissociation of HDAC1 from MyoD and the binding of HDAC1 to retinoblastoma protein (Rb) to induce myocyte differentiation. This regulatory mechanism is essential for ordered diverse cellular processes during myogenesis.",Yes
Is the Miller-Fisher syndrome considered to be a variant of Guillain-BarrÃ©?,Yes,"The Miller-Fisher Syndrome (MFS) is indeed considered a variant of Guillain-BarrÃ© Syndrome (GBS). Both conditions are acute inflammatory polyradiculoneuropathies, with MFS characterized by the clinical triad of ataxia, areflexia, and ophthalmoplegia. MFS is generally recognized as a localized variant of GBS, with a geographically variable incidence. It is important to note that controversy exists concerning whether MFS is the result of a predominantly axonal or demyelinating polyneuropathy, and whether the GBS variant of acute ataxia and areflexia without ophthalmoplegia has a distinct pathophysiology. Nevertheless, MFS is widely accepted as a variant of GBS, with a reported incidence of approximately 1-5% of all GBS cases in Western countries.",Yes
Is Ctf4 involved in sister chromatid cohesion establishment?,Yes,"Ctf4, a conserved protein, is involved in the establishment of sister chromatid cohesion. Its role is particularly evident during DNA replication, where it functions as a component of the replication fork. Ctf4's contribution to sister chromatid cohesion is demonstrated by its requirement for efficient cohesion in unperturbed mitotic cells, alongside ctf8 and a helicase encoded by chl1. The involvement of Ctf4 in sister chromatid cohesion is further supported by its essential role in cohesion between sister centromeres during meiosis. The exact mechanisms by which Ctf4 contributes to cohesion remain an area of ongoing research, but its role in this process is undoubtedly significant.",Yes
Are retroviruses used for gene therapy?,Yes,"Retroviruses are extensively used for gene therapy due to their unique ability to integrate therapeutic genes into the host genome. Recombinant retroviruses, which have been modified to carry and deliver exogenous genes, are widely employed as gene delivery vehicles in eukaryotic cells. These vehicles exhibit significant potential for human gene therapy and are the most frequently used vehicles in clinical gene therapy trials. Retroviral vectors are one of the most promising vehicles for the delivery of therapeutic genes in human gene therapy protocols, particularly for gene transfer into dividing cells both in vitro and in vivo. Various modifications have been made to retroviral-based vectors and helper cells to improve their efficiency, target delivery, viral titers, and safety. However, the use of retroviral vectors derived from murine oncoretroviruses for gene therapy is associated with the risk of malignant transformation of infected cells and ectopic expression of the proteins of interest. Despite these risks, retroviruses and adenoviruses are among the most commonly used viral vectors in trials, and processes for large-scale manufacturing of recombinant retroviruses that can produce high gene transfer efficiencies will have a significant impact on the clinical implementation of gene therapy.",Yes
Do lincRNAs play a role in human cancer?,Yes,"Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been identified as crucial regulators in various human cancers, including colorectal cancer (CRC) and lung cancer. LncRNAs, such as linc00858, linc01194, linc00052, and linc00520, have been found to be dysregulated in human cancers and function as potential oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes. LncRNAs have been demonstrated to mediate carcinogenesis by promoting cell proliferation, invasion, migration, angiogenesis, and tumor growth. The dysregulation of lncRNAs has been shown to be involved in the initiation and progression of cancer. In CRC, linc00265 has been identified as a potential regulator of carcinogenesis, while linc00858 has been found to act as a tumor-promoting lncRNA by upregulating HNF4Î± and downregulating WNK2. These findings suggest that lncRNAs play a significant role in human cancer development and progression.",Yes
Is there a phylogenetic analysis for HIV?,Yes,"Phylogenetic analysis is extensively employed in HIV research to comprehend the genetic relatedness between HIV strains. This methodology is valuable in understanding the transmission dynamics and epidemiological patterns of HIV. Phylogenetic methods, such as Fitch-Margoliash, Neighbor-Joining, and Maximum Likelihood, are utilized to reconstruct molecular trees from HIV DNA sequences. These trees help in tracking who-infected-whom, when, and how the virus spreads. Phylogenetic analyses have also been used in criminal prosecutions as evidence of responsibility for HIV transmission. The accuracy of these methods justifies their use in HIV-1 research and argues against convergent evolution and selective transmission of certain virus variants.",Yes
Are there randomised controlled trials on sevoflurane?,Yes,"Justification: The context describes several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving sevoflurane. For instance, a double-blinded, prospective RCT was performed to compare intubating conditions facilitated by succinylcholine or sevoflurane. Additionally, major databases were systematically searched for RCTs comparing volatile anesthetics (isoflurane versus sevoflurane) in cardiac surgery. Furthermore, a study retrospectively evaluated pooled renal laboratory data from 22 different clinical trials that compared sevoflurane with three widely used anesthetics. These examples indicate that there are indeed randomized controlled trials on sevoflurane.",Yes
Can FOXOs modulate longevity?,Yes,"FOXO transcription factors have been identified as central regulators of lifespan across various species, including humans. In particular, FOXO3 has been consistently associated with human longevity, with specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) linked to reaching an age above 100 years. The longevity-promoting effect of the FOXO3 genotype is thought to be due, in part, to reduced telomere attrition. FOXO3 is also recognized as a ""master"" gene in aging, as its association with longevity has been replicated in multiple organisms and human populations. Additionally, FOXO transcription factors are involved in the regulation of insulin and insulin-like growth factor signaling, which are known to play a role in longevity. Overall, the evidence suggests that FOXOs can indeed modulate longevity.",Yes
Is there an association between FGFR3 mutation and plagiocephaly?,No,"The context does not provide direct evidence to support an association between FGFR3 mutation and plagiocephaly. Specifically, it is mentioned that none of the 6 patients with nonsynostotic plagiocephaly and none of the 4 patients with additional suture synostosis had the FGFR3 mutation. However, the context does establish a clear association between FGFR3 mutations and various human skeletal dysplasias, including craniosynostosis syndromes. The c749g (pro250arg) mutation in the FGFR3 gene has been found in patients with different types of craniosynostosis, and many patients with a clinical diagnosis of ""nonsyndromic"" coronal craniosynostosis have been found to be heterozygous for the FGFR3 mutation pro250arg. Nonetheless, the absence of the FGFR3 mutation in patients with nonsynostotic plagiocephaly suggests that this specific mutation is not directly associated with plagiocephaly.",Yes
Are CD44 variants (CD44v) associated with poor prognosis of metastasis?,Yes,"Justification: The expression of variant isoforms of CD44, denoted as CD44v, has been shown to correlate with metastatic potential in various carcinomas. These CD44v expressions are associated with poor prognosis in hematological malignancies and human squamous cell cancers. The specific CD44v3 expression significantly correlates with histologic grade and lymph node metastasis. Notably, the serum level of CD44v6 molecule is higher in patients with lymph node metastasis compared to other patients, indicating its role in tumor progression. Patients suffering from tumors expressing CD44v6 have a poorer relapse-free and overall survival. The aberrant expression of CD44 has been detected in human tumors and is associated with metastasis and poor prognosis in human malignancies. The presence or absence of CD44v expression may be related to the high or low metastatic potential of human malignancies.",Yes
Is Bladder training an effective method to treat  urge incontinence ?,Yes,"Bladder training, a behavioral intervention involving gradual extension of the interval between voluntary voidings, has been reported as an effective therapy for urge urinary incontinence. This method has been widely used for treating mild to moderate forms of urinary incontinence in outpatient populations, demonstrating significant reduction in incontinence among older, community-dwelling women. Various behavioral interventions, including biofeedback for pelvic floor muscle control, verbal feedback, and self-help booklets, have shown comparable improvements in urge incontinence. Although few patients are cured with either behavioral or drug therapies alone, bladder training is a successful non-invasive technique devoid of complications and recommended for the treatment of mild detrusor instability. Inpatient bladder retraining has also been confirmed as a useful treatment option, especially for those who are refractory to outpatient management.",Yes
Do proton pump inhibitors affect thyroxine absorption?,Yes,"Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) have been observed to affect thyroxine absorption. The context indicates that the aim of a study was to assess the effect of concomitant use of levothyroxine (LT4) and PPIs on thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels in patients with primary hypothyroidism. Thyroxine absorption takes place at the small intestine level, and several disorders affecting this intestinal tract can lead to thyroxine malabsorption. It is believed that gastric pH interferes in levothyroxine absorption. Furthermore, medications may sometimes interfere with the intestinal absorption of levothyroxine, primarily by forming an insoluble complex with the thyroid hormone in the intestinal lumen. Thus, it can be inferred that PPIs may affect thyroxine absorption, potentially leading to altered TSH levels in patients with hypothyroidism.",No
Is PER3 required for CHK2 activation in human cells?,No,"The context does not provide evidence to suggest that PER3 is required for CHK2 activation in human cells. Instead, the context focuses on the activation mechanisms of pctk3 (also known as ERK3) by cyclin A2 and PKA, the role of CHK in trka receptor signaling, and the identification of MK5 as a downstream target of ERK3. The context does not mention PER3 or its potential role in CHK2 activation. Therefore, based solely on the provided context, it cannot be concluded that PER3 is required for CHK2 activation in human cells.",Yes
Are there any clinical trials of the effect of evening primrose oil on postmenopausal symptoms ?,Yes,"There is evidence of clinical trials investigating the effects of evening primrose oil on postmenopausal symptoms. One such study aimed to evaluate the effects of phytoestrogen supplements on the quality of life of postmenopausal women, which could include evening primrose oil. Additionally, a pilot study demonstrated the benefits of pumpkin seed oil for postmenopausal women, providing strong evidence to support further studies. Although not specifically focused on evening primrose oil, these studies suggest that research has been conducted on the potential benefits of phytoestrogen supplements for postmenopausal women.",Yes
Is acid alpha-glucosidase the enzyme that causes Pompe disease when mutant?,No,"Justification: Pompe disease is caused by mutations in the acid alpha-glucosidase (gaa) gene, which leads to deficient activity of the acid alpha-glucosidase enzyme. The enzyme itself does not cause Pompe disease, but its deficiency due to genetic mutations results in the accumulation of glycogen in lysosomes, leading to the manifestation of Pompe disease symptoms. The deficiency of acid alpha-glucosidase enzyme activity is a hallmark of Pompe disease and is used for diagnostic purposes. However, it is the mutations in the gaa gene that cause the disorder, not the enzyme itself.",Yes
Is the optogenetics tool ChR2 light-sensitive?,Yes,"Justification: Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2), a light-gated ion channel, is a widely used optogenetic tool that enables the manipulation of neuronal activity by light. ChR2 is specifically sensitive to wavelengths less than 550 nm, and photocurrents can be elicited in cells stably expressing ChR2 at stimuli ranging from 400-550 nm. The light-sensitivity of ChR2 is due to its ability to undergo a conformational change upon absorption of light, leading to the opening of the ion channel and the influx of cations into the cell. This light-mediated manipulation of electrical activity in excitable cells has enabled the study of neural circuits and the behavior of whole organisms. The discovery of ChR2 has set the stage for the novel field of optogenetics, where cellular processes are controlled by light.",No
Is the Prostate- Specific Antigen (PSA) test relevant only for prostate cancer?,No,"The Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) test is not exclusively relevant for prostate cancer. PSA is a protein produced by prostate cells and is primarily used as a biomarker for prostate cancer. However, elevated PSA levels can also be indicative of non-cancerous conditions such as benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) or prostatitis. Therefore, while PSA testing is a valuable tool in the detection and management of prostate cancer, it is not specific to cancer and can be influenced by other prostate conditions. It is also important to note that a normal PSA level does not definitively rule out the presence of prostate cancer, as some prostate cancers may not produce significant amounts of PSA. Ultimately, a definitive diagnosis of prostate cancer requires a biopsy.",Yes
Is autism one of the characteristics of Moebius syndrome?,Yes,"Justification: The examination of seventeen children and young adults with Moebius syndrome has revealed a high frequency of autistic symptoms. This could suggest a common underlying neurobiological deficit at the brainstem level. Previous studies have also suggested a strong association between Moebius sequence and Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs). However, it is important to note that while there is a correlation, autism is not a definitive characteristic of Moebius syndrome. Each case can vary greatly in severity and symptoms. Further research is needed to fully understand the relationship between Moebius syndrome and autism.",No
Is Sarcolipin a regulatory/inhibitory protein of the Calcium ATPase SERCA?,Yes,"Sarcolipin is a regulatory protein of the Calcium ATPase SERCA. It is a single-spanning membrane protein that regulates the activity of SERCA1A by decreasing its Ca2+ transport rate. Sarcolipin inhibits the cardiac Sarco(Endo)Plasmic Reticulum Ca(2+) ATPase (SERCA2A) by direct binding and is superinhibitory if it binds through Phospholamban (PLN). Furthermore, Sarcolipin is a key regulator of Sarco(Endo)Plasmic Reticulum (SR) Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA) and its expression is altered in diseased atrial myocardium. The highly conserved C-terminal region of Sarcolipin helps to target the protein to the Sarcoplasmic Reticulum membrane and may also participate in the regulatory interaction between Sarcolipin and SERCA. Therefore, Sarcolipin plays a crucial role in maintaining Ca2+ homeostasis by regulating the activity of SERCA.",Yes
Is the circadian clock involved in ribosome biogenesis?,Yes,"The circadian clock plays a role in ribosome biogenesis, as evidenced by the discovery of its involvement in the regulation of protein synthesis and the coordination of mRNA metabolism and translation. The key circadian transcription factor BMAL1 has been found to associate with the translational machinery in the cytosol and promote protein synthesis. Furthermore, the circadian clock regulates the formation of cytoplasmic processing (P) bodies, which control the fate of mRNAs. The results of ribosome profiling experiments in a human cell model for an autonomous clock have also revealed extensive rhythms in ribosome occupancy and daily changes in translation efficiency for a core set of mRNAs. These findings suggest that the circadian clock is involved in the regulation of ribosome biogenesis and protein synthesis.",No
Can mutations in Calmodulin cause ventricular fibrillation?,Yes,"Mutations in Calmodulin (CAM) can indeed cause ventricular fibrillation. CAM is a calcium-sensing protein that plays a crucial role in regulating cardiac ion channels, including the voltage-gated Ca2+ channel CAV 1.2 and the ryanodine receptor (RYR2). Mutations in CAM can interfere with the function of these ion channels, leading to arrhythmias such as catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) and long QT syndrome (LQTS). Moreover, a novel CAM mutation (CAM(F90L)) has been identified in a family with idiopathic ventricular fibrillation (IVF) and early onset sudden cardiac death. This suggests that CAM dysfunction can be a key driver of ventricular fibrillation.",Yes
Is rivaroxaban metabolized in kidneys?,No,"Rivaroxaban, a novel factor 10a inhibitor, undergoes dual mode of elimination in humans. Two-thirds of the drug is metabolized by the liver, while one-third is renally excreted unchanged. The renal clearance of rivaroxaban exceeds the glomerular filtration rate, suggesting that active secretion by efflux transporters, such as p-glycoprotein (mdr1) and breast cancer resistance protein (bcrp), contributes to its clearance. The renal elimination of rivaroxaban is influenced by basolateral organic anion transporter 3 (oat3)-mediated proximal tubular uptake and apical p-glycoprotein (p-gp)-mediated efflux. Therefore, while rivaroxaban is cleared via the kidneys, it is not metabolized in the kidneys.",Yes
Is Hirschsprung disease one of the characteristics of the Mowat-Wilson syndrome?,Yes,"Hirschsprung disease is a characteristic feature of Mowat-Wilson syndrome. This syndrome is a rare genetic disorder caused by mutations or deletions in the ZEB2 gene, also known as the ZFHX1B gene. Hirschsprung disease, a severe condition characterized by the absence of ganglion cells in the colon, is present in approximately 45% of patients diagnosed with Mowat-Wilson syndrome. The prevalence of Hirschsprung disease in association with Mowat-Wilson syndrome ranges from 43 to 57%. Other characteristics of Mowat-Wilson syndrome include intellectual disability, distinctive facial features, congenital heart defects, genitourinary anomalies, and various structural brain anomalies.",No
Is PLK2 involved in alpha-synuclein phosphorylation in the nervous system?,Yes,"The context suggests that Polo-like kinase 2 (PLK2) is a serine/threonine kinase that is responsible for phosphorylating alpha-synuclein (Î±-syn) at serine-129 (ser-129) in Parkinson's disease (PD). The data reveal a functional interaction between Î±-syn and protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), which leads to PP2A activation and underscores a key role for Î±-syn in protein phosphorylation. The kinase responsible for Î±-syn ser-129 phosphorylation is constitutively active in SH-SY5Y cells and involves casein kinase 2 activity. Inhibition of PP2A dramatically increased ser-40 phosphorylation only in Î±-syn overexpressors, in which Î±-syn was also found to co-immunoprecipitate with PP2A. These findings provide novel mechanistic insight into the role of phosphorylation at ser-87 and ser-129 in the pathogenesis of synucleinopathies and potential roles of phosphorylation in Î±-syn normal biology. Therefore, it can be concluded that PLK2 is involved in Î±-syn phosphorylation in the nervous system.",Yes
Is insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) able to affect tendon protein synthesis in classic Ehlers-Danlos syndrome patients?,Yes,"Insulin-like Growth Factor-I (IGF-I) is known to exert an anabolic effect on tendon fibroblast production of collagen, stimulating collagen production by fibroblasts and increasing cell proliferation and collagen content in IGF-I treated tendons compared to controls. Recombinant human IGF-I has been shown to stimulate matrix and DNA synthesis of all tendon segments in a dose-dependent manner. In both young and old men, local IGF-I stimulated tendon protein synthesis, despite lower systemic IGF-I levels in the old group. These findings suggest that IGF-I is able to affect tendon protein synthesis, and, therefore, it may also have the potential to influence tendon repair in classic Ehlers-Danlos syndrome patients. However, further research is needed to confirm this hypothesis and determine the specific effects of IGF-I on tendon protein synthesis in this patient population.",Yes
Does GC content vary markedly within a given isochore?,Yes,"GC content does indeed vary within a given isochore. While isochores are generally defined as regions with relatively homogeneous GC content, recent studies have shown that there can be significant variation within these regions. This variation is influenced by several factors, including mutation biases, recombination rates, and environmental parameters. Different window sizes used in genomic analysis can also reveal different patterns of GC content distribution within the same isochore. The degree of this variation can be quantified using measures such as gcvar, which reflects the intra-genomic GC content variability with respect to the average GC content of the total genome.",Yes
Is tubulin acetylation involved in cell motility?,Yes,"Tubulin acetylation is indeed involved in cell motility. Tubulin, as a key component of microtubules, plays a crucial role in maintaining cell shape and facilitating cell movement. The acetylation of tubulin, specifically at lysine 40 of Î±-tubulin, has been found to modulate microtubule dynamics and functions. This post-translational modification is unique as it is located on the luminal surface of microtubules, away from the interaction sites of most motors. The enzyme Î±TAT1, a tubulin acetyltransferase, interacts with the outside of the microtubule, at least partly through the tubulin C-termini. The acetylation of Î±-tubulin by Î±TAT1 has been implicated in various cellular functions, including intracellular transport and cell motility. Furthermore, the reversible nature of this acetylation suggests its role in modulating microtubule structures and functions, which may subsequently involve in cellular motility.",Yes
Can PLN mutations lead to dilated cardiomyopathy?,Yes,"Phospholamban (PLN) mutations have been associated with primary cardiomyopathies, specifically dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). DCM is characterized by ventricular dilation and systolic dysfunction, which can be caused by mutations in the PLN gene. PLN is a key regulator of sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) and cardiac function, and its mutations in humans have been linked to DCM. Molecular modeling studies have suggested that certain PLN mutations, such as R9L and R9H, may affect the region involved in protein kinase A docking and modulate the release of phosphorylated PLN from the substrate binding site. However, it is important to note that PLN mutations are a rare cause of heart failure and are present almost exclusively in patients with DCM etiology. Additionally, other genetic and environmental factors may also contribute to the development of DCM.",No
Is corpus callosum involved in the MowatâWilson syndrome?,Insufficient,"Information

The involvement of the corpus callosum in Mowat-Wilson syndrome cannot be definitively determined based on the provided context. The context discusses various neurological conditions and their associations with corpus callosum abnormalities, such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and Wilson's disease. However, it does not provide any information regarding the Mowat-Wilson syndrome. Further research is required to establish a connection between the corpus callosum and Mowat-Wilson syndrome.",Yes
Can NXY-059 be used for treatment of acute ischemic stroke patients?,Yes,", with limitations.

NXY-059, a free radical-trapping neuroprotectant, has been shown to significantly reduce disability and improve the primary outcome of reduced disability at 90 days when administered within 6 hours after the onset of acute ischemic stroke. However, it did not significantly improve other outcome measures, including neurologic functioning as measured by the NIHSS score. The compound is well tolerated in patients with acute stroke, and its effect on hemostasis may be important when treating stroke patients. While NXY-059 has demonstrated neuroprotective efficacy in animal models and in human trials, additional research is needed to confirm its benefits in ischemic stroke and to determine optimal dosing strategies.",Yes
Is flibanserin effetive for Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder?,Yes,"Flibanserin is a 5-ht(1a) agonist and 5-ht(2a) antagonist that has been shown to increase sexual desire and reduce distress in premenopausal women with hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD). In a double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, women with remitted or mild depression treated with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors or serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors who were not postmenopausal and were experiencing symptoms of HSDD received flibanserin 50 mg at bedtime (qhs) for 2 weeks and up-titrated to 100 mg qhs, flibanserin 100 mg qhs for the entire treatment period, or placebo for up to 12 weeks. Flibanserin has been shown to cause statistically significant increases in the number of satisfying sexual events and in sexual desire scores on standardized/validated measures while reducing HSDD-related distress of premenopausal women diagnosed with HSDD. In premenopausal women with HSDD, flibanserin 100 mg qhs resulted in significant improvements in the number of SSE and sexual desire (FSFI desire domain score) vs. placebo.",No
Is recommended the use of perioperative treatment with thyroid hormone therapy in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting?,Yes,", with caveats

The available evidence indicates that perioperative oral thyroid hormone can significantly attenuate the postoperative decline in serum hormone levels and improve postoperative hemodynamic and prognostic parameters in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). However, it is important to note that there is conflicting evidence regarding the usefulness of prophylactic perioperative thyroxine/triiodothyronine therapy as an inotropic adjunct in adult patients undergoing routine cardiac surgery. While some studies report improved hemodynamic parameters in the immediate post-bypass period, there is no evidence that its use influences postoperative morbidity, mortality, or length of stay in the elective patient. Therefore, the decision to use perioperative thyroid hormone therapy in patients undergoing CABG should be made on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the individual patient's clinical status and the potential benefits and risks of such therapy.",Yes
Is protein CXCR4 used as a prognostic marker of cancer?,Yes,"Protein CXCR4 has been identified as a potential prognostic marker in various types of cancer. Its high expression has been associated with poor prognosis in breast cancer, gastric cancer, and clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). In gastric cancer, CXCR4 expression was found to be an independent factor of overall survival and cancer-specific survival. Similarly, in ccRCC, high CXCR4 expression was significantly associated with poor progression-free survival. Furthermore, CXCR4 has been suggested as a potential biomarker for liver metastasis and an independent marker for survival in colorectal cancer. The noninvasive imaging of CXCR4 has also been proposed to enable the detection and characterization of aggressive cancers with poor outcomes. However, the clinical significance of CXCR4 expression in colorectal cancer remains unclear and requires further investigation. Overall, these findings suggest that CXCR4 may serve as a useful prognostic marker in cancer patients.",Yes
Is transcapillary  albumin escape altered in diabetic patients?,Yes,"Transcapillary albumin escape is indeed altered in diabetic patients. Studies have shown that diabetic patients with elevated urinary albumin excretion rate, indicative of incipient or clinical nephropathy, exhibit an increased transcapillary escape rate of albumin. This phenomenon is observed even in patients with a modest increase in albuminuria. The transcapillary escape rate of albumin is often elevated in patients with diabetic microangiopathy. Moreover, the enhanced albumin passage through the microvasculature in long-term type 1 diabetic patients with clinical microangiopathy is pressure-dependent to a large extent. The increased leak of albumin is not explained by differences in diabetes duration, blood pressure, or metabolic control at the time of investigation, but is independently related to the presence of microalbuminuria and mean historical HbA1c.",Yes
Are conserved noncoding elements associated with developmental genes?,Yes,"Justification: Conserved noncoding elements (CNEs) have been found to be abundant in vertebrate genomes and are often clustered in the vicinity of developmentally regulated genes. These elements are hypothesized to correspond to cis-regulatory modules, as they have been shown to induce tissue-specific expression patterns. CNEs are also associated with genes that coordinate development and have been proposed to act as transcriptional enhancers. Furthermore, comparative analyses of various mammalian genomes have identified numerous conserved non-coding DNA elements that display striking conservation among species, suggesting that they have maintained specific functions throughout evolution. The fact that CNEs are frequently found near developmental genes, particularly transcription factors, implies that these elements have essential regulatory roles in development.",Yes
Is myasthenia gravis associated with osteoporosis?,Yes,"Myasthenia gravis (MG) is associated with osteoporosis, as evidenced by the lower bone mineral density (BMD) observed in MG patients compared to controls. This association is likely due to several factors, including reduced muscle strength, elevated bone resorption markers, vitamin D deficiency, and increased parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels in MG patients. Additionally, MG is classified as an inflammatory myopathy, and such myopathies have been found to carry significantly elevated risks for osteoporosis and fractures. The prevalence of osteoporosis in MG patients is higher than in healthy controls, further supporting the association between MG and osteoporosis.",Yes
Does a selective sweep increase genetic variation?,No,"A selective sweep does not increase genetic variation. Instead, it leads to a reduction in variation at the selected site and neighboring regions due to genetic hitchhiking. In a hard selective sweep, a single adaptive haplotype rises to high population frequency, while in a soft sweep, multiple adaptive haplotypes sweep through the population simultaneously. Both scenarios result in distinct patterns of genetic variation in the vicinity of the selected site, characterized by decreased variation and departure from selective neutrality in haplotype tests. This process is driven by positive selection, which increases the frequency of a variant from low to high in a population, underlying some long-studied human characteristics such as variation in skin, hair, or eye color.",No
Is indicated the use of antioxidant supplements in patients at risk for coronary artery disease?,Yes,"The use of antioxidant supplements in patients at risk for coronary artery disease (CAD) may be indicated, as some evidence suggests that antioxidant therapy could be beneficial for preventing coronary heart disease (CHD). Observational studies have shown that people with high intake of antioxidant vitamins, either through regular diet or as food supplements, generally have a lower risk of myocardial infarction and stroke compared to those who consume low amounts of antioxidant vitamins. Antioxidant vitamins are thought to play a role in atherosclerosis, and foods rich in antioxidants have been associated with a reduced risk of myocardial infarction. Epidemiologic studies have found lower CHD morbidity and mortality in persons who consume larger quantities of antioxidants in foods or supplements. However, it is important to note that the results of clinical trials have been inconsistent, and some studies suggest that antioxidant supplements might have harmful as well as beneficial effects in the setting of cardiovascular disease. Therefore, further research is needed to fully understand the potential benefits and risks of antioxidant supplementation in patients at risk for CAD.",No
Is there evidence to suggest that triiodothyronine has neuroprotective properties in traumatic brain injury?,Yes,"Evidence suggests that triiodothyronine (T3) has neuroprotective properties in traumatic brain injury (TBI). Treatment with T3 has been shown to ameliorate the progression of neurological deficits in mice subjected to TBI. Thyroid hormone, including T3, plays a crucial role in neurodevelopment and adult brain function, and may influence neuronal recovery after TBI. In vitro and in vivo studies have supported the role of thyroid hormone in activating pathways important for neuronal protection and promotion of neuronal recovery after injury. T3 has also been demonstrated to possess neuroprotective and anti-edema activity in pre-stroke treatment regimens when administered as a solution or as a nanoparticle formulation. Furthermore, T3 has been found to exert an antidepressant-like effect in various psychopharmacological tests in rodents. These findings suggest that T3 may have a therapeutic potential in the treatment of TBI.",Yes
Is Lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) a critical regulator of hematopoiesis?,Yes,"Lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) is a critical regulator of hematopoiesis. This is supported by its role as an indispensable epigenetic governor of hematopoietic differentiation, where it represses hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) gene expression programs. LSD1 functions as a transcriptional coregulator by modulating histone methylation, specifically targeting mono- or di-methylated histone H3K4 and H3K9, as well as non-histone substrates. Through its demethylase activity, LSD1 plays a pivotal role in a wide range of cellular processes, including the regulation of gene expression as a transcriptional repressor or activator. As the first identified histone demethylase, LSD1 is essential for various biological functions and has been considered a potential therapeutic target in human cancer.",No
Is K-63 linked protein ubiquitination related to proteasomal degradation?,Yes,"The role of K-63 linked protein ubiquitination in proteasomal degradation is supported by recent findings. K-63 ubiquitylation has been identified as playing a critical role in proteasome-mediated substrate degradation by serving as a ""seed"" for K48/K63 branched ubiquitin chains. This activation enhances the selectivity of the 26S proteasome for ubiquitinated proteins and links their deubiquitination to their degradation. Although K-63 linked polyubiquitination appears to regulate protein activities in a non-proteolytic manner, it has been revealed that K63 chains act as a substrate-specific mark for proteasomal degradation involved in regulating cell fate. However, the role of K-63 ubiquitin chains in targeting proteins for proteasomal degradation is still not fully understood and requires further investigation.",No
Could transcription factors act as cell-cell signalling molecules?,No,"Transcription factors are not known to function as cell-cell signalling molecules. Their primary role is to regulate gene expression by binding to specific DNA sequences and modulating the transcriptional activity of target genes. This process occurs within the nucleus of a single cell, and transcription factors themselves do not typically leave the cell or traverse the extracellular space to transmit signals between cells. Instead, cell-cell signalling is primarily mediated by secreted molecules such as hormones, neurotransmitters, and growth factors, which bind to specific receptors on the surface of target cells and trigger intracellular signalling cascades that ultimately regulate gene expression.",Yes
is pharmacological treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism effective in reducing cardiovascular events?,Yes,"Pharmacological treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism is effective in reducing cardiovascular events. The main purpose of a recent meta-analysis was to assess the clinical relevance of subclinical hypothyroidism treatment based on cardiovascular risk parameters correction. Subclinical hypothyroidism has been associated with dyslipidemia, hypertension, and increased risk of coronary artery disease. Early identification and treatment of patients with subclinical hypothyroidism may lead to a favorable effect on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Furthermore, subclinical hypothyroidism affects diastolic function, and this abnormality may be reversed by L-T4 substitutive therapy. In conclusion, pharmacological treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism is effective in reducing cardiovascular events.",Yes
Could Catecholaminergic Polymorphic Ventricular Tachycardia (CPVT) cause sudden cardiac death?,Yes,"Catecholaminergic Polymorphic Ventricular Tachycardia (CPVT) is a genetic arrhythmogenic disorder characterized by adrenergically induced polymorphic or bidirectional ventricular tachycardia. This disorder can lead to sudden cardiac death, often during high adrenergic tone, such as during exercise or acute emotion. The condition is associated with ventricular fibrillation, a life-threatening arrhythmia that can cause the heart to stop pumping blood effectively. The disorder is also linked to mutations in the cardiac ryanodine receptor gene (RYR2) or calsequestrin 2 gene (CASQ2), which are involved in the regulation of calcium release in heart muscle cells. The triggered activity and sudden cardiac death in affected patients are unmasked by exertion or stress.",No
Are histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors good candidates to control metastasis of solid tumors?,Yes,"Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors are considered promising candidates for controlling metastasis of solid tumors. HDACs play a crucial role in regulating gene expression involved in tumorigenesis and tumor maintenance, making them key targets in cancer therapy. The inhibition of HDACs has been shown to reverse malignant phenotypes, induce cell cycle arrest, trigger cell death, and reduce angiogenesis. These effects contribute to the anti-tumor activity of HDAC inhibitors, which have demonstrated favorable results with low toxicity in clinical investigations. Furthermore, HDACs are epigenetic regulators of chromatin condensation and decondensation, exerting effects on the proliferation and spread of cancer. By targeting the epigenetic regulation of gene expression, HDAC inhibitors hold promise in controlling metastasis of solid tumors.",Yes
Is muscle lim protein (MLP) involved in cardiomyopathies?,Yes,"Muscle Lim Protein (MLP) is indeed involved in cardiomyopathies. MLP, also known as Cysteine and Glycine-Rich Protein 3 (CSRP3), is a key regulator of striated muscle function. Mutations in the human MLP gene are associated with both hypertrophic and dilated cardiomyopathy. MLP serves as a scaffold protein on the actin-based cytoskeleton and is an essential regulator of cardiac muscle development. It has been proposed to be a central player in the pathogenesis of heart muscle disease and a key player in the stretch-sensing response. Mice deficient in MLP have been reported to develop dilated cardiomyopathy, and altered MLP expression is significant for the pathogenesis of human heart failure. Therefore, MLP is a candidate gene for heritable forms of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) in humans.",No
Have 5q35 microdeletions been implicated in Sotos syndrome development?,Yes,"Scientific Explanation: 5q35 microdeletions have been identified as a major cause of Sotos syndrome, a rare genomic disorder characterized by pre- and postnatal overgrowth, intellectual disability, and various clinical features. These microdeletions involve the haploinsufficiency of the nuclear receptor set domain-containing protein 1 (NSD1) gene located on 5q35, leading to the development of Sotos syndrome. Cytogenetic studies have confirmed the presence of 5q35 microdeletions, and NSD1 sequencing analysis has identified intragenic mutations in patients with Sotos syndrome. The syndrome arises from mutations and deletions of the NSD1 gene at 5q35.3, resulting in overgrowth, macrocephaly, distinctive facial features, and developmental delay. Severe mental retardation has been observed in most patients with 5q deletions. Therefore, 5q35 microdeletions have been implicated in the development of Sotos syndrome.",No
Is metabolic syndrome related with cardiovascular disease?,Yes,"Metabolic syndrome is unequivocally related to cardiovascular disease. This complex condition, characterized by a constellation of risk factors including disturbed glucose and insulin metabolism, obesity, abdominal fat distribution, dyslipidemia, and hypertension, has been extensively studied and consistently linked to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. The presence of metabolic syndrome has been positively correlated with cardiovascular risk, with subjects exhibiting a 1.29-fold increased risk compared to those without the syndrome. The association between metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease is so robust that metabolic syndrome is proposed as a predictor for cardiovascular disease. This relationship holds true even when the abnormalities present in the syndrome are mild. Furthermore, metabolic syndrome is not only a risk factor for the development of cardiovascular disease but also contributes to atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and increased mortality from cardiovascular disease in all causes.",Yes
Is there any functional association during viral replication between flaviviridae viral RNA depended RNA polymerase and viral helicase?,Yes,"Evidence suggests a functional association between Flaviviridae viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and viral helicase during viral replication. Flaviviruses encode their own helicases, which are crucial for replication and/or assembly of these viruses. The RNA elements within the flavivirus genome play essential regulatory roles during virus replication. The helicase activity of an enzyme is essential for its role in the assembly of infectious virions. Flavivirus assembles a replication complex, consisting of both viral and host proteins, on the cytoplasmic side of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. This replication complex includes the RdRp and helicase, which are involved in the recruitment of the viral RNA to the site of replication and assembly of the functional viral replicase complex. Therefore, it can be inferred that there is a functional association between the Flaviviridae viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and viral helicase during viral replication.",No
Are defects in recombination repair involved in carcinogenesis?,Yes,"Justification: The context indicates that defects in DNA repair pathways, including mismatch repair, base excision repair, nucleotide excision repair, homologous recombination, nonhomologous endjoining, and translesion synthesis, are associated with cancer susceptibility and carcinogenesis. Among these, homologous recombination is a type of recombination repair that plays a crucial role in maintaining genomic stability by repairing double-stranded DNA breaks. Defects in homologous recombination repair can lead to genetic instability and an increased mutation rate, which are hallmarks of cancer. Therefore, it can be concluded that defects in recombination repair, specifically homologous recombination repair, are involved in carcinogenesis.",No
Are seizures among the neurological symptoms of incontinentia pigmenti?,Yes,"Incontinentia pigmenti is a rare neurocutaneous disorder characterized by a distinctive skin rash and a variety of neurological symptoms, including seizures. Seizures have been observed in children with incontinentia pigmenti, from the neonatal period through the early infantile period. The manifestation of seizures in these patients can range from focalized seizures to generalized seizures. In some cases, seizures have been effectively treated with corticosteroid therapy during the acute phase of central nervous system dysfunction. The pathogenesis of central nervous system disorders in incontinentia pigmenti remains unclear, but vascular abnormalities and inflammatory processes are thought to play a role. Other neurological symptoms associated with incontinentia pigmenti include encephalopathy, mental retardation, and cerebrovascular accidents.",Yes
Is there a genome-wide technique for the detection of R-loop formation?,Yes,"Justification: The context indicates the development and application of genome-wide techniques for the detection of R-loop formation. Specifically, the text mentions the use of a new, highly sensitive, and antibody-independent method called ""MAPR"" to profile native R-loops genome-wide. Additionally, a protocol for a strategy named ""R-ChIP"" is provided for robust capture of R-loops genome-wide. These methods have been employed to identify over 700,000 R-loop peaks in the maize genome and to generate a comprehensive atlas quantifying R-loop patterns in Arabidopsis. Furthermore, DRIP-seq techniques are mentioned as widely used methods to map R-loops genome-wide, providing insights into R-loop biology. These findings suggest the existence and application of genome-wide techniques for the detection of R-loop formation.",Yes
Can bioprinting use human cells?,Yes,"Bioprinting, as a rapidly developing technique for biofabrication, has been widely used in artificial tissue and organ generation. This technology allows for the arrangement of living cells in predetermined three-dimensional architectures, which can be achieved through various types of bioprinters, including inkjet-based bioprinters. These bioprinters have the capability to not only arrange cells but also dispense them with controlled cell numbers, similar to a fluorescence activated cell sorter. The use of bioprinting for building tissues from scratch has brought numerous opportunities for biochemical research, including engineering tissues for therapeutic tissue repair and drug screening. Bioprinting has already been applied to construct functional tissues such as vasculature, muscle, cartilage, and bone. However, the application of bioprinting to regenerative medicine has limitations, due to the restricted choices of bio-ink for cytocompatible cell encapsulation and the integrity of the fabricated structures. Nevertheless, it is believed that such a strategy of bioprinting will provide many opportunities in convenient fabrication of 3D cell-laden constructs for applications in tissue engineering, regenerative medicine, and pharmaceutical screening.",Yes
Is transcription-associated mutagenesis (TAM) related to gene expression levels?,Yes,"Transcription-associated mutagenesis (TAM) is indeed related to gene expression levels. High levels of transcription have been shown to correlate with augmented mutation frequency, suggesting a direct relationship between transcription and mutation rate. This phenomenon has been observed in both human cells and yeast, where increased transcription levels stimulate spontaneous mutation rates. Furthermore, the rate of point mutation in a gene has been demonstrated to increase with the expression level of the gene, as evidenced by comparative genomics studies. However, it is important to note that the relationship between TAM and gene expression levels is complex and can be influenced by various factors, including DNA repair mechanisms and the activity of transcription factors.",No
Is there a pharmacogenetic test for trastuzumab?,Yes,"Pharmacogenetic testing, which evaluates patient DNA to determine drug efficacy and potential adverse effects, has been employed in the context of trastuzumab therapy. This personalized approach to medicine aims to identify genetic variants that may affect the efficiency of trastuzumab in cell culture and contribute to trastuzumab resistance. Furthermore, extensive pharmacogenomic testing is required for the administration of certain anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies, such as cetuximab. In the case of trastuzumab, a locus on chromosome 6q12 has been associated with trastuzumab-induced cardiotoxicity. Although there is little data on the impact of pharmacogenetic test results on patient and clinician choice of therapy, the potential of pharmacogenetic testing in tailoring therapy to patients based on their genotype holds significant promise.",Yes
Do carmustine wafers improve survival of glioblastoma patients?,Yes,"Carmustine wafers have been shown to prolong survival in patients with newly diagnosed and recurrent malignant glioma, including glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Locally delivered chemotherapy in the form of biodegradable implants, carmustine wafers confer a survival benefit to patients with GBM following surgical resection. This has been demonstrated across several randomized clinical trials, as well as prospective and retrospective studies. Carmustine wafer implantation during surgery has been shown to be an effective therapeutic adjunct to the standard combined radio-chemotherapy regimen using temozolomide in newly diagnosed and recurrent high-grade glioma patient management. Furthermore, carmustine wafer implantation in combination with maximal resection, followed by standard combined chemoradiotherapy is safe, efficient, and well-tolerated in newly diagnosed supratentorial glioblastomas in adults. In conclusion, carmustine wafers have been shown to improve survival of glioblastoma patients.",Yes
Is Dicer part of the RISC loading complex?,Yes,"Dicer is indeed a part of the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) loading complex. Dicer, a specialized ribonuclease, is responsible for processing double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) into small RNA fragments, which are approximately 25 nucleotides in length, during the initiation phase of RNA interference (RNAi). The processed RNA fragments are then loaded onto the RISC complex, which is responsible for targeting and silencing specific mRNAs. The RISC-loading complex is a multi-protein complex that includes Dicer, along with other proteins such as Argonaute and TRBP. The structure of Dicer, combined with published biochemical data, has been used to propose a model for the architecture of the RISC-loading complex. Furthermore, recent evidence has shown that Drosophila Dicer-1 and Dicer-2 are components of siRNA-dependent RISC (siRISC), further supporting the role of Dicer in the RISC-loading complex.",Yes
Is hypersensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents a hallmark of Fanconi anemia?,Yes,"Hypersensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents is indeed a hallmark of Fanconi anemia. This genetic disorder is characterized by a marked cellular hypersensitivity to DNA interstrand cross-linking agents, which correlates with a defect in the ability to repair this type of damage. The cells from individuals with Fanconi anemia are unusually sensitive to agents that are capable of crosslinking DNA. This hypersensitivity is a result of the inability of Fanconi anemia proteins to effectively repair DNA lesions induced by these agents. The exact molecular mechanism underlying this defect is not yet fully understood, but it is clear that the Fanconi anemia pathway is required for the repair of DNA interstrand cross-links. Therefore, hypersensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents is a defining feature of Fanconi anemia.",Yes
Have C12orf65 mutations been associated with axonal neuropathy and optic atrophy?,Yes,"C12orf65 mutations have been associated with a spectrum of phenotypes, including early onset optic atrophy and axonal neuropathy. C12orf65 participates in the process of mitochondrial translation and defective mitochondrial function attributed to C12orf65 mutations causes primarily optic atrophy and, less commonly, neurodegenerative syndromes. In seven affected individuals originating from two consanguineous families, novel C12orf65 disease-causing mutations were identified, highlighting the triad of optic atrophy, axonal neuropathy, and spastic paraparesis as its key clinical features. In addition, four family members affected with childhood-onset optic atrophy accompanied by slowly progressive peripheral neuropathy and spastic paraparesis were identified to have a homozygous frameshift mutation in C12orf65. These findings suggest that C12orf65 mutations are indeed associated with axonal neuropathy and optic atrophy.",Yes
Are psammoma bodies characteristic to meningiomas?,Yes,"Justification: Psammoma bodies are laminated, calcified spherites that have been observed to be commonly associated with meningiomas. They are often found within meningocytic whorls in meningiomas, and their presence in conjunction with meningothelial cells can aid in the diagnosis of a meningioma. The examination of psammoma bodies at the ultrastructural level in meningiomas has revealed that they contain type VI collagen and laminin. Furthermore, the presence of abundant psammoma bodies along with meningothelial elements can indicate the presence of a benign meningioma within a teratoma. Therefore, psammoma bodies are characteristic of meningiomas.",No
Is cystatin C or cystatin 3 used as a biomarker of kidney function?,Yes,"Cystatin C is a biomarker of kidney function that has been proposed as a more accurate marker than serum creatinine for assessing renal function. It is a cysteine protease inhibitor that is produced by all nucleated cells and is freely filtered by the glomerulus. Serum cystatin C levels have been shown to correlate well with glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and can provide a more sensitive and specific measure of renal function than serum creatinine. In addition, urinary cystatin C has been proposed as a new biomarker for acute tubular kidney dysfunction and may also indicate chronic tubular dysfunction. Cystatin C has been suggested as a new marker of GFR and has been evaluated for its ability to differentiate chronic kidney disease (CKD) stages. Several studies have shown that mild kidney dysfunction, as measured by cystatin C, is associated with increased risk for cardiovascular disease and mortality. Cystatin C has also been proposed as an alternative marker of renal function for estimated GFR (eGFR) in kidney transplant patients.",No
Can fetal aneuploidy be detected with non-invasive prenatal testing?,Yes,"Non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) can detect fetal aneuploidy by analyzing cell-free fetal DNA circulating in maternal plasma. The NIPT enables the detection of common fetal aneuploidies such as trisomy 21, trisomy 18, trisomy 13, and sex chromosome abnormalities. The purpose of this testing is to detect fetal aneuploidy at chromosomes 13, 18, 21, X, and Y without endangering pregnancy. NIPT uses next-generation sequencing to compare maternal and fetal cell-free DNA ratios for chromosomes of interest to assess chromosomal aneuploidy. Although NIPT is not diagnostic and does not replace invasive testing, it is a major advance in prenatal aneuploidy screening and has superior test characteristics compared to traditional screening methods.",Yes
Is dichlorphenamide effective for periodic paralysis?,Yes,"Dichlorphenamide is an effective treatment for periodic paralysis. In trials involving patients with hypokalaemic periodic paralysis, dichlorphenamide was associated with a significantly lower paralytic attack rate (eightfold) compared to placebo. Similarly, in patients with hyperkalaemic periodic paralysis, the attack rate was lower with dichlorphenamide than placebo, reaching statistical significance in one trial. The efficacy of dichlorphenamide in reducing attack frequency and improving quality of life has been demonstrated in both short-term and long-term studies. Furthermore, dichlorphenamide has been shown to be effective and well-tolerated in adolescents and adults with periodic paralysis.",Yes
Is nivolumab used for treatment of NonâSmall-Cell Lung Cancer?,Yes,"Nivolumab, a monoclonal antibody against the programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) receptor, is indeed used for the treatment of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC). It is an immune checkpoint inhibitor that has been shown to be effective and safe in previously treated patients with advanced NSCLC. Nivolumab has been approved for the treatment of NSCLC and has demonstrated promising efficacy as a second-line or later treatment, and after radiotherapy as an abscopal effect. It offers a superior survival benefit over docetaxel in patients with advanced, previously treated NSCLC. Nivolumab has revolutionized the management of patients with advanced NSCLC and has changed the field of metastatic NSCLC treatment. It is a novel PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor that is effective for treating advanced squamous NSCLC in patients previously treated with platinum-based doublet chemotherapy or alternative first-line agents.",Yes
Does  thyroid hormone receptor beta1 affect insulin secretion?,Yes,"Thyroid hormone receptor beta1 is a subtype of thyroid hormone receptors, which are nuclear receptors that mediate the effects of thyroid hormones. Thyroid hormones have been shown to modulate the immune system, metabolism, and influence insulin secretion. The current knowledge on the actions of thyroid hormones on pancreatic beta cells is limited to the modulation of insulin secretion in response to glucose and beta cell viability by regulation of pro-mitotic and pro-apoptotic factors. The deficit in circulating thyroid hormone levels was followed by a smaller glucose-induced insulin secretion, glucose oxidation rate, and calcium uptake. Therefore, it is reasonable to suggest that thyroid hormone receptor beta1, as a mediator of thyroid hormone action, would also affect insulin secretion. However, further research is needed to fully elucidate the precise mechanism underlying this effect.",No
Does replication timing affect the rate of somatic mutations?,Yes,"Recent studies have confirmed a replication-timing effect on mutation rate. Late replication is associated with an increased mutation rate, indicating that replication timing can impact genomic integrity. Replication timing is a crucial aspect of genome regulation, strongly correlated with chromatin structure, gene expression, DNA repair, and genome evolution. Specifically, point mutations and copy number losses correlate with late replication, while copy number gains and other rearrangements correlate with early replication. The realization that replication timing correlates with important features such as transcription, chromatin structure, and genome evolution, and is misregulated in cancer and aging, has only deepened the fascination. Furthermore, mutation rates in both vertebrates and invertebrates have been shown to vary with generation time. These findings suggest that replication timing does indeed affect the rate of somatic mutations.",Yes
Is NOD1 activated in inflammation?,Yes,"NOD1 is indeed activated in inflammation. Upon recognition of microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs), specifically the iE-DAP motif, NOD1 self-oligomerizes in an ATP-dependent manner. This activation leads to the interaction with the adaptor molecule Receptor-Interacting Protein 2 (RIP2), which propagates innate immune signaling and initiates pro-inflammatory immune responses. NOD1, a pattern recognition receptor (PRR), is involved in detecting bacterial peptidoglycan fragments and other danger signals, and has been linked to inflammatory pathologies. Therefore, it can be concluded that NOD1 is activated during inflammation.",No
Does the histidine-rich Ca-binding protein (HRC) interact with triadin?,Yes,"The histidine-rich Ca-binding protein (HRC) demonstrates a direct interaction with triadin, a transmembrane protein of the junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) in skeletal muscle. This interaction is supported by evidence of HRC binding to triadin on blots, as a function of Ca^2+ concentration. Furthermore, HRC can be isolated as a complex with triadin following equilibrium sucrose-density centrifugation in the presence of millimolar concentrations of Ca^2+. The interaction between HRC and triadin is also influenced by the Ca^2+ sensitivity of their binding. These findings suggest that HRC plays a role in regulating Ca^2+ release during excitation-contraction coupling and contributes to Ca^2+ cycling in the SR.",Yes
Does magnesium sulfate improve outcomes of subarachnoid hemorrhage patients?,Inconclusive,"The effectiveness of magnesium sulfate in improving outcomes of subarachnoid hemorrhage patients remains a topic of ongoing debate. While some studies report trends toward improvement in clinical outcomes and suggest a neuroprotective role for magnesium sulfate, other investigations have not found significant benefits. The evidence regarding the prophylactic use of magnesium sulfate in aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage is not fully supportive. High-dose intravenous magnesium has been shown to reduce cerebral ischemic events by attenuating vasospasm and increasing ischemic tolerance during critical hypoperfusion. However, the results of randomized controlled studies have not yet reached a consensus on whether magnesium sulfate improves outcome in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. Therefore, the question of whether magnesium sulfate improves outcomes of subarachnoid hemorrhage patients remains inconclusive based on the current evidence.",No
Are there plasma membrane receptors for thyroid hormones?,Yes,"Recent studies have identified the presence of membrane receptors for thyroid hormones T4, T3, 3,5-T2, and 3-iodothyronamine, which mediate rapid physiological effects. These receptors are distinct from nuclear T3 receptors and may supplement the regulation of TRH and TRH-like peptides. The nongenomic actions of thyroid hormones are initiated at receptors in the plasma membrane, mitochondria, or cytoplasm. Although the biological effects of thyroid hormones are primarily mediated by nuclear receptors, interactions with plasma membrane receptors are increasingly recognized as important for non-genomic mechanisms. The binding characteristics of thyroxine (T4), triiodothyronine (T3), and reverse T3 (rT3) to rat liver plasma membranes have been examined, providing evidence for the existence of cell surface receptors for thyroid hormones. Additionally, the membrane-bound thyrotropin receptor (TSHR) has been implicated in mediating clinically important direct effects of thyrotropin (TSH) and TSHR antibodies in extra-thyroidal tissues. These findings suggest a modulatory role of thyroid hormones on TSH receptors. In summary, there is evidence supporting the existence of plasma membrane receptors for thyroid hormones, which play a role in mediating the rapid physiological effects of these hormones.",Yes
Does Rad9 interact with Aft1 in S.cerevisiae?,No,"The context provided does not contain any information regarding a direct interaction between Rad9 and Aft1 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Rad9 is primarily involved in DNA damage checkpoint pathways, interacting with and activating Rad53 and Chk1 kinases. While the precise role of Rad9 in nucleotide excision repair (NER) is unclear, its interaction with Aft1 is not mentioned. Aft1 is known to be involved in iron homeostasis and stress response in S. cerevisiae, but a direct link between Rad9 and Aft1 has not been established based on the provided context.",Yes
Are there any desmins present in plants?,No,"In the context provided, there is no mention of desmins, which are intermediate filament proteins found in animal cells, particularly in muscle cells. The context discusses various proteins and genes in plants, such as desiccation-related proteins (drps), defensin-like (defl) genes, dicer-like (dcl) proteins, and dynamin-like proteins. However, none of these proteins are equivalent to desmins. Therefore, based on the given context, it can be concluded that there are no desmins present in plants.",Yes
Are viruses involved in the etiology of human subacute thyroiditis?,Yes,"The etiology of human subacute thyroiditis is frequently associated with viral infections. Various viruses, such as Coxsackie, cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, and adenovirus, have been identified as causative agents in most cases of subacute thyroiditis. The disease is generally believed to be of viral origin and is thought to be induced by viral infection. The presence of viruses in the thyroid has been demonstrated, although their role as active participants or mere bystanders in the development of thyroid diseases is still under investigation. Subacute thyroiditis is an inflammatory disease of the thyroid gland, most likely preceded by a viral infection. While the role of viruses in the pathogenesis of autoimmune thyroid diseases remains controversial, subacute thyroiditis is a self-limited inflammatory disease of presumed viral etiology. Therefore, it can be concluded that viruses are involved in the etiology of human subacute thyroiditis.",No
Is miR-126 involved in heart failure?,Yes,"Justification: The context indicates that various microRNAs (miRNAs) have been implicated in heart failure, including miRNA-24, miRNA-21, and miRNA-124. Although the specific focus of the study is on miR-129-5p, the context also mentions that miR-126 has been reported to serve as a potential biomarker of acute myocardial infarction and has been implicated in the processes of inflammation and angiogenesis. Given that these processes are also involved in heart failure, it can be inferred that miR-126 may also play a role in heart failure, although further studies would be needed to confirm this.",No
Does resveratrol reduce cardiac remodeling?,Yes,"Resveratrol has been shown to reduce cardiac remodeling by attenuating features such as increased systolic blood pressure, left ventricular wet weight, left ventricular wall thickness, diastolic stiffness constant, and decreased cardiac contractility. The anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects of resveratrol contribute to its amelioration of cardiovascular remodeling. Furthermore, resveratrol has been observed to improve cardiac function, alleviate cardiac hypertrophy, oxidative stress, and apoptosis in various animal models. The antioxidant and antiapoptotic effects of resveratrol, along with its anti-inflammatory actions, are responsible for its cardioprotective effects. Resveratrol treatment has also been found to lessen cardiac fibrosis, improve molecular and structural remodeling of the heart, and enhance diastolic function, vascular function, and energy metabolism. These findings suggest that resveratrol can prevent or attenuate adverse changes in the cardiovascular system, including cardiac remodeling.",No
Is oxalate renal excretion increased after bariatric surgery?,Yes,"Evidence suggests that bariatric surgery is associated with an increase in oxalate renal excretion. This is supported by observations of elevated urinary oxalate excretion, plasma oxalate, and urinary calcium oxalate supersaturation values post-surgery. The mean oxaluric response to an oxalate load is markedly elevated in post-bariatric surgery patients, indicating increased intestinal absorption of dietary oxalate as a predisposing mechanism for enteric hyperoxaluria. Studies have shown that urinary oxalate excretion is 4-fold higher in Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) patients compared to sham controls on a moderate oxalate diet. This hyperoxaluria predisposes to nephrolithiasis, with postoperative hyperoxaluria leading to urolithiasis and kidney damage in obese patients. The increasing prevalence of obesity and metabolic syndrome in the past 30 years has also been associated with a significant increase in urinary oxalate.",Yes
Is there a role for transcription factories in genome organization?,Yes,"Transcription factories are proposed to have a significant role in genome organization. They are specialized nuclear domains where gene transcription occurs, and they are implicated in the formation of chromatin loops and the clustering of active and co-regulated genes. It has been suggested that the association of transcribed genes into transcription factories supports the function-dependent three-dimensional organization of the interphase genome. Furthermore, transcription factories are believed to promote chromatin loop formation, enabling the simultaneous transcription of relatively distant genes. The dynamic organization of individual factories allows them to respond to increased transcriptional load by significantly increasing in size. There is also evidence that different factories may specialize in the transcription of different groups of genes. Therefore, transcription factories are considered to have a crucial role in genome organization.",Yes
Is the length of the poly(A) tail involved in human disease?,Yes,"The length of the poly(A) tail is involved in human disease as it plays a critical role in mRNA stability and translation. Alterations in poly(A) tail length can impact an mRNA's function and subsequent physiological impact. Deviations from the canonical length can signal degradation or nuclear retention of transcripts, which can have implications for human disease. Poly(A) tails are important elements in mRNA translation and stability, and their length can be modulated by changes in length. Poly(A) polymerases add the poly(A) tail at the 3' end of nearly all eukaryotic mRNA, and are associated with proliferation and cancer. Therefore, changes in poly(A) tail length can have implications for human disease, particularly in the context of cancer and other proliferative disorders.",Yes
Are patients with marfan syndrome at increased risk of arrhythmias?,Yes,"Patients diagnosed with Marfan Syndrome (MFS) are at an increased risk of developing arrhythmias. The study indicates that MFS is associated with a higher risk of sudden death, and there is a strong link between wall motion abnormalities and arrhythmias in patients with heart failure, hypertension, valvular heart disease, or mitral valve prolapse. Additionally, mitral valve prolapse has been associated with an increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias. While it is controversial whether SCN5A mutation carriers possess a greater risk of major arrhythmic events, the overall evidence suggests that patients with MFS are at an elevated risk of developing arrhythmias.",Yes
Do selenoproteins and selenium play a role in prostate cancer prevention?,Yes,"Selenium and selenoproteins have been implicated in the prevention of prostate cancer, as evidenced by epidemiological and clinical data. Selenium compounds possess chemopreventive effects on prostate cancer, and the dietary trace element selenium has been proposed as a potential chemopreventive agent. Higher serum selenium levels have been associated with lower risks of prostate cancer in men with high vitamin E intake, multivitamin users, and smokers. Furthermore, genetic variants in genes coding for selenoproteins may also play a role in prostate cancer etiology. However, the exact biological effects of selenium on normal or malignant prostate cells are not well known, and the form of selenium and mechanisms underlying its protective effects remain largely unknown.",Yes
Has protein citrullination been implicated in rheumatoid arthritis?,Yes,"Protein citrullination has been implicated in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), as it is a post-translational modification that has attracted significant attention due to its involvement in the pathogenesis of RA. In the inflamed rheumatoid joint, there is increased protein citrullination, which is present in the rheumatoid synovium and contributes to the perpetuation of chronic inflammation. The presence of autoantibodies and autoreactive T cells to citrullinated proteins and citrullinating enzymes in patients with RA, together with the accumulation of citrullinated proteins in rheumatoid joints, provides substantial evidence that dysregulated citrullination is a hallmark feature of RA. Anticitrullinated protein antibodies (ACPA) and citrullinated proteins play key roles in the pathogenesis of RA, and protein citrullination catalyzed by peptidyl arginine deiminase (PADs) is involved in autoimmune disease pathogenesis, particularly in RA. Dysregulated citrullination drives the production and maintenance of antibodies to citrullinated proteins, which are specific markers of RA. However, the molecular mechanisms driving protein citrullination in patients with RA remain poorly understood.",Yes
Do R-loops tend to form at sites of DNA replication?,Yes,"R-loops have been demonstrated to form at sites of DNA replication, specifically when replicative forks collide with the transcriptional machinery. This collision can result in the formation of R-loops, which are composed of an RNA-DNA hybrid and a displaced single-stranded DNA. The presence of R-loops at replication sites can lead to genomic instability and DNA damage, particularly in certain contexts. Additionally, R-loops have been identified as critical regulators of chromatin biology and have been implicated in various cellular processes, including transcription termination, gene regulation, and DNA repair. The location of promoter-associated R-loops has been found to depend on the presence of introns. Overall, R-loops are recognized as non-B DNA structures with significant consequences for gene expression and genome stability.",No
Is selenium deficiency involved in autoimmune thyroid disease?,Yes,"Selenium deficiency is implicated in the pathogenesis of autoimmune thyroid diseases, including Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Selenium, an antioxidant, plays a crucial role in thyroid physiology and immunity. Its deficiency has been associated with increased risk of thyroid disease and higher incidence of thyroiditis in areas with severe selenium deficiency. This is due to decreased activity of selenium-dependent glutathione peroxidase enzyme within thyroid cells. Selenium supplementation has been shown to decrease thyroid autoantibodies in patients with autoimmune thyroiditis and improve the course of thyroid autoimmunity. However, the mechanism underlying this process is not yet fully understood. Despite slightly higher selenium levels in normal persons than in patients with autoimmune thyroid disease, a weak negative correlation between selenium and antithyroid antibodies suggests a potential role of selenium deficiency in autoimmune thyroid disease.",Yes
Is it safe to use Abatacept during pregnancy?,Inconclusive,"Abatacept is a T-cell costimulation inhibitor used to treat autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. The context provided does not specifically mention Abatacept, but it does discuss the use of TNF-alpha antagonists, which are also used to treat autoimmune diseases. The context suggests that TNF-alpha antagonists are presumed to be safe during pregnancy based on animal data, but essential evidence on the safety of their use during pregnancy is lacking. Similarly, the use of azathioprine (aza) in the treatment of autoimmune diseases during pregnancy is believed to be relatively safe, but essential evidence on its safety is also lacking. Given the lack of specific information on Abatacept, it is difficult to make a definitive statement on its safety during pregnancy. Further research is needed to determine the safety and efficacy of Abatacept during pregnancy.",No
Is STAT3 involved in EIF2AK2-dependent suppression of autophagy?,No,"The context suggests that STAT3 contributes to CRPC cell survival and chemoresistance by modulating autophagy. However, it does not directly implicate STAT3 in EIF2AK2-dependent suppression of autophagy. The study reveals that EIF2AK2, also known as EEF2K, is required for autophagy signaling during ER stress, and its phosphorylation at Ser398 is essential for the induction of autophagy. In contrast, phosphorylation of EEF2K at Ser366 and Ser78 exerts an inhibitory effect on autophagy. The context does not provide evidence that STAT3 is involved in the EIF2AK2-dependent suppression of autophagy, as it focuses on the role of STAT3 in modulating autophagy and its contribution to CRPC cell survival and chemoresistance.",Yes
Are CTCF and BORIS involved in genome regulation and cancer?,Yes,"CTCF and BORIS are involved in genome regulation and cancer. Both are multivalent 11-zinc finger transcription factors that play important roles in organizing higher-order chromatin architecture. CTCF is a chromatin regulator with wide-ranging effects on gene regulation, while BORIS is a paralogue of CTCF and a member of the cancer-testis antigen family. BORIS is expressed in early gametogenesis and multiple cancers but not in differentiated somatic cells. It is involved in the regulation of cancer cellular and molecular features, such as self-renewal, chemo-resistance, tumorigenicity, sphere-forming ability, and migration capacity. BORIS also regulates important signaling pathways, including Wnt/Î²-catenin and Notch in cancer stem cells, and recruits transcription factors or chromatin-remodeling proteins to induce tumorigenesis. Unlike CTCF, which has tumor-suppressive properties, BORIS belongs to the ""cancer/testis antigen"" family and is aberrantly activated in a variety of tumors.",Yes
Are Sidekick proteins members of the immunoglobulin superfamily?,Yes,"Justification: Sidekick proteins are indeed members of the immunoglobulin superfamily. The immunoglobulin superfamily is a large group of proteins characterized by their structural similarity to immunoglobulins, possessing at least one immunoglobulin-like domain. Sidekick proteins, encoded by the Sidekick gene, are single-pass transmembrane proteins and are among the largest of the immunoglobulin superfamily membrane proteins. They are known to mediate homophilic adhesion and direct laminar targeting of neurites, which are functions typically associated with immunoglobulin superfamily proteins.",Yes
Is there a relationship between junctin and ryanodine receptors?,Yes,"Junctin, a 26 kDa integral membrane protein, is a significant component of the ryanodine receptor (RyR) Ca^2+^ release channel complex in the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Junctin forms a quaternary complex with RyR, triadin, and calsequestrin at the junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane. This protein is colocalized with RyR and calsequestrin in cardiac and skeletal muscles. Junctin directly binds to RyR and calsequestrin, mediating Ca^2+^-dependent regulatory interactions between these proteins. The absence of junctin alters the response of RyR to luminal Ca^2+^, making junctin-devoid RyR channels less responsive at low luminal Ca^2+^ and hypersensitive at high luminal Ca^2+^ concentrations. Junctin expression affects the packing of calsequestrin in the junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum and facilitates the association of sarcoplasmic reticulum and T tubules. These findings suggest that junctin plays a crucial role in cardiomyocyte Ca^2+^-cycling and contractility, and its physiological role in luminal regulation of RyR Ca^2+^ release is essential for proper cardiac function.",Yes
Have mutations in the ZEB2 gene been found in any human syndrome?,Yes,"Mutations in the ZEB2 gene have indeed been found to be associated with human syndromes. Over 180 distinct mutations have been reported, including nonsense and missense point mutations, deletions, and large chromosomal rearrangements. These mutations have been linked to haploinsufficiency of the ZEB2 gene, located on chromosome 2q22.3. Notably, a partial duplication of the ZEB2 gene has been identified as the cause of Mowat-Wilson Syndrome. This duplication, a novel de novo 69-kb duplication containing exons 1 and 2 of the ZEB2 gene, was identified using chromosomal microarray analysis. The discovery of these mutations and their association with human syndromes has contributed to a better understanding of the genetic basis of these conditions.",Yes
Is JTV519 (K201) a potential drug for the prevention of arrhythmias?,Yes,"JTV519 (K201) is a potential drug for the prevention of arrhythmias. This 1,4-benzothiazepine derivative has been shown to possess anti-arrhythmic and cardioprotective properties in various studies. JTV519 has been demonstrated to significantly decrease the mean number of sustained atrial fibrillation episodes in the canine sterile pericarditis model, indicating its potential as a novel antiarrhythmic agent for atrial fibrillation. The drug acts as a multiple-channel blocker, including as a k+ channel blocker, and inhibits Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, preventing myocardial damage and the induction of arrhythmias during Ca2+ overload. JTV519 has also been shown to have activities indicated for treatment of atrial fibrillation, ventricular fibrillation, heart failure, and ischemic heart disease. Its mechanism of action is complex and controversial, but its efficacy in suppressing arrhythmias and protecting cardiomyocytes from calcium overloading-induced damage has been established.",No
Are the Fanconi anemia genes a part of the same signalling pathway?,Yes,"The Fanconi anemia (FA) genes are part of the same signalling pathway, known as the FA pathway or FA/BRCA pathway. This pathway is involved in DNA repair, specifically in the repair of interstrand crosslinks (ICLs), which are a type of DNA damage. The FA proteins encoded by the FA genes interact with each other and with other proteins involved in DNA repair, forming a complex network that is essential for maintaining genomic stability. The FA pathway is activated in response to DNA damage, and defects in this pathway can lead to genomic instability, bone marrow failure, and an increased susceptibility to cancer, which are hallmarks of Fanconi anemia.",Yes
Are there clinical trials using stem cells for the treatment of cardiac disease?,Yes,"There is a significant body of evidence demonstrating the use of stem cells for the treatment of cardiac disease in clinical trials. These trials have shown promising results, with stem cell therapy emerging as a potentially transformative approach for cardiovascular diseases. In particular, stem cells have been studied for their regenerative potential in improving cardiac performance, promoting cardiac repair, and restoring lost cardiac function. The focus of these trials has been on various types of stem cells, including cardiac stem cells and adult tissue-derived stem cells, with the aim of achieving clinically significant outcomes in stem cell therapies for cardiac repair. The application of stem cell therapy in this context is a rapidly evolving field, with ongoing research and development aimed at facilitating stem cell delivery and promoting their cardiac regenerative activity.",Yes
Is DNA methylation an epigenetic modification of chromatin related to gene expression?,Yes,"DNA methylation is indeed an epigenetic modification of chromatin that plays a crucial role in gene expression regulation. This process involves the addition of a methyl group to the 5' cytosine, which can alter the chromatin structure and ultimately affect the binding of transcription factors. DNA methylation is enriched in heterochromatin, where it contributes to the condensed state of the chromatin and represses gene expression. Conversely, it is depleted at active promoters and enhancers, where it facilitates gene transcription. The methylation status of certain CpG sites close to or within a gene can directly affect its expression, either by silencing or, in some cases, up-regulating transcription. DNA methylation is a chemically reversible modification that is involved in various cellular processes, including embryogenesis, genomic imprinting, X-chromosome inactivation, and genome stability. It is also suggested that DNA methylation alters the mechanical properties of DNA molecules, which is likely to affect epigenetic regulation.",Yes
Is Growth factor independence 1b (GFI1B) important for hematopoiesis?,Yes,"Growth factor independence 1b (GFI1B) is a DNA binding transcriptional repressor with vital functions in hematopoiesis. It is essential for the development and differentiation of erythroid and megakaryocytic lineages. GFI1B coordinates the assembly of transcriptional repressor complexes to control gene expression programs governing lineage allocation in hematopoiesis. GFI1B signaling is important for commitment and maturation of hematopoietic cell populations. GFI1B expression is restricted to erythroid lineage cells and is essential for erythropoiesis. GFI1B is also a master transcriptional repressor of adult erythropoiesis and thrombopoiesis. Overexpression of GFI1B has been observed in leukemic patients and cell lines. Therefore, GFI1B is important for hematopoiesis.",Yes
Has Revlimid been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration?,No,"The provided context does not contain any information regarding the approval status of Revlimid by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Therefore, based on the given context, it cannot be confirmed that Revlimid has been approved by the FDA. Further information would be required to determine the approval status of Revlimid.",Yes
Has single guide RNA been used on human cells?,Yes,"Single guide RNA (sgRNA) has been employed in human cells as a crucial component of the CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing system. This sgRNA guides the Cas9 nuclease to a specific target site in the genome, enabling precise editing of DNA sequences. The use of sgRNA in human cells has been demonstrated in various studies, including those investigating gene knock-down, gene repair, and gene therapy. The context provided supports the use of single-stranded RNA, including sgRNA, in human cells for therapeutic development and functional genomics studies.",No
Is Fibroblast Growth Factor 23 a phosphaturic hormone?,Yes,"Fibroblast Growth Factor 23 (FGF-23) is indeed a phosphaturic hormone. Produced by bone cells, primarily osteoblasts and osteocytes, FGF-23 plays a crucial role in maintaining phosphate homeostasis. It exerts its phosphaturic effects by binding to the Klotho-FGF receptor complex in the kidneys, which subsequently increases urinary phosphate excretion and reduces the synthesis of active vitamin D. This dual action helps to lower serum phosphate levels and maintain a balanced phosphate metabolism. However, the exact mechanisms regulating FGF-23 production and its interactions with other hormones, such as parathyroid hormone, remain an area of ongoing research.",Yes
Is amoxicillin used for treatment of malnutrition in children?,Yes,"Amoxicillin is indeed used for the treatment of malnutrition in children, specifically those with uncomplicated severe acute malnutrition (SAM). Current World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines recommend oral amoxicillin as part of the management of uncomplicated SAM due to the high risk of infectious mortality in these children. Amoxicillin is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that has been evaluated for its role in the nutritional recovery of children with uncomplicated SAM. Despite concerns about increasing antibiotic resistance, amoxicillin remains a first-line drug for the treatment of SAM in children as an outpatient. However, it is important to note that evidence for the efficacy of amoxicillin to improve nutritional recovery or reduce mortality has been mixed, and alternative antibiotics such as azithromycin or ciprofloxacin may have advantages in terms of dosing and administration. Nonetheless, amoxicillin continues to be the drug of first choice for the treatment of acute otitis media in children due to its safety and affordability.",Yes
Is it possible to purify pseudopodia to be used for proteomic analysis?,Yes,"It is indeed possible to purify pseudopodia for proteomic analysis. The described method involves the use of polycarbonate microporous filters to separate pseudopodia from the cell body compartment. This separation is then verified through electron microscopic examination of the respective platelet components. The purified pseudopodia can be scraped from the filter surface into lysis buffer for biochemical analysis. This method has been successful in identifying 46 pseudopodia-localizing proteins, providing insights into the molecular details of pseudopodia. The purification process is a crucial step in subcellular proteomics, allowing for the identification of novel proteins and the study of signaling processes that regulate pseudopodium formation and cell polarity.",Yes
Is  farnesoid X receptor (FXR) a nuclear receptor?,Yes,"The Farnesoid X Receptor (FXR) is indeed a nuclear receptor. It belongs to the nuclear receptor superfamily, a group of ligand-activated transcription factors that regulate gene expression by binding to DNA either as a monomer or a heterodimer with the retinoid X receptor. FXR is highly expressed in various organs, including the liver, kidney, adrenals, and intestine. It is activated by bile acids such as chenodeoxycholic acid and synthetic ligands like GW4064. FXR plays a crucial role in regulating bile acid, lipid, and glucose metabolism, and has recently emerged as a potential therapeutic target.",No
Are DNA helicases involved in progeroid syndromes?,Yes,"DNA helicases are implicated in progeroid syndromes due to their crucial role in genome maintenance. Mutations in helicase genes, such as the WRN helicase gene in Werner Syndrome, lead to defects in DNA repair and transcriptional activation. These defects result in genomic instability and impaired DNA damage repair, which are hallmarks of progeroid syndromes. Furthermore, altered transcription is speculated to play a causative role in aging and is involved in the pathology of most progeroid syndromes. The gene mutated in Werner Syndrome encodes a 3' --> 5' DNA helicase, further supporting the involvement of DNA helicases in progeroid syndromes.",No
Is there association of matrix metalloproteinases with behaviour of pituitary adenomas?,Yes,"Justification: The context suggests that matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) have been studied in relation to the behavior of pituitary adenomas. Specifically, MMP-2 and MMP-9 have been implicated in the aggressiveness and invasion of pituitary adenomas. The expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9, as well as other MMPs and their inhibitors, has been examined in various pituitary adenoma subtypes, including acromegaly, Cushing's disease, prolactinoma, and nonsecreting adenoma. The interrelationship between MMPs and serine proteinases in pituitary adenomas remains to be elucidated, but their involvement in remodeling processes and tumorigenesis suggests a potential role in the behavior of these tumors.",No
Is Vitamin D deficiency in pregnant women associated with gestational diabetes?,Yes,"Vitamin D deficiency in pregnant women is indeed associated with an increased risk of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). This correlation is supported by multiple studies that have found a significantly higher prevalence of vitamin D deficiency among women with GDM compared to non-GDM control subjects. The relationship between vitamin D status and glucose tolerance during pregnancy has been observed, suggesting that vitamin D may influence the development of GDM. Furthermore, evidence indicates that vitamin D supplementation has the potential to promote glycemic control in women with GDM. However, the exact mechanisms underlying this association and the effects of co-administration of vitamin D with other nutrients on pregnancy outcomes in GDM require further investigation.",Yes
Does Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) show a bias for highly expressed loci?,No,"Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) does not inherently show a bias for highly expressed loci. The technique is designed to study interactions between proteins and discrete chromosomal loci in vivo, regardless of their expression levels. ChIP allows for the enrichment of genomic regions associated with specific transcription factors, histone modifications, and other epitopes present on chromatin. It is considered the method of choice for characterizing interactions between a protein of interest and specific genomic regions. The technique can be coupled with high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) or microarray hybridization (ChIP-chip) to allow genome-wide discovery of protein-DNA interactions, such as transcription factor bindings and histone modifications. However, the technique itself does not preferentially target highly expressed loci.",Yes
Is clathrin involved in E-cadherin endocytosis?,Yes,"Clathrin is involved in E-cadherin endocytosis, specifically through the formation and internalization of clathrin-coated membrane buds containing extracellular cargo. In epithelial cells, E-cadherin, a central component of the adherens junction, continuously undergoes endocytosis via clathrin-coated vesicles and/or caveolae. In MDCK cells, E-cadherin is endocytosed solely through SMAP1-regulated clathrin-coated vesicles. Clathrin plays a crucial role in this process as a scaffolding protein underlying the invaginating plasma membrane and surrounding the primary endocytic vesicle. Clathrin-mediated endocytosis is a major regulator of cell-surface protein internalization, including E-cadherin.",Yes
Is Propofol used for short-term sedation?,Yes,"Propofol is indeed used for short-term sedation. It is a short-acting, intravenous sedative-hypnotic agent that is widely used for the induction and maintenance of general anesthesia and sedation. Propofol's pharmacokinetic profile is ideal for conscious sedation due to its rapid onset and short duration of action. It is increasingly being used to provide deep sedation in the endoscopy community with an acceptable safety profile. The recovery from sedation is faster in patients receiving propofol, although this did not reach statistical significance. Propofol has advantages as a sedative agent for endoscopic procedures including rapid onset, short half-life, and rapid recovery time. These characteristics make propofol a suitable choice for short-term sedation.",Yes
Does splicing occur co-transcriptionally?,Yes,"Splicing is a co-transcriptional process, as evidenced by numerous experimental approaches demonstrating that splicing is coupled to transcription in various organisms such as Drosophila, yeast, and mammals. Spliceosome assembly and splicing catalysis have been shown to occur co-transcriptionally, with splicing taking place for the majority of intron-containing genes during RNA synthesis. The functional coupling of transcription and splicing has been reported both in vivo and in vitro, although the molecular mechanisms governing these interactions remain largely unknown. Recent studies indicate that precursor mRNA splicing occurs cotranscriptionally and that nucleosome positioning may influence the inclusion of internal exon sequences. The coupling between transcription and alternative splicing is an important layer of gene expression regulation in plants, with distinct combinations of splicing factors being recruited to sites of alternatively spliced transcripts in intact cells.",Yes
Are there clinical trials on stem cells in multiple sclerosis,Yes,"Justification: Clinical trials on stem cells in multiple sclerosis (MS) are being conducted, focusing on the safety and feasibility of treatment with candidate cell-based therapies. The potential use of transplanted stem cells in the treatment of MS is under investigation, with autologous bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) being examined in clinical trials. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have emerged as a potentially powerful cellular therapy for autoimmune diseases, including MS, with the potential to both ameliorate inflammatory processes and improve regeneration and repair. In a phase I trial, autologous, bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells were isolated from trial participants with MS and culture-expanded for clinical use.",No
Are piRNAs involved in gene silencing?,Yes,"Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) are indeed involved in gene silencing. These small non-coding RNAs, specifically found in the germline, play a crucial role in maintaining genome integrity during germline development by silencing genomic transposable elements. The piRNA-PIWI complexes are transported into the nucleus to exert this silencing effect. Moreover, piRNAs have been found to regulate various endogenous transcripts, further emphasizing their role in gene silencing. This process is a part of the broader RNA silencing pathways, which are essential for cellular functions ranging from the regulation of mRNA turnover to the suppression of potentially deleterious transposable elements.",Yes
Can RG7112 inhibit MDM2?,Yes,"RG7112, a potent and selective member of the nutlin family of MDM2 antagonists, has been shown to bind MDM2 with high affinity (k(d) ~ 11 nmol/l), thereby blocking its interactions with p53 in vitro. This binding occurs within the p53 pocket of MDM2, mimicking the interactions of critical p53 amino acid residues, as revealed by a crystal structure of the RG7112-MDM2 complex. Oral administration of RG7112 to human xenograft-bearing mice at nontoxic concentrations has resulted in dose-dependent changes in proliferation/apoptosis biomarkers, as well as tumor inhibition and regression. These findings offer a preclinical proof-of-concept that RG7112 is effective in the treatment of solid tumors expressing wild-type p53. Inhibition of the interaction between MDM2 and p53 proteins is a promising anticancer therapy, and RG7112 has been shown to be a potent inhibitor of the oncoprotein MDM2.",No
Are there any specific antidotes for dabigatran?,Yes,"Justification: A specific antidote for the direct thrombin inhibitor, dabigatran, has been approved for use. The antidote, idarucizumab, is a monoclonal antibody that has been developed to neutralize the anticoagulant effect of dabigatran. This antidote is available for use in cases where rapid reversal of dabigatran's anticoagulant effect is required, such as in emergency situations or during surgery. However, it is important to note that there is limited experience with dabigatran overdoses and the efficacy of idarucizumab in these situations may not be fully understood.",No
Are there any Decision support systems for chronic pain management ?,Yes,"There is evidence to suggest that Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS) can be beneficial for chronic pain management. These systems are designed to aid healthcare professionals in making clinical decisions by providing patient-specific assessments or recommendations. They can help aggregate and contextualize disparate information elements, thereby improving the accuracy of pain assessment and supporting clinical decision-making. While the effectiveness of CDSS in improving patient outcomes in a cost-effective manner is uncertain, their potential to enhance the ability of primary care physicians to manage chronic pain is recognized. Furthermore, a novel CDSS tool has been proposed for evidence-based management of back pain. However, the successful application of clinical guideline-based decision support systems in chronic disease management, including chronic pain, remains limited.",No
Does amiodarone affect thyroid hormone receptors in the myocardium?,Yes,"Amiodarone, a potent antiarrhythmic drug, has been found to have significant effects on thyroid hormone metabolism, which may contribute to its therapeutic action and adverse effects. The drug has been reported to interfere with thyroid function and hormone metabolism, causing hypothyroidism or thyrotoxicosis. Moreover, amiodarone has been shown to have important effects on the peripheral metabolism of thyroid hormones, including inhibition of extrathyroidal triiodothyronine production and rarely, iodine-induced hypothyroidism.

Evidence supporting the hypothesis that amiodarone affects thyroid hormone receptors in the myocardium comprises the observation that the drug exerts an inhibitory effect on the binding of triiodothyronine (T3) to thyroid hormone receptors (TR) alpha-1 and beta-1 in vitro, and on the expression of particular T3-dependent genes in vivo. Furthermore, amiodarone has been found to induce a local ""hypothyroid-like condition"" in the heart, which may explain some of the cardiac effects of the drug.

In conclusion, amiodarone has been shown to affect thyroid hormone receptors in the myocardium, which may contribute to its therapeutic action and adverse effects. Further research is needed to fully understand the relationship between amiodarone and thyroid hormone metabolism, and to optimize its use in the treatment of arrhythmias.",Yes
Does thyroid hormone affect cardiac remodeling?,Yes,"Thyroid hormone indeed affects cardiac remodeling, as evidenced by its significant impact on cardiac function and structure. Thyroid hormone exerts broad effects on the adult heart, playing a pivotal role in cardiac homeostasis. It acts on the heart and peripheral vasculature in multiple ways, influencing cardiac performance directly and indirectly via changes in peripheral circulation. Excessive production of thyroid hormone results in an increased cardiac output and improved cardiac work efficiency, but reduced cardiac reserve. Conversely, heart dysfunctions have been shown to be associated with altered concentrations of thyroid hormones. Changes in thyroid status are associated with profound alterations in biochemical and physiological functioning of cardiac muscle. Recent research has revealed novel actions of thyroid hormone on the heart, which may be of important physiological and therapeutic relevance. However, the influence of thyroid hormones on cardiac remodeling has not been thoroughly investigated at the molecular and cellular levels, warranting further research.",No
Are there any HCV replication inhibitors available?,Yes,"Justification:

Currently, there are several novel, small molecular inhibitors of HCV replication that are entering early clinical trials in humans. These direct antiviral agents specifically target the non-structural proteins involved in HCV replication and are in phase II/III development. Compounds that block the replication of subgenomic HCV RNA in liver cells have demonstrated antiviral effects in the clinic. Additionally, the NS5A inhibitor ledipasvir, the nucleotide polymerase inhibitor sofosbuvir, and ribavirin have been assessed in a phase 2, open-label study for patients infected with HCV genotypes 1 or 4. Protease inhibitors (PIs) of HCV provide an additional or alternative therapy for chronic infection. Furthermore, the development of inhibitors of the HCV NS5B RNA polymerase represents a promising strategy for identifying novel anti-HCV therapeutics. Antiviral agents specifically targeting either the HCV protease or polymerase, or other targets, are now in clinical development. The 293b4alpha cell line has been formatted into a semi-high throughput, cell-based screen for inhibitors of HCV replication.",Yes
Is cocaine use associated with increased risk for intracerebral hemorrhage?,Yes,"Cocaine use has been identified as a significant risk factor for intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), a well-recognized complication of recreational cocaine use. Recent cocaine ingestion is associated with hemorrhages that occur more frequently in subcortical locations, have a higher risk of intraventricular hemorrhage, and have a poor prognosis compared to patients with cocaine-negative, spontaneous ICH. Cocaine abuse has been reported to be associated with an increased frequency of hemorrhagic or ischemic stroke. The relationship between severe cocaine-induced hypertension and the development of subarachnoid or intracerebral hemorrhages is noted, and is related to sudden transient increases of blood pressure related to cocaine use. Cocaine is a known vasoactive drug associated with poor clinical outcomes and high in-hospital mortality related to aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. The association of prior cocaine use with the incidence of vasospasm and delayed cerebral ischemia remains controversial. However, the evidence suggests that cocaine use is associated with an increased risk for intracerebral hemorrhage.",Yes
Is miR-21 related to carcinogenesis?,Yes,"Justification: MiR-21 has been identified as an oncogene and confirmed to play an important role in carcinogenesis in various types of cancer. It has been linked to tumor progression through targeting of tumor-suppressor genes and is overexpressed in various tumors. MiR-21 has been recognized as an ""onco-microrna"" with the activity of negatively modulating the expression of tumor-suppressor genes. Its overexpression has been reported in several human cancers and has been shown to promote tumor growth in animal models. Furthermore, miR-21 has been implicated in the cellular processes of cervical cancer and may serve as a target for effective therapies. These findings suggest that miR-21 is indeed related to carcinogenesis.",Yes
Are thyroid hormone receptor alpha1 mutations  implicated in thyroid hormone resistance syndrome?,Yes,"Justification: Thyroid hormone receptor alpha1 (TRÎ±1) mutations are indeed implicated in thyroid hormone resistance syndrome (RTH). Specifically, mutations in the thyroid hormone receptor alpha (THRA) gene, which encodes TRÎ±1, cause resistance to thyroid hormone alpha (RTHÎ±). This is a rare genetic disease characterized by variable manifestations reminiscent of untreated congenital hypothyroidism, a raised triiodothyronine/thyroxine ratio, and normal thyrotropin levels. RTHÎ± is a form of RTH that displays important variability in its clinical presentation. It is important to note that mutations in the thyroid hormone receptor beta (TRÎ²) gene can also cause RTH, but the question specifically asks about TRÎ±1 mutations.",Yes
Is PLK2 involved in alpha-synuclein phosphorylation in Parkinson disease?,Yes,"PLK2, a serine/threonine kinase, has been identified as a significant factor in the phosphorylation of alpha-synuclein at serine-129 in Parkinson's disease. This kinase has been recognized as the major enzyme responsible for phosphorylation of alpha-synuclein in vitro and in vivo, suggesting a key role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease and other synucleinopathies. The phosphorylation of alpha-synuclein at serine-129 is a hallmark of both sporadic and familial Parkinson's disease, and PLK2 is responsible for this activity under physiological conditions. Furthermore, elevated phosphorylation of alpha-synuclein, facilitated by PLK2, correlates with its aggregation and toxic accumulation in neurons. Therefore, it can be concluded that PLK2 plays a crucial role in alpha-synuclein phosphorylation in Parkinson's disease.",Yes
Is there evidence for somatic mosaicism in Tuberous Sclerosis?,Yes,"Justification: The context provides evidence that somatic mosaicism occurs in Tuberous Sclerosis. Superimposed mosaicism is described as occurring more frequently than simple segmental mosaicism in Tuberous Sclerosis. Additionally, the context mentions that mosaicism for Tuberous Sclerosis Complex mutations has been documented, complicating genetic counseling for families. This suggests that somatic mosaicism, a condition in which cells within the same individual have different genotypes, is a recognized phenomenon in Tuberous Sclerosis.",Yes
Does smoking increase risk for glioblastoma?,Yes,"Evidence from multiple cohort studies indicates a positive association between cigarette smoking and an increased risk of glioma. The duration of smoking, number of cigarettes smoked per day, and pack-years of smoking were all associated with increased glioma risk, compared to non-smokers. After adjusting for confounders, smoking increased the risk of glioma deaths by 11% (odds ratio [OR] = 1.11; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.03-1.21). For individuals aged 50 years or older, smoking was associated with a 25% higher risk of glioma death (OR = 1.25; 95% CI: 1.15-1.38). The increased risk for smokers who smoked 20 or more cigarettes daily for 30 years or more was 53% (OR = 1.53; 95% CI: 1.34-1.74). These findings suggest that cigarette smoking is associated with an elevated risk of adult glioma.",No
Is Wnt16b secreted in response to chemotherapy?,Yes,"In the context of cancer treatment, the study demonstrates that Wnt16b can indeed be expressed and secreted into the microenvironment by human ovarian fibroblasts following DNA damage-associated treatments, including chemotherapy drugs and radiation. This secretion of Wnt16b plays a role in immune regulation and highlights its potential significance in cancer treatment. The study further emphasizes the importance of understanding the roles of Wnt signaling pathways in cancer progression and their relationship with chemotherapy resistance. However, it is still unclear whether the Wnt/Î²-catenin pathway plays a role in resistance to antitumor chemotherapy drugs. The study also reveals that Wnt2 is highly expressed in colorectal cancer cells and that Wnt5a may play an important role in regulating chemosensitivity to anticancer drugs in ovarian cancer cells. These findings suggest that Wnt signaling pathways are complex and multifaceted, and their roles in cancer progression and treatment warrant further investigation.",Yes
Do DNA double-strand breaks play a causal role in carcinogenesis?,Yes,"DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are considered to play a causal role in carcinogenesis due to their potential genotoxicity and lethality. DSBs can arise from both endogenous and exogenous factors, including ionizing radiation, radiomimetic compounds, and environmental carcinogens. These breaks can lead to structural chromosome aberrations and inter-chromosomal deletion-recombination, which are recognized as central components of carcinogenesis. Although the relationship between DSBs and carcinogenesis is complex and not fully understood, it is generally accepted that DSBs are the principal initiating lesions in the process. The difficulty in establishing a direct cause-and-effect relationship between DSBs and cellular effects in mammalian cells does not negate the potential role of DSBs in carcinogenesis.",No
Do conserved noncoding elements co-occur with matrix-attachment regions?,Yes,"Justification: Conserved noncoding elements (CNEs) exhibit extreme noncoding conservation in metazoan genomes and are often found in the vicinity of developmentally regulated genes. Matrix attachment regions (MARs) are DNA elements defined by their ability to bind to isolated nuclear matrices in vitro. It has been observed that ninety noncoding sequences meeting these criteria were discovered, and the analysis of 15 of these elements found that about 70% were conserved across mammals. This suggests that CNEs co-occur with MARs, as they are both noncoding regions with functional significance in the genome. Furthermore, the fact that most verified functional elements in noncoding DNA contain a highly conserved core region supports the idea that CNEs and MARs may be related. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that CNEs co-occur with MARs in the genome.",No
Are Drosophila ultraconserved elements candidate ncRNAs?,Yes,"The study reveals that Drosophila ultraconserved elements (UCEs) are potential candidates for non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). The identification of an ultraconserved element in the drosophila melanogaster homothorax (hth) gene, which appears to be involved in the control of hth pre-mRNA splicing, suggests a functional role for these conserved sequences. Furthermore, the isolation of a U5 snRNA-like molecule with a variant SM binding site and a distinct 3' hairpin sequence supports the hypothesis that UCEs may function as ncRNAs. The conservation of UCEs in intergenic and intronic sequences, as well as at intron-exon junctions, also suggests a regulatory role for these sequences in gene expression. The finding that Drosophila possesses the core gene silencing machinery, but lacks the canonical RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RDRPs) that are involved in small RNA-dependent gene silencing pathways, further supports the idea that UCEs may have distinct functions in Drosophila. The striking degree of conservation between each Drosophila RNA and its vertebrate cognate, as well as the blocks of homology among the Drosophila small nuclear RNAs, also suggest that UCEs may be functionally important. The identification of UCEs flanking known developmental genes in Drosophila, as well as the conservation of many of these sequences in other insect species, also supports the idea that UCEs may have functional roles in development. Overall, the evidence suggests that Drosophila UCEs are potential candidates for ncRNAs with functional roles in gene expression and development.",Yes
Does surgery for ovarian endometriomas improve fertility?,Inconclusive,"The impact of surgery for ovarian endometriomas on fertility remains a topic of debate and ongoing research. While some studies suggest that laparoscopic excision of endometriomas may increase the chances of spontaneous conception, its value in women undergoing IVF-ICSI cycles is still debated. The available data in the literature indicate that surgical management of endometriomas has no significant effect on IVF pregnancy rates and ovarian response to stimulation compared with no treatment. However, it has been questioned whether the excision of endometriomas could decrease the function of the operated ovary and affect subsequent fertility. Pre-cycle removal of endometrioma may have an adverse impact on ovarian reserve, and pregnancy outcomes seem to be similar with or without surgery in patients undergoing IVF treatment. Therefore, the overall evidence is inconclusive, and further research is needed to determine the optimal approach for managing endometriomas in infertile women before IVF.",Yes
Are ACTA1 (alpha actin) and NEB (nebulin) genes related to nemaline myopathy?,Yes,"The ACTA1 (alpha actin) gene is directly related to nemaline myopathy, as mutations in this gene are responsible for a significant proportion of nemaline myopathy cases, including up to 50% of severe forms of the disease. These mutations lead to muscle weakness and hypotonia, and are associated with a range of defects at the biochemical level, as well as in cultured fibroblasts and muscle cells.

     Additionally, the NEB (nebulin) gene is also related to nemaline myopathy, as it has been shown that nebulin can appear abnormal secondary to a primary defect in actin. Nebulin is a protein that plays a critical role in the organization and function of the actin cytoskeleton, and mutations in the NEB gene can lead to nemaline myopathy and other muscle disorders.

     In summary, both the ACTA1 and NEB genes are related to nemaline myopathy, with mutations in these genes being responsible for a significant proportion of cases of this clinically and genetically heterogeneous muscle disorder.",Yes
Could RG7112 be used as cancer therapy?,Insufficient,"Information

The context provided does not include any information regarding RG7112, which is a p53-MDM2 inhibitor used in cancer therapy. As such, it is not possible to determine whether RG7112 could be used as a cancer therapy based solely on the given context. Further information regarding the specific properties, mechanisms of action, and clinical data of RG7112 would be required to make an informed assessment.",Yes
Does thyroid hormone affect cardiac remodeling ?,Yes,"Thyroid hormone has been demonstrated to exert significant effects on cardiac function and structure. It plays a crucial role in myocardial development and function, and influences cardiac performance directly and indirectly via changes in peripheral circulation. Notably, both excessive and insufficient production of thyroid hormone have been implicated in the pathogenesis of clinical cardiac diseases. While the precise influence of thyroid hormones on cardiac remodeling at the molecular and cellular levels has not been thoroughly investigated, recent research has revealed novel actions of thyroid hormone on the heart that may be of physiological and therapeutic relevance. Changes in thyroid status have been associated with profound alterations in biochemical and physiological functioning of cardiac muscle, and thyroid hormone has been shown to have important cellular growth functions in both physiological and pathophysiological states. Thus, it can be inferred that thyroid hormone does indeed affect cardiac remodeling.",Yes
Is armodafinil used for treatment of insomnia?,No,"Armodafinil, a wakefulness-promoting medication, is primarily used to manage excessive sleepiness associated with narcolepsy, obstructive sleep apnea/hypopnea syndrome, and shift work sleep disorder. Its pharmacological action is exerted on areas of the brain involved in controlling wakefulness. Armodafinil has been shown to improve wakefulness, cognition, and reduce fatigue in patients with these conditions, even when the underlying condition is treated. It is also being studied as an adjunctive treatment for patients with schizophrenia receiving antipsychotic therapy and for major depressive episodes associated with bipolar I disorder. However, there is no evidence to suggest that armodafinil is used for the treatment of insomnia. Insomnia is a sleep disorder characterized by difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep, and it is typically managed with medications that promote sleep rather than wakefulness.",Yes
Are there currently applications of deep learning in genomics?,Yes,"Deep learning has been applied to genomics in recent years, with a range of applications from predicting regulatory elements to cancer classification. The integration of vast datasets, learning complex relationships, and incorporating existing knowledge are key strengths of deep learning that have been leveraged in biological research and biomedical applications. Deep learning has also been utilized to speed up the DNA sequencing process and is expected to be incorporated into the majority of analysis pipelines in the future. With genomics producing big data, most bioinformatics algorithms are based on machine learning methodologies, including deep learning, to identify patterns, make predictions, and model the progression or treatment of diseases. Deep learning has achieved great success in various fields, including bioinformatics, and is well-suited for biological problems that require automatic or hierarchical feature representation for biological data when prior knowledge is limited.",Yes
Are CpG islands located close to housekeeping genes?,Yes,"CpG islands are predominantly found in close proximity to housekeeping genes, as they are often located in the promoter regions of these genes. These CpG-rich regions, characterized by a high frequency of CpG dinucleotides and a length greater than 200 base pairs, are considered important for the regulation of gene expression. CpG islands play a crucial role in protecting adjacent housekeeping genes from de novo DNA methylation, thereby maintaining their transcriptionally active state. Furthermore, the transcription regulation of approximately half of human genes, primarily housekeeping genes, involves CpG islands and their methylation states. The presence of CpG islands near housekeeping genes is a common feature in mammalian genomes, including humans, mice, and chickens. This association between CpG islands and housekeeping genes suggests a significant role in gene regulation and expression, as well as a potential link to evolution in vertebrates.",Yes
Is COL5A2 gene associated to ischemic heart disease?,No,"The COL5A2 gene, encoding collagen type V alpha 2, is not mentioned in the provided context as being associated with ischemic heart disease. Instead, the context discusses several other genes and their associations with coronary artery disease (CAD) and myocardial infarction (MI), such as C5L2, NT5C2, COX-2, COL1A2, and ALOX5AP. The COL1A2 gene, which encodes collagen type I alpha 2, is specifically mentioned as a potential risk factor for intracranial aneurysm, particularly in Asian populations. However, no direct association between COL5A2 and ischemic heart disease is indicated in the given information.",Yes
Have microRNAs been implicated in pharmacogenomics?,Yes,"Recent studies have suggested that microRNAs (miRNAs) can be targeted by drugs and have their expression levels altered, indicating their potential role as a novel regulatory layer in drug metabolism and drug targets. MiRNAs play a significant role in pharmacogenomics by down-regulating genes that are important for drug function. They can also impact drug efficacy and toxicity by regulating the expression of pharmacogenomic-related genes. MiRNA variations have been shown to affect drug resistance, efficacy, and metabolism, opening new avenues of pharmacogenomics research. Genetic variants affecting miRNA binding (miRSNPs) have been associated with altered drug response. A major discovery is the ability of miRNAs to determine the efficacy of drugs, leading to the development of the field of 'miRNA pharmacogenomics'. MiRNA-based inference methods have been developed to predict drug-disease causal relationships. In silico evaluation of miRNA binding regions in genes known to affect drug response has further illustrated the potential of miRNAs in affecting drug response. Therefore, it can be concluded that miRNAs have been implicated in pharmacogenomics.",Yes
Is nicotinamide effective for skin cancer prevention?,Yes,"Nicotinamide, a form of vitamin B3, has demonstrated efficacy as a chemopreventive agent against skin cancer in both topical and oral forms. Preliminary human studies and murine models have shown its potential in preventing skin cancers and enhancing the regression of actinic keratoses. Nicotinamide has also been found to reduce keratinocyte carcinoma in high-risk patients in a randomized controlled trial setting. Furthermore, it has been shown to prevent ultraviolet-induced immunosuppression in humans and mice. A recent clinical trial found a protective role of niacinamide, a derivative of niacin, against skin cancer recurrence. However, it is important to note that the safety of nicotinamide is still a topic of debate, as some preclinical studies have shown that nicotine enhances tumor cell growth in vitro and in vivo. Nevertheless, the evidence suggests that nicotinamide is effective for skin cancer prevention.",Yes
Do Parkinson's disease patients experience stridor?,Yes,"Parkinson's disease (PD) patients can experience stridor, which is an abnormal, high-pitched, and noisy sound caused by turbulent airflow through a narrowed or partially obstructed airway. In the context of PD, stridor can occur due to various causes, such as laryngospasm, laryngeal dystonia, or bilateral vocal cord palsy. These conditions may result from the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons, which is a hallmark of PD, and can impact the motor and nonmotor systems, including voice and speech production.

PD patients may also exhibit a worsening of tremor before the emergence of levodopa-induced dyskinesia (LD), which can further exacerbate respiratory symptoms. Additionally, PD patients may experience excessive secretions, leading to prolonged laryngospasm and acute stridor. Therefore, it is essential to recognize different causes of stridor in PD patients, as this affects management and treatment strategies.",Yes
Is there an association between serum interleukin-6 concentrations and outcomes of stroke patients?,Yes,"The evidence from the present study suggests that Interleukin-6 (IL-6) contributes to the determination of the severity of ischemic strokes and may be useful in predicting prognosis. IL-6 is a pleiotropic cytokine that plays a central role in the pathogenesis of stroke and is reportedly increased in serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from acute stroke patients. Elevated serum IL-6 has been found in acute stroke patients and is one of the inflammatory mediators characterized by elevated levels in ischemic stroke patients. IL-6 and TNF-alpha release from stimulated blood cells was increased in stroke patients, compared to controls. Clinically, IL-6 values obtained in the first week post-stroke have been shown to correlate with infarct size and outcome. The results show a complex but potentially beneficial effect of intravenously administered IL-6 in experimental stroke. The study also investigated the frequency of IL-6 promoter polymorphism rs1800795 (-174 G>C) and possible association of this polymorphism with IL-6 levels and the outcome after stroke. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between IL-6 and sIL-6R in stroke patients. The study hypothesized that concentrations of interleukin 6 (IL-6), serum amyloid A, tumor necrosis factor-Î± receptor 1, CD40 ligand, and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 would predict recurrent ischemic stroke and major vascular events after recent lacunar stroke. The study demonstrates the potential of employing high-sensitivity IL-6 as an early stage biomarker for the prognosis of acute ischemic stroke.",Yes
Could bioprinting be used in regenerative medicine against bone disease?,Yes,"3D bioprinting of bone tissue has been identified as a promising approach in regenerative medicine against bone diseases. The development of hybrid bioactive materials suitable for 3D printing of scaffolds that mimic the natural composition and structure of healthy bone is a significant advancement in this field. These bioactive and biomimetic materials can promote bone tissue regeneration by directing cell response, while the desired scaffold architecture can be tailored using 3D printing technologies. This strategy offers a promising solution for treating a wide range of bone injuries, particularly those associated with pathological conditions such as osteoporosis. The use of chemically modified mRNAs, in conjunction with biomaterials, has also been proposed as a potential approach for the clinical treatment of bone injuries and defects. The development of these 3D bioprinted models could lead to the advancement of novel therapy testing and potential relief for chronic bone diseases. Furthermore, the use of RNA molecules in coating and delivery on different types of scaffolds has been discussed, indicating the potential for further advancements in this field.",Yes
Is macroautophagy a selective degradation process?,Yes,"Macroautophagy is a highly conserved catabolic process that involves the degradation of cytoplasmic components, including proteins and organelles, within lysosomes. While initially considered a nonselective bulk degradation process, recent evidence indicates that macroautophagy can exhibit selectivity in the removal of misfolded or aggregated proteins. This selectivity is mediated by specific autophagy receptors and adaptors that recognize and target cargo for degradation. Therefore, macroautophagy can be considered a selective degradation process.",Yes
Is there any link between conserved noncoding elements and alternative splicing in vertebrates?,Yes,"Evidence suggests a link between conserved noncoding elements and alternative splicing in vertebrates. Multi-species conserved non-coding elements occur in the vertebrate genome and are clustered in the vicinity of developmentally regulated genes. The function of many intronic sequence blocks conserved between human and mouse is hypothesized to be the regulation of alternative splicing. Pentameric and hexameric intronic sequences serve as binding sites for splicing regulatory factors, and conserved non-coding elements are hypothesized to function as enhancer elements under evolutionary constraint. These findings suggest that alternative splicing of symmetrical and non-symmetrical exons is governed by different selective pressures and serves different purposes.",Yes
Is muscle regeneration possible in mdx mice with the use of induced mesenchymal stem cells?,Yes,"Muscle regeneration is possible in mdx mice with the use of induced mesenchymal stem cells. This is supported by evidence that bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (bm-mscs) facilitate muscle regeneration in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) model mice. The mdx mouse, a genetic homologue of human DMD, has been attributed with a greater regenerative capacity of its skeletal muscles. Muscle-derived stem cells (mdscs) isolated from murine skeletal tissue have displayed the capability to commit to the myogenic lineage and regenerate more efficiently than myoblasts in skeletal and cardiac muscle in mdx mice. Furthermore, the injection of normal myoblasts or mdscs into the muscle of dystrophin-deficient mdx mice results in the incorporation of a number of donor myoblasts into the host muscle. In comparison with satellite cells, mdscs display an improved transplantation capacity in dystrophic mdx muscle that is attributed to their ability to undergo long-term proliferation, self-renewal, and multipotent differentiation, including differentiation toward endothelial and neuronal lineages. Intramuscular and intravenous injection of mc13 cells result in muscle regeneration and partial restoration of dystrophin in mdx mice.",Yes
Is the SDHAF2 gene encoding a protein necessary for flavination of SDHA?,Yes,"The SDHAF2 gene encodes a protein that is necessary for flavination of SDHA. This is evidenced by the fact that SDHAF2 is an assembly factor required for FAD insertion into the SDH1 subunit. The increased levels of SDHAF2 suggest that the stabilization of soluble FAD-SDH1 depends on SDHAF2 availability. Furthermore, SDH assembly appears to require FAD binding but not necessarily covalent FAD attachment, which implies that SDHAF2 plays a crucial role in the flavination process. The impaired assembly of SDH with the C-terminal SDH1 mutants also suggests that FAD binding is important to stabilize the SDH1 conformation enabling association with SDH2 and the membrane anchor subunits. Therefore, it can be concluded that the SDHAF2 gene encoding a protein is necessary for flavination of SDHA.",Yes
Is zolpidem an antibiotic?,No,"Zolpidem is not an antibiotic. It is a well-known drug used for the treatment of sleeping disorders, specifically classified as an imidazopyridine hypnotic drug. Zolpidem acts as a specific agonist of the omega-1 (bzd1) receptors and exerts its effects via benzodiazepine binding sites on gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors. Unlike benzodiazepines, zolpidem exerts sedative actions at relatively low doses. Its pharmacological profile includes anticonvulsant, antipunishment, and behavioral depressant actions. Zolpidem is considered safe with respect to potential interactions through ahr- and pxr-dependent induction of drug-metabolizing cyps. In summary, zolpidem is a hypnotic medication that primarily functions through activating GABA receptors, and it does not possess antibiotic properties.",Yes
Can desvenlafaxine be used at a dose of 50mg/day?,Yes,"Desvenlafaxine, a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, has been studied for its efficacy, safety, and tolerability in treating major depressive disorder (MDD). The recommended dose of 50 mg/day has been found to be effective in preventing relapse of depression during a 6-month period in patients who demonstrated stable response after 20 weeks of open-label treatment. Furthermore, desvenlafaxine at 50 mg/day has been shown to significantly improve depressive symptoms, regardless of severity at baseline, and is effective in treating both moderate and severe MDD. These results demonstrate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of desvenlafaxine 50 mg/day for treating MDD. Additionally, desvenlafaxine 50 mg/day has been found to significantly improve depressive symptoms compared with placebo in MDD patients with clinically relevant anxiety symptoms. The starting dose of 50 mg/day is the usually effective therapeutic dose and the optimal dose when considering both efficacy and tolerability for most patients.",Yes
Can ferric carboxymaltose be used to treat anemia in inflammatory bowel disease patients?,Yes,"Ferric carboxymaltose (FCM) has been shown to be an effective treatment for iron deficiency anemia (IDA) in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). A prospective, multicentre, observational study demonstrated the efficacy and safety of FCM in treating IDA in IBD patients. Furthermore, a randomized, placebo-controlled trial demonstrated that administration of FCM prevented anemia in IBD patients with low levels of serum ferritin. FCM has also been shown to improve symptoms and quality of life in patients with chronic heart failure and iron deficiency. In addition, FCM is a nondextran iron preparation that has been approved for the intravenous treatment of IDA in adult patients with intolerance or unsatisfactory response to oral iron or with nondialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease. Therefore, FCM can be used to treat anemia in IBD patients.",Yes
Is there any association of the chromosomal region harboring the gene ITIH3 with schizophrenia?,Yes,"Justification: Genome-wide association studies have repeatedly identified common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in or near the Inter-Alpha-Trypsin Inhibitor Heavy Chain 3 (ITIH3) gene as being associated with schizophrenia and related psychiatric disorders. A recent genome-wide analysis indicated that a polymorphism (rs2535629) of ITIH3 showed the strongest association signal with susceptibility to psychiatric disorders in Caucasian populations. Furthermore, evidence suggests that functional variants at the CHI3L1 locus, which is located near ITIH3, influence the genetic risk of schizophrenia. The public expression data also showed that ITIH3 may have a role in the development of the human brain and suggested a cis-eQTL effect for rs2535629 and rs3617 on ITIH3 in the hippocampus. These findings suggest that the chromosomal region harboring the ITIH3 gene is indeed associated with schizophrenia.",Yes
Is the regulation of Vsr endonuclease independent of the growth phase of bacteria?,No,"The regulation of Vsr endonuclease is not independent of the growth phase of bacteria. The context suggests that many virulence-associated genes in Streptococcus pyogenes are controlled in a growth phase-dependent manner. Furthermore, the regulation of multiple unrelated processes, including central carbon metabolism, motility, biofilm formation, and bacterial virulence, is controlled by the post-transcriptional regulator Csra in different bacteria. Additionally, the results provide further evidence that Rgg contributes to growth phase-dependent gene regulation in strain Nz131. These findings indicate that the regulation of Vsr endonuclease, like other virulence-associated genes, is likely to be dependent on the growth phase of bacteria.",Yes
Are there interactomes available for POU5F1 and SOX2?,Yes,"Interactomes for POU5F1 and SOX2 have been identified, as these transcription factors play crucial roles in early embryonic development and pluripotency. Specifically, POU5F1 (also known as OCT4 or OCT3) and SOX2 form partnerships with various co-factors, such as OCT1 (encoded by the POU2F1 gene) and PAX6. These interactions are essential for lens and nasal placode induction, as well as for regulating gene expression in embryonic stem cells. The molecular mechanisms underlying these interactions involve cooperative DNA binding and protein interactions, which elicit large transactivation potentials. However, the precise mechanisms through which SOX2 accomplishes its functions remain poorly understood. In summary, interactomes for POU5F1 and SOX2 have been identified, and their roles in transcriptional regulation and early embryonic development are increasingly apparent.",Yes
Is Rheumatoid Arthritis related to myopathy?,Yes,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is indeed related to myopathy, as evidenced by the well-recognized concept of muscle involvement in RA. This involvement is driven by various causes, including inflammation, drugs, impaired joint flexibility, and sedentarism. Chronic inflammation in RA is associated with disturbances in muscle and bone metabolism, leading to muscle impairments that contribute to disability and cardiometabolic disease. Overlapping forms of myositis, when the patient also meets the criteria for RA, affect 3%-5% of myositis patients. In RA, chronic inflammation, physical inactivity, and medication toxicities impair skeletal muscle, leading to impaired contractile function and sarcopenic obesity. The usual clinical presentation of inflammatory myopathy associated with connective tissue disease is similar to isolated polymyositis or dermatomyositis, with subacute onset of proximal weakness affecting both upper and lower girdle with high serum CK level. In numerous cases, the intensification of inflammatory lesions resembles changes seen in arthritis, particularly in RA, which can inhibit the differential diagnosis by means of imaging examinations.",Yes
Is EZH2 associated with prostate cancer?,Yes,"The overexpression of the enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) protein, a known repressor of gene transcription, has been reported to be associated with biological malignancy of prostate cancer and several other cancers. EZH2 promotes proliferation and invasion of prostate cancer cells, which can account for the correlation between EZH2 expression levels and an adverse prostate cancer prognosis. EZH2 expression in prostate cancer correlates with progression to hormone-refractory and metastatic disease. Knockdown of endogenous EZH2 reduced proliferation of androgen-responsive and androgen-independent prostate cancer cells. EZH2 mRNA expression density in the metastatic prostate cancer group was significantly higher than in the control and localized prostate cancer groups. EZH2 binds HNF1B locus and suppresses HNF1B expression in prostate cancer cell lines, which is further supported by the reverse correlation between EZH2 and HNF1B expression in clinical samples. Prostate cancer cytoplasmic and total EZH2 expression were significantly associated with metastasis development postradiotherapy. These results suggest that overexpression of EZH2 is correlated with malignant potential and poor prognosis in prostate cancers. EZH2 analysis might therefore be of clinical value for risk stratification of prostate cancer.",Yes
Is there any cross-talk between the Wnt and the Akt pathways?,Yes,"Justification: The context suggests that a cross-talk between the Wnt and Akt signaling pathways is possible. The dopamine D2 receptor (D2DR) is known to regulate Akt and may also target the Wnt pathway. Both Akt and Wnt signaling cascades inhibit glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3), which is a critical component of the Wnt pathway. Furthermore, the study demonstrates that the expression of P-glycoprotein (Pgp) in human brain endothelial cells is controlled by a cross-talk between canonical and non-canonical Wnt pathways. These findings suggest that the Wnt and Akt pathways interact with each other, and their crosstalk may play a crucial role in various biological processes, including cancer development and progression.",Yes
Has the protein GFP been used in transgenesis for live protein imaging?,Yes,"Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) has been extensively used in transgenesis for live protein imaging. GFP, an autofluorescent protein, has been widely utilized as a reporter gene in various areas of life science. Its ability to be genetically fused to proteins of interest has enabled the localization and quantitation of gene products in living cells and organisms. GFP has been employed in diverse cellular biology approaches, primarily as a protein tag or to monitor gene expression. Its use in transgenesis has revolutionized cell biology, facilitating the observation of proteins in living cells and spurring the development of GFP variants and alternative protein labeling techniques. The ""enhanced"" GFP (EGFP), a mutant version optimized for flow cytometry and microscopy detection, has been investigated for its suitability as a reporter gene for retroviral transduction protocols. GFP has also been used as a marker of gene expression and a single-cell marker in living organisms in cell biology studies.",Yes
Is the Snord116 cluster associated with the Prader-Willi syndrome?,Yes,"The Snord116 cluster has been identified as a critical factor in the development of Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS), a complex genetic disorder characterized by obesity and neurobehavioral disturbances. The Snord116 cluster is located in the 15q11-13 region of paternally expressed genes, and its loss has been implicated in the pathogenesis of PWS. This region contains non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), including the Snord116 cluster, which are believed to play a role in the hyperphagic phenotype observed in PWS. The Snord116 cluster has been specifically associated with the development of PWS, although its contribution to the behavioral aspects of the disease remains unknown. The finding of a human case with a deletion encompassing the Snord116 gene cluster, but preserving the expression of flanking genes, further supports the hypothesis that the lack of the paternal Snord116 gene cluster has a determinant role in the pathogenesis of PWS.",Yes
Is poly (ADP- ribosylation) involved in transcriptional control?,Yes,"Poly (ADP-ribosylation) is indeed involved in transcriptional control, as evidenced by its role in regulating chromatin structure and function, and its impact on the activity of transcription factors and coregulators. This post-translational modification, mediated by the enzyme poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), has been shown to regulate transcription of genes that are induced by DNA-damaging agents. Furthermore, poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of nuclear proteins, such as DNA sequence-specific regulatory proteins, can lead to their inactivation and subsequent induction of transcription of DNA repair enzymes, such as DNA polymerase beta. Additionally, accumulating evidence suggests that PARP-1 plays a critical role in gene expression regulatory machinery during development and in response to specific cellular signals. Therefore, it is clear that poly (ADP-ribosylation) plays a significant role in transcriptional control.",Yes
Is nimodipine recommended for prevention of vasospasm in aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage patients?,Yes,"Nimodipine, a calcium channel blocker, is recommended for the prevention of vasospasm in aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage patients. This is supported by numerous randomized studies that have demonstrated its efficacy, either administered orally or intravenously, in preventing vasospasm and its clinical consequences in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage following rupture of an intracranial aneurysm. Nimodipine is the most frequently used drug for cerebral vasospasm management and is the only approved medication that has been shown to reduce ischemic complications, infarct size, and improve neurological outcome after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. Current guidelines recommend the administration of nimodipine for the prevention of delayed cerebral ischemia after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage.",Yes
Is lenvatinib effective for thyroid cancer?,Yes,"Lenvatinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, has been demonstrated to significantly improve efficacy outcomes in patients with radioiodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer (RR-DTC) in a phase 3 clinical trial. Notably, lenvatinib has shown a substantial improvement in median progression-free survival compared to placebo, with an objective response rate of 64.8%. Furthermore, lenvatinib has been approved for the treatment of patients with unresectable thyroid cancer, including anaplastic thyroid cancer. Subgroup analysis has also indicated that lenvatinib is effective for all patients with RR thyroid carcinoma, regardless of age, histological subtypes, radiological subtypes, and mutation status. However, it is important to note that the long-term effects of lenvatinib have not been fully investigated, and adverse events have been reported in almost all patients.",Yes
Was tamoxifen tested for treatment of glioma patients?,Yes,"Recent studies have indicated that tamoxifen, a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) commonly used in breast cancer treatment, has potential chemotherapeutic effects on glioma. In vitro experiments have demonstrated that high-dose tamoxifen exhibits cytotoxic activity against glioma cells and inhibits the proliferation of some estrogen receptor-negative cell lines, including malignant glioma. The present study further investigated the effects of tamoxifen on cell growth and radiosensitivity in C6 glioma cells using a colony-forming assay and a tetrazolium-formazan growth rate assay. The results suggest that tamoxifen might have a chemotherapeutic effect on temozolomide-resistant glioma through its direct action on mitochondrial complex I inhibition. Moreover, tamoxifen and a novel benzopyranone with SERM activity, CC-8490, have been shown to induce glioma cell apoptosis in a dose- and time-dependent manner, suppress tumor growth in vivo, and extend animal survival in glioma xenograft models. These findings demonstrate the potential of SERMs, including tamoxifen, for the treatment of malignant gliomas, particularly when combined with simultaneous inhibition of the NF-ÎºB pathway. Overall, these results suggest that tamoxifen has been tested for the treatment of glioma patients and could potentially serve as a useful agent in combination therapy for glioma.",Yes
Are there any animal models for Niemann-Pick C1 disease?,Yes,"Justification: Animal models for Niemann-Pick Type C1 (NPC1) disease have been developed, including a mouse model that exhibits neuropathology similar to the human condition. This mouse model, the BALB/c strain, displays cerebral atrophy, demyelination of the corpus callosum, and degeneration of cerebellar Purkinje cells, which are characteristic features of human NPC1 disease. Additionally, a feline model of NPC1 disease has been identified, which shares many clinical, biochemical, and pathological features with the human disorder. These animal models are valuable tools for understanding the underlying mechanisms of NPC1 disease and for testing potential therapies.",Yes
Does HER2 under-expression lead to favorable response to trastuzumab?,No,"The evidence suggests that HER2 under-expression does not lead to a favorable response to trastuzumab. In fact, HER2 overexpression is associated with better response to treatment with trastuzumab. The study reveals that engagement of immune effector cells by trastuzumab induces HER2 downregulation in HER2-expressing cancer cells, which represents a new function of immune cells in trastuzumab-mediated antitumor efficacy and serves as a novel mechanism of action for trastuzumab. However, this downregulation only occurs when trastuzumab is actively engaged with immune cells and cancer cells. Furthermore, the reported response rate to trastuzumab is low, and few patients with gastric cancer benefit from this individualized therapy. Therefore, it can be inferred that HER2 under-expression is not a predictor of favorable response to trastuzumab.",Yes
Is the PTPN22 gene a biomarker for rheumatoid arthritis?,Yes,"The PTPN22 gene is a biomarker for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) as it has been associated with an increased risk of developing the disease in several populations. The PTPN22 gene encodes a protein tyrosine phosphatase, and a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in this gene, specifically the 1858C>T SNP, has been identified as a genetic risk factor for RA. This SNP results in the production of a variant protein, R620W, which has been shown to be associated with RA and other autoimmune diseases. The PTPN22 gene is also associated with other inflammatory diseases, and its role in RA is thought to be related to its function in regulating immune cell activity. However, it is important to note that the association between the PTPN22 gene and RA is not present in all populations and may be weaker in some Southern European populations. Nevertheless, the PTPN22 gene is considered a biomarker for RA and is an important target for further research into the genetic basis of this disease.",Yes
Can administration of the thyrotropin releasing hormone reduce fatigue in cancer patients?,Inconclusive,"The administration of the thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH) has been evaluated in the context of determining the serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) response in normal subjects and hypothyroid patients. However, the available information does not provide a direct correlation between TRH administration and fatigue reduction in cancer patients. While TRH stimulates TSH release, which in turn stimulates the production of thyroid hormones, the relationship between TRH and fatigue is not explicitly addressed in the provided context. Therefore, further research is warranted to establish a definitive answer to this question.",Yes
Is curcumin a phytochemical?,Yes,"Curcumin is indeed classified as a phytochemical. Phytochemicals are compounds produced by plants, and they are known to have protective or disease preventive properties. The context provided indicates that curcumin is a natural compound extracted from rhizomes of the Curcuma species, specifically Curcuma longa. It is a polyphenol, which is a type of phytochemical, and is characterized by its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer properties. The use of curcumin in medicinal preparations and as a food colorant further supports its classification as a phytochemical.",Yes
Is Fanconi anemia presented as a genetically and clinically heterogeneous disease entity?,Yes,"Fanconi Anemia is indeed presented as a genetically and clinically heterogeneous disease entity. Genetic heterogeneity is evident due to the presence of mutations in at least 16 different genes involved in DNA repair pathways, leading to diverse clinical manifestations. The disease is characterized by a variety of congenital and skeletal malformations, progressive pancytopenia, and predisposition to malignancies. The molecular diagnosis of Fanconi Anemia is complex due to this genetic heterogeneity, with at least eight distinct complementation groups having been defined. Clinical heterogeneity is also observed, with diverse symptoms including developmental anomalies, predisposition to neoplasia, deficiency of hematopoietic stem cells, and sensitivity to cross-linking agents. The disease is also characterized by a high predisposition to developing malignancies, particularly acute myeloid leukemia.",Yes
Is there evidence for de novo genesis of enhancers in vertebrates?,Yes,"Evidence supports the de novo genesis of enhancers in vertebrates, particularly in fish. Enhancers with non-conserved sequences but homologous functions have been identified, suggesting they originated from a common ancestral sequence. Approximately 20% of these enhancers arose in the mammalian stem lineage, coinciding with the emergence of the neocortex. The de novo generation of enhancers from non-regulatory/non-mobile sequences has been demonstrated, challenging current models that rely on conserved binding sites for cross-species enhancer function. Selection on function, rather than sequence, may be a common mode of enhancer evolution. These findings highlight the role of minor changes in non-regulatory sequences in generating new enhancers and regulatory variability, contributing to evolutionary innovation.",No
Is TNNI3K a cardiac-specific protein?,Yes,"TNNI3K, or cardiac troponin I-interacting kinase, is a novel cardiac-specific kinase whose biological function remains largely unknown. The gene encoding TNNI3K is localized to 1p31.1 and belongs to a tyrosine kinase-like branch in the kinase tree of the human genome. Immunohistochemical analysis has predominantly localized TNNI3K in the nucleus of cardiac myocytes. Northern blot and 76-tissue array analyses have shown that TNNI3K is highly expressed in the heart, but is undetectable in other tissues. These findings suggest that TNNI3K is indeed a cardiac-specific protein. Furthermore, human genetic variants in TNNI3K have been associated with supraventricular arrhythmias, conduction disease, and cardiomyopathy, highlighting its importance in cardiac physiology and disease.",Yes
Is factor XI deficient in Hemophilia C?,Yes,"Factor XI deficiency is indeed associated with Hemophilia C, also known as inherited factor XI (fXI) deficiency. This condition is an uncommon autosomal recessive disorder characterized by a variable bleeding tendency that typically manifests after trauma or surgery. The deficiency of factor XI, a plasma glycoprotein constituent of the clotting cascade, results in a bleeding diathesis, which is a tendency to bleed excessively. This disorder affects both genders and is usually asymptomatic, manifesting only as postoperative hemorrhage. The poor correlation between the clinical bleeding diathesis in factor XI deficiency and abnormalities in clotting assays that measure intrinsic coagulation brings into question the role of this serine protease in in vivo hemostasis. However, it is clear that deficiency of factor XI leads to an injury-related bleeding disorder.",No
Are EDNRB mutations involved in the development of Hirschsprung disease?,Yes,"The endothelin-b receptor gene (EDNRB) has been identified as a susceptibility gene for Hirschsprung disease (HD). Novel mutant transcripts of EDNRB have been found in lymphoblastoid cells from patients with HD, suggesting that mutations in this gene could be involved in the etiology of the disease. EDNRB mutations have been detected in non-syndromic HD patients with heterozygous forms, and homozygous mutations of EDNRB or the endothelin-3 gene (EDN3) have been reported in HD patients associated with type 2 Waardenburg syndrome. The preferential production of null function EDNRB by RNA editing/splicing could be involved in the pathogenesis of HD. The findings suggest that low-penetrance mutations in EDNRB and other genes, along with the additional presence of the ""Hirschsprung disease haplotype,"" could contribute to the manifestation of the disease. Therefore, EDNRB mutations are involved in the development of Hirschsprung disease.",Yes
Can the apoptosis regulator BAX trigger the release of cytochrome c?,Yes,"The apoptosis regulator BAX has been demonstrated to trigger the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria. Upon apoptosis induction, BAX translocates from the cytosol to mitochondria, where it promotes the release of cytochrome c, a caspase-activating protein. This release is thought to play an important role in the initiation of apoptosis. BAX is known to form pores in the mitochondrial outer membrane, which facilitates the release of cytochrome c. The translocation of BAX to the mitochondria is critical for cytochrome c release, and this process is regulated by p38 MAP kinase. Furthermore, the cleavage of BAX is followed by the release of mitochondrial cytochrome c, activation of caspase-3, and subsequent DNA fragmentation. These findings support the concept that the release of cytochrome c into the cytoplasm can promote the apoptotic process in cells expressing pro-caspase 3. However, it is important to note that cytochrome c release is not sufficient to induce death in all cells, and other cells are resistant to its apoptogenic activity.",Yes
Are optogenetics tools used in the study and treatment of epilepsy?,Yes,"Optogenetics tools have been employed in the study and treatment of epilepsy. These techniques enable the precise control of specific neuronal populations, both spatially and temporally, thereby facilitating the investigation of alterations in excitability disorders such as epilepsy. Optogenetic approaches have shown success in attenuating epileptiform activity in various rodent models of epilepsy, providing proof of principle for their potential as an effective treatment for drug-refractory epilepsies. Furthermore, the global optogenetic activation of mixed interneuron populations has been identified as a promising strategy for developing novel therapeutic approaches for epilepsy. However, the initial action potential generation in principal neurons must be considered in this context. Optogenetic devices are currently in use, and this technology is considered the state-of-the-art method for causal-oriented brain research, with potential applications in the study of epilepsy and neuroprostheses, as well as for studies on neural circuit dynamics.",Yes
Is micro RNA 1 (miR-1) implicated in cardiac arrhythmias?,Yes,"Micro RNA 1 (miR-1) is indeed implicated in cardiac arrhythmias, as evidenced by a multitude of studies. miR-1 plays a critical role in the regulation of numerous biological events, including cardiac electrophysiology and arrhythmia, through a canonical RNA interference mechanism. It has been demonstrated that miR-1 is involved in the occurrence of arrhythmia in many myocardial pathological conditions by post-transcriptionally regulating a variety of ion channels and proteins related to cardiac electrical activity. Changes in the abundance of muscle-specific miR-1 have been implicated in cardiac disease, including arrhythmia and heart failure. Furthermore, miR-1 has been found to accelerate right atrial tachypacing-induced AERP shortening by targeting potassium channel genes, which suggests its significant clinical relevance as a potential therapeutic target for atrial fibrillation.",No
Are there Conserved Noncoding Elements (CNEs) in invertebrate genomes?,Yes,"Justification: Invertebrate genomes, such as those of nematodes, contain an alternative set of conserved noncoding elements (CNEs) that share sequence characteristics, but not identity, with their vertebrate counterparts. The presence of these CNEs in invertebrate genomes suggests that they play a role in gene regulation and development, similar to their function in vertebrate genomes. Although few such conserved elements can be detected between vertebrates and their closest invertebrate relatives, the existence of CNEs in invertebrate genomes has been reported. Therefore, it can be concluded that there are CNEs in invertebrate genomes.",Yes
Does thyroid hormone signaling affect microRNAs expression in the heart?,Yes,"Thyroid hormone signaling indeed affects microRNA expression in the heart. Recent studies have identified 39 differentially expressed microRNAs in the heart, with mir-142-5p, mir-142-3p, and mir-146a being highly expressed in the thyroid gland. The thyroid hormone receptor, thrÎ², plays a crucial role in regulating specific mRNAs and microRNAs in T3-induced cardiac hypertrophic growth and in altering heart functions. These findings suggest that thyroid hormone signaling is not only critical for heart function but also modulates gene expression, including microRNAs, in the heart.",Yes
Do all archaea possess multiple origins of DNA replication?,No,"The claim that all archaea possess multiple origins of DNA replication is not supported by the available evidence. While the majority of archaea species characterized thus far do possess chromosomes with multiple replication origins, some archaea have been found to replicate from a single origin, similar to bacteria. This diversity in DNA replication initiation mechanisms is a notable feature of archaea, and further research is needed to fully understand the use and control of multiple replication origins in this domain of life.",Yes
Is p100 the precursor protein molecule of the NF-kappaB transcription factor subunit p50?,No,"Justification: The p100 precursor protein is not the precursor of the p50 subunit of the NF-kappaB transcription factor. Instead, the p105 precursor protein is the precursor of the p50 subunit. The p100 precursor protein is involved in the generation of the p52 subunit of the NF-kappaB transcription factor through proteolytic processing. Both p50 and p65 subunits together form the NF-kappaB transcription factor complex, which plays a crucial role in the inducible expression of diverse cellular genes.",Yes
Is there a difference in the rate between gene fusion and gene fission?,Insufficient,"Information

The context does not provide specific rates for gene fusion and gene fission, making it impossible to determine if there is a difference in the rates between these two processes. However, it does highlight the importance of both gene fusion and gene fission in the evolution of new genes and the development of new functions for existing genes. Gene fusion involves the joining of two adjacent genes into a single gene, while gene fission involves the splitting of a single gene into two separate genes. Both processes can result from genomic rearrangements, such as deletions, amplifications, and translocations. The context also notes that gene fission may play a more significant role in gene evolution than previously thought, suggesting that it may occur more frequently than gene fusion. However, more research is needed to determine the specific rates of gene fusion and gene fission and whether there is a difference between them.",Yes
Can cognitive behavioral therapy improve fatigue in cancer patients?,Yes,"Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) has been demonstrated to significantly reduce fatigue in cancer patients. Numerous studies, including Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs), have shown that CBT is effective in managing fatigue in both adult and childhood cancer survivors, as well as in patients undergoing curative and palliative cancer treatments. CBT has been found to be particularly effective in addressing severe fatigue in cancer patients, with patients reporting less cognitive disability after treatment. Furthermore, CBT has been shown to improve fatigue and functional outcomes in patients with post-cancer fatigue, through changes in behavior and cognitions about fatigue and cancer. Therefore, CBT is a clinically relevant intervention for reducing fatigue and improving functional impairments in cancer survivors.",No
Is protein Fbw7 a SCF type of E3 ubiquitin ligase?,No,"Protein Fbw7 is not a SCF type of E3 ubiquitin ligase, but rather a substrate recognition component of an evolutionary conserved SCF (complex of skp1, cul1 and f-box protein)-type ubiquitin ligase. Fbw7, also known as fbxw7, hcdc4, and sel-10, is an F-box protein that functions as the substrate recognition component of the SCF-type E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. This complex targets several oncoproteins for ubiquitination and degradation by the proteasome. Fbw7 is one of the most well-characterized F-box proteins that serve as substrate recognition subunits of SCF (skp1-cullin 1-f-box proteins) E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes. The SCF(Fbw7) ubiquitin ligase complex plays important roles in cell growth, survival, and differentiation via the ubiquitin-proteasome-mediated regulation of protein stability. F-box proteins determine the substrate specificities of SCF ubiquitin ligases.",Yes
Is there increased incidence of incontinence in athletes?,Yes,"Scientific evidence indicates a higher prevalence of urinary incontinence among female athletes, particularly those engaged in high-impact sports. The reported prevalence of urinary incontinence among athletes is significantly higher than in control subjects (28% vs 9.8%, p = .001). Furthermore, the risk of urinary incontinence increases with the duration and intensity of athletic activity. High school female athletes exhibit a higher rate of athletic incontinence (34.15%) compared to previous studies of college-age athletes. The prevalence of urinary incontinence is particularly high in sports such as basketball (16.6%), athletics (15%), and tennis or squash (11%). Additionally, factors such as eating disorders and the use of hormonal contraception may further increase the risk of urinary incontinence in athletes.",No
Are there enhancer RNAs (eRNAs)?,Yes,"Enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) are a class of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) that are transcribed from the DNA sequences of enhancer regions. These non-coding RNAs are thought to play a role in transcriptional regulation by acting as potent promoters of the expression of nearby genes. eRNAs are generated from active enhancers, which are major types of cis-regulatory elements in the genome. The transcription of eRNAs is carried out by RNA polymerase II, and the resulting transcripts are bi-directional and non-coding. Recent studies have shown that eRNAs have a regulatory function and play a role in controlling mRNA transcription, challenging the idea that enhancers are merely sites of transcription factor assembly. eRNAs are also associated with various complex traits and characteristics and are thought to play important roles in gene regulation. Emerging evidence suggests that eRNAs may play critical roles in regulating gene expression in human cancers.",Yes
Are conserved noncoding elements associated with the evolution of animal body plans?,Yes,"Justification: Conserved non-coding elements (CNEs) have been identified in the genomes of various animal species, including vertebrates, flies, and nematodes. These elements are unusually enriched for highly conserved non-coding sequence elements, which are involved in vertebrate development. Recent evidence supports the proposal that the observed diversity of animal body plans has been produced through alterations to the complexity of the regulatory genome, rather than increases in the protein-coding content of a genome. CNEs are thought to play a key role in morphological and physiological diversity across animals, as they are part of the core gene regulatory networks (GRNs) that specify alternative animal body plans. The strong conservation of these sequences may affect the evolution of the surrounding genome, both by repressing rearrangement and possibly by promoting duplicate gene retention. Given that many developmental processes are strikingly similar across all backboned animals, it is reasonable to expect these sequences to be conserved at the nucleotide level, their potential for mutation being constrained by their function. The discovery that most regulatory genes were conserved among animals from distant phyla challenged the ideas that gene duplication and divergence of homologous coding sequences were the basis for major morphological changes in metazoan evolution. Non-coding RNAs also play roles in embryonic development of animals, and their functions might be expected to evolve rapidly. Our results indicate that prototypical UCEs originated before the divergence of jawed and jawless vertebrates and have been frozen as perfect conserved sequences in the jawed vertebrate lineage.",Yes
Are DNA methylation maps applicable to the diagnosis of non-small-cell lung carcinomas?,Yes,"The application of DNA methylation maps for the diagnosis of non-small cell lung carcinomas (NSCLC) is supported by substantial evidence. Aberrant DNA methylation is frequently observed in NSCLC, and several studies have identified specific genes (e.g., cdkn2a, rarÎ², and rassf1a) that exhibit significantly higher methylation frequencies in tumors compared to non-cancerous lung tissues. These findings suggest that DNA methylation profiles can be used to distinguish different histological types of lung cancer from normal tissue. Furthermore, the development of a panel of DNA methylation biomarkers and their validation in a large retrospective cohort of NSCLC patients provides compelling evidence for their diagnostic efficiency. The identification of novel methylation driver genes and the feasibility of methylation quantification in bronchial aspirates and lymph node samples further support the potential of DNA methylation maps as noninvasive biomarkers for NSCLC diagnosis.",Yes
Is the protein product of the cylindromatosis gene (CYLD) a deubiquitinating enzyme?,Yes,"The protein product of the cylindromatosis gene (CYLD) is indeed a deubiquitinating enzyme. This enzyme plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, cell survival, and inflammatory responses. It achieves this primarily by inhibiting the NF-ÎºB signaling pathway. The deubiquitinating activity of CYLD is essential for its function as a tumor suppressor. Loss of this activity is associated with tumorigenesis. Furthermore, CYLD has been shown to regulate the proliferation, development, and activation of lymphoid cells. It is also a negative regulator of the JNK signaling pathway. Therefore, it is clear that CYLD is a deubiquitinating enzyme with significant implications in both normal physiological processes and disease conditions.",Yes
Has the presence of delayed enhancement been documented in athletes performing strenuous exercise?,No,"The presence of delayed enhancement has not been explicitly documented in the provided context for athletes performing strenuous exercise. Delayed enhancement is a term typically associated with cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, which is not mentioned in the context. The context focuses on the impact of acute physical exercise on athletes' perceptual-cognitive performance, decision-making skills, and exercise-induced hypoxemia. It also discusses the effects of high-intensity exercise on performance during severe-intensity exercise and the variable responses to short-term periods of increased training load in endurance athletes. However, there is no mention of delayed enhancement in relation to strenuous exercise.",Yes
Is triadin involved in cardiac function?,Yes,"Triadin is a protein that is expressed in cardiac and skeletal muscle and has an essential role in the regulation of calcium release units and excitation-contraction coupling. It forms a quaternary complex with the ryanodine receptor, junctin, and calsequestrin, which are important for calcium release. The stable expression of triadin, independent of junctin expression, results in cardiac hypertrophy, prolonged basal relaxation, a depressed response to beta-adrenergic agonists, and altered calcium transients. These results suggest an important role for triadin in regulating the contractile properties of the heart during excitation-contraction coupling. The maintenance of triadin expression is essential for normal sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium cycling and contractile function. Therefore, triadin is involved in cardiac function.",Yes
Is Mammaprint approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration?,Yes,Mammaprint is a microarray-based gene expression test that has been cleared by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This test is used to assess the recurrence risk in early-stage breast cancer and guide physicians in making neoadjuvant and adjuvant treatment decisions. Mammaprint is a 70-gene signature microarray assay that predicts the likelihood of recurrence of breast cancer and chemotherapeutic benefits. The test has been extensively validated and cleared by the FDA for use in both fresh and formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue. Mammaprint is the only test cleared by the FDA for the prognostication of early breast cancer. The test has shown significant prognostic performance at 5 and 10 years of follow-up.,Yes
Is HER2 active only when it dimerizes?,Yes,"HER2 activity is contingent upon dimerization, as evidenced by the requirement of dimerization for the autophosphorylation of tyrosine residues within its cytoplasmic domain. This process, in turn, triggers the hyperactivation of several downstream signal transduction pathways that play a crucial role in tumorigenesis, cancer aggressiveness, and cell proliferation. Furthermore, the dimerization of HER2 can occur spontaneously, especially under conditions of overexpression, which is a commonly encountered phenomenon in breast cancer. The heterodimerization of HER2 with other members of the epidermal growth factor receptor family, such as HER1, HER3, or HER4, also activates the HER2 signaling pathway. Conformational changes in the HER2 activation loop, which are measured by changes in carboxyl group labeling, necessitate both dimerization and nucleotide binding but do not necessitate activation loop phosphorylation at Tyr-877. These findings underscore the importance of dimerization in HER2 activity and signaling.",Yes
Are microRNA (miR) regulated through DNA methylation of their promoters?,Yes,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are indeed regulated through DNA methylation of their promoters. This epigenetic regulation is a critical mechanism that influences miRNA expression. DNA methylation, specifically at CpG islands in miRNA promoter regions, can inhibit miRNA transcription, similar to its effect on coding genes. Studies have shown that a subset of miRNAs is epigenetically regulated by DNA methylation, with approximately 6.9% of known mature miRNAs exhibiting this regulation. This process is not unidirectional, as certain miRNAs can also target DNA methyltransferases, thereby affecting the whole genome methylation pattern. This intricate interplay between miRNAs and DNA methylation underscores their role in gene regulation and their potential implications in human diseases, including cancer.",Yes
Are nucleosomes positioned at DNA replication origins?,Yes,"Nucleosomes are indeed positioned at DNA replication origins. Evidence suggests that nucleosomes are positioned adjacent to the origin, with a nucleosome-depleted region centered next to the ACS element. This nucleosomal organization influences two steps of replication initiation: origin licensing and helicase activation. The origin recognition complex, which binds to the origin, acts as a barrier element to position and phase nucleosomes on both sides of the origin. The positioning of nucleosomes regulates the access of DNA binding factors to their consensus sequences. The precise locations of the DNA sequences that control origin function are crucial to understanding the exact features of chromatin that impinge on replication origin function.",Yes
Does nimotuzumab improve survival of glioblastoma patients?,Inconclusive,"The efficacy of nimotuzumab in improving survival for glioblastoma patients is currently under investigation. A randomized, open-label phase III trial was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of nimotuzumab in combination with standard therapy for newly diagnosed glioblastoma. However, the results of this trial have not been explicitly mentioned in the provided context. Therefore, it is not possible to definitively conclude that nimotuzumab improves survival for glioblastoma patients based solely on the information given. Further research and analysis are needed to determine the true impact of nimotuzumab on survival outcomes in this patient population.",No
Is there a relation between ANP and transcapillary albumin escape?,Yes,"Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) infusion significantly increases the transcapillary escape rate of intravascular albumin, as demonstrated by a greater escape during ANP infusion than during saline control (p < 0.05). This effect is observed in various organs, including the gastrointestinal tract, skeletal muscle, heart, and lungs. The increase in albumin escape rate during ANP infusion is likely due to alterations in glomerular permeability. Furthermore, ANP causes plasma fluid to shift out of the circulation, which enhances the escape of radiolabeled albumin. These findings suggest a direct relationship between ANP and transcapillary albumin escape, with ANP playing a role in the escape phenomenon.",Yes
Can chronological age be predicted by measuring telomere length?,Yes,", with limitations.

Justification: The measurement of telomere length is indicative of biological age and can assess the lifespan of a cell. Telomere length significantly decreases with age, and mean leukocyte telomere length may be an indicator of biological age, providing information over and above chronological age. However, the relationship between telomere length and chronological age is dependent on age and other factors such as gender. The rate of telomere shortening and telomere length in the first year of life independently predict lifespan, with individuals with faster shortening rates and/or shorter telomeres living less long. Therefore, while telomere length can be used to predict chronological age, it is not a perfect indicator and should be used in conjunction with other biomarkers of aging.",No
Is there an association between c-reactive protein concentrations and outcomes of subarachnoid hemorrhage patients?,Yes,"The evidence suggests that there is an association between c-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations and outcomes of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) patients. Multiple studies have shown a correlation between CRP and mortality in spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage. Furthermore, a review and meta-analysis investigated the associations of CRP and white blood cell count (WBC) with the occurrence of delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) and poor functional outcome after aneurysmal SAH. The study also suggests that h24-CRP may be a more reliable marker than initial CRP in predicting mortality in intracerebral hemorrhage. Additionally, the association of CRP with clinical outcomes after acute ischemic stroke remains uncertain, but only h24-CRP, hematoma volume, and infratentorial origin were independently associated with 30-day mortality in intracerebral hemorrhage. The study also found that high-sensitivity CRP (hs-CRP) is a well-recognized biomarker of neurologic complications and clinical outcome in stroke patients. Overall, the evidence supports the association between CRP concentrations and outcomes of SAH patients.",Yes
Can RNASeq be used for the analysis of nascent transcripts?,Yes,"RNA-Seq, a next-generation sequencing based method, has emerged as a powerful tool for comprehensive transcript abundance estimation. It allows for the detection and accurate quantification of RNA molecules originating from a genome at a given moment in time. The profiling of nascent transcripts, which often include nonpolyadenylated RNAs, can unveil novel insights into transcriptional regulation. Furthermore, nascent RNA-Seq detects post-cleavage RNA at termination sites and promoter-associated antisense RNAs, providing insights into RNA polymerase II dynamics and processivity. Unlike steady-state RNA-sequencing, nascent RNA profiling mirrors real-time activity of RNA polymerases and provides an accurate readout of transcriptome-wide variations. Therefore, RNA-Seq can indeed be used for the analysis of nascent transcripts.",Yes
Do RNA:DNA hybrids preferentially form in high or low GC regions?,Yes,"RNA:DNA hybrids preferentially form in high GC regions. GC-rich sequences have a higher propensity to form stem-loop structures, which facilitate the annealing of RNA transcripts to the DNA template strand or homologous DNA regions. The presence of GC skew in thousands of human CpG island promoters and transcription termination regions, which correspond to hotspots of R-loop formation, further supports this preference. The sequence-dependent melting temperatures and circular dichroism spectra of S-DNA:RNA hybrids also reflect the unique nearest-neighbor interactions of adjacent base pairs, indicating a preference for GC-rich sequences.",Yes
Are shadow enhancers associated with development?,Yes,"Shadow enhancers are indeed associated with development, as they play a critical role in the regulation of gene expression during complex developmental processes. These seemingly redundant transcriptional cis-regulatory elements regulate the same gene and drive overlapping expression patterns. Shadow enhancers are found in a wide range of organisms, including invertebrates and vertebrates, and are remarkably abundant, controlling most developmental gene expression. They are critical for robust developmental patterning, fostering robustness in gene expression in response to environmental or genetic perturbations. Shadow enhancers can interact in complex ways and may also help to drive the formation of transcriptional hubs within the nucleus. Each shadow enhancer is regulated by different transcription factors, and they can be located in remote positions, including the introns of neighboring genes. The prevalence and evolutionary conservation of shadow enhancers underscore their key role in emerging metazoan gene regulatory networks.",Yes
Does prudent diet reduce cardiovascular risk?,Yes,"Evidence suggests that adherence to a prudent diet, characterized by high consumption of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins, is associated with reduced risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Epidemiological findings indicate that individuals who follow a healthy dietary pattern have a lower risk of CVD and metabolic syndrome. Furthermore, a systematic review aimed to investigate the effects of dietary advice on cardiovascular outcomes in generally healthy adults without existing CVD or increased risk factors. The review found that individual changes in dietary behavior have the potential to decrease the burden of chronic disease, particularly CVD. In addition, a study found that participants with the greatest improvement in diet quality scores had a 7% to 8% lower CVD risk in the subsequent 4-year period compared to those whose diet quality remained relatively stable. These findings suggest that a heart-healthy dietary pattern is associated with moderately reduced risk of CVD.",Yes
Is Crohn's disease (CD) linked to the consumption of refrigerated food?,Yes,"Recent evidence suggests a potential association between Crohn's disease (CD) and exposure to domestic refrigeration during childhood. While the exact cause of CD remains unknown, it is a chronic inflammatory condition of diverse etiology, and diet is believed to play a significant role in its pathogenesis and clinical course. In a pilot case-control study, patients with CD were found to have been exposed to refrigerators earlier than controls (p = 0.04), with refrigerator exposure at birth identified as a risk factor for CD (OR = 2.08, 95% CI: 1.01-4.29, p = 0.05). These findings, along with the increasing incidence of CD over the past fifty years, warrant further investigation into the potential link between CD and refrigerated food consumption.",Yes
Are there Conserved Noncoding Elements (CNEs) in plant genomes?,Yes,"Justification: Conserved noncoding elements (CNEs) have been identified in plant genomes, which are evolutionarily conserved DNA sequences that do not encode proteins but may have potential regulatory roles in gene expression. These CNEs, also known as conserved noncoding sequences (CNSs), are shorter in plants compared to those found in vertebrates. CNSs in plants have been shown to function experimentally and are enriched significantly in regulatory sequence elements. Additionally, CNSs have been detected throughout the eudicot clade of flowering plants, and a subset of 37 CNSs can be found in all flowering plants, indicating their conservation over approximately 170 million years of evolution. These CNSs serve as reliable pointers to regulatory elements controlling gene expression and may be linked to important agronomic traits and ecological adaptations in crop genomes.",Yes
Can tetracycline affect tooth formation?,Yes,"Tetracycline has been shown to affect tooth formation through several mechanisms. In developing teeth, tetracycline can be incorporated into the enamel and dentin, causing discoloration and hypoplasia. This occurs due to physiochemical processes that may take place regardless of the developmental stage of the mineralized tissues. Tetracycline solutions, which are acidic, can cause demineralization of enamel and dentin, as well as the incorporation of fluorescent material into these tissues. Furthermore, tetracyclines react with dental hard tissues to form long-lasting antimicrobial compounds, which can have a retarding effect on pellicle and plaque formation and an antienzymatic effect. There is also a direct relation between the presence of developmental defects of enamel and the degree of discoloration induced by tetracycline. Chronic sun exposure of the incorporated tetracycline may cause the formation of a reddish-purple oxidation product, resulting in discoloration of the permanent teeth.",No
Does Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) have anti-inflammatory activity?,Yes,"Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) exhibits potent anti-inflammatory effects, which contribute to its protective role against atherosclerosis and other inflammatory diseases. ApoE's anti-inflammatory properties are mediated by its ability to modulate the central nervous system (CNS) inflammatory response and regulate cellular microRNA levels in leukocytes. Furthermore, ApoE's anti-atherogenic properties are partially attributed to its anti-inflammatory effects, which are independent of its role in lipid metabolism. ApoE's anti-inflammatory activity is also associated with its ability to modulate the systemic type I inflammatory response in vivo and regulate plasma cholesterol homeostasis. Overall, ApoE's anti-inflammatory activity represents a novel anti-atherogenic activity that contributes to its protective role against atherosclerosis.",Yes
Is the ACE inhibitor indicated for lung cancer treatment?,No,"The ACE inhibitor is not indicated for lung cancer treatment based on the available evidence. Despite the detection of significant lung cancer signals among patients who received ACEI, especially female patients, the association between ACE inhibitors and lung cancer needs further evaluation due to conflicting data. Although some studies suggest that ACE inhibitors may decrease the risk of some cancers, including lung cancer, the evidence is not conclusive. Furthermore, the use of ACE inhibitors is primarily indicated for the treatment of systolic heart failure, and their potential role in lung cancer treatment remains unclear. Therefore, it is not appropriate to recommend ACE inhibitors for lung cancer treatment at this time.",Yes
Are genes symmetrically distributed between leading and lagging DNA strand in bacteria?,No,"In bacteria, genes are not symmetrically distributed between the leading and lagging strands of DNA. This asymmetry, known as strand bias, is widespread in bacterial genomes and is characterized by a preference for genes to be encoded on the leading strand. This phenomenon is attributed to collisions between DNA and RNA polymerases, which are more likely to occur when genes are located on the lagging strand. Additionally, the nucleotide compositions of most bacteria differ between the leading and lagging strands, with a strong bias for Gs over Cs on the leading strand. The direction of the A/T skew is determined by the polymerase-alpha subunit that replicates the leading strand. Furthermore, asymmetrical replication forks may have a major role in defining and constraining the structure of the bacterial chromosome. These findings suggest that the distribution of genes between the leading and lagging strands is not random, but rather influenced by a variety of factors that contribute to strand bias.",Yes
Is c-myc subject to regulation by the circadian clock?,Yes,"The expression of cell cycle genes, such as c-myc, are under circadian control and could be directly regulated by the circadian transcriptional complex. The circadian clock plays a critical role in physiology and medicine by cyclically regulating the expression of numerous genes, including those involved in the cell cycle. The molecular machinery that governs circadian rhythmicity comprises proteins whose interplay generates time-specific transcription of clock genes. The daily organization of most mammalian cellular functions is attributed to circadian regulation of clock-controlled protein expression, driven by daily cycles of cryptochrome-dependent transcriptional feedback repression. Circadian genes continue to gain attention as important transcriptional regulators with the potential to influence a variety of biological pathways, including many cancer-related processes. Therefore, it can be inferred that c-myc is subject to regulation by the circadian clock.",Yes
is there an increase in ultrasound comets after intense exercise?,Yes,"Justification: The context suggests that lung ultrasound comets, or ""comet-tail"" artifacts, are indicative of increased extravascular lung water. The presence of these ultrasound lung comets has been correlated with adverse clinical events in dialysis patients and has been observed in patients with normal left and right ventricular function and pulmonary artery systolic pressure rise. The context also mentions that various lung ultrasound scanning modalities have been proposed for the detection of b-lines, also referred to as ultrasound lung comets, which are an important indication of extravascular lung water at rest and after exercise stress echo (ese). The ""comet-tail"" sign is detectable with ultrasound chest instruments and consists of multiple comet-tails fanning out from the lung surface. The context also suggests that these comets fluctuate substantially during the ultrasound exam, highlighting the need for objective quantitative measurement methods. Given that intense exercise can lead to increased extravascular lung water, it is reasonable to infer that there may be an increase in ultrasound comets after intense exercise.",No
Can cffDNA be used for non-invasive testing?,Yes,"Cell-free fetal DNA (cffDNA) has emerged as a valuable tool in non-invasive prenatal testing. It is increasingly used in prenatal care for early prenatal diagnoses, offering a non-invasive alternative to traditional invasive methods such as amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling (CVS). The detection of cffDNA in maternal plasma has given rise to new non-invasive approaches for prenatal diagnoses. Circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) is a promising tool among all components of liquid biopsy, with great potential for non-invasive diagnostics, prognosis, and monitoring treatment of various diseases. CffDNA testing has become indispensable in diagnostic testing and screening, providing an effective and lower-risk alternative to invasive methods. It has been studied extensively for non-invasive prenatal testing, cancer screening, and monitoring of tumors. The feasibility and accuracy of non-invasive fetal gender determination using cffDNA have been evaluated, demonstrating its potential as a valuable biomarker for non-invasive prenatal diagnosis.",Yes
Is the UGT1A1*28 polymorphism associated with irinotecan response in Caucasians?,Yes,"The UGT1A1*28 polymorphism has been shown to have an effect on irinotecan-induced toxicities in Caucasians, as demonstrated in previous pharmacogenetic studies. This polymorphism is also known as a biomarker of irinotecan-induced neutropenia in Caucasians. The UGT1A1*28 polymorphism has been found to have a significant relationship with both toxicity and response to irinotecan-based chemotherapy. Furthermore, the UGT1A1*28 polymorphism is considered the main pharmacogenetic predictor of the toxicity outcome of irinotecan-treated patients. The UGT1A1*28 polymorphism reduces UGT1A1 enzyme activity, which may lead to severe toxicities in patients who receive irinotecan. Therefore, it can be concluded that the UGT1A1*28 polymorphism is associated with irinotecan response in Caucasians.",Yes
Do U6-associated proteins Lsm4 and Lsm6 interact with SMN?,No,"The context does not provide explicit information about the interaction between U6-associated proteins Lsm4 and Lsm6 with SMN. However, it does mention that a complex of seven Lsm proteins (Lsm2-8) interacts with the U6 snRNA and functions in splicing. Additionally, seven Lsm proteins co-immunoprecipitate with Lsm4 (Uss1p), suggesting an interaction between Lsm4 and other Lsm proteins. Nevertheless, the context does not provide any evidence for the interaction of Lsm4 and Lsm6 with SMN. Therefore, based on the given context, it is not possible to confirm that U6-associated proteins Lsm4 and Lsm6 interact with SMN.",Yes
Does MVIIA and MVIIC bind to the same calcium channel?,No,"Omega-conotoxin MVIIC binds to p/q-type calcium channels with high affinity and n-type channels with low affinity. Despite their high sequence homology, MVIIC selectively blocks p/q-type calcium channels, while MVIIA selectively blocks n-type calcium channels. This indicates that MVIIC and MVIIA do not bind to the same calcium channel with high affinity, as they have different binding preferences. Additionally, the binding sites for MVIIC and MVIID on calcium channels have characteristics that differ considerably from those described to occur in the brain, suggesting that they may represent a new subtype of voltage-dependent high-threshold calcium channels.",Yes
Is arimoclomol a co-inducer of the heat shock response?,Yes,"Arimoclomol, a hydroxylamine derivative, belongs to a group of compounds known for their unique properties as co-inducers of heat shock protein expression. However, this co-inducing effect is only observed under conditions of cellular stress. The compound amplifies heat shock protein gene expression during cell stress, acting as an amplifier of heat shock protein expression involved in the cellular stress response. The novel hydroxylamine derivative, bimoclomol, which is closely related to arimoclomol, has been shown to act as a co-inducer of several heat shock proteins, enhancing the amount of these proteins produced following a heat shock compared to heat shock alone. The co-inducing effect of bimoclomol on heat shock protein expression is mediated via the prolonged activation of the heat shock transcription factor (HSF-1). Given the similarities between arimoclomol and bimoclomol, it can be inferred that arimoclomol also acts as a co-inducer of the heat shock response.",Yes
Has silicon been used in treatment of  incontinence ?,Yes,"Silicone, specifically in the form of liquid injectable silicone, has been employed in medical applications for over five decades. While it has been primarily used for soft tissue augmentation, it has also been utilized in the treatment of certain medical conditions. In a specific case, a 24-year-old man with vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) and renal insufficiency was treated by endoscopic injection of silicone. Although this case does not directly address incontinence, it demonstrates the use of silicone in treating urological conditions. Given the wide use of silicone in medical practice, including as an implantable device and in reconstructive surgery, it is reasonable to infer that silicone may have been used in the treatment of incontinence, although further research would be needed to confirm this.",Yes
Does the 3D structure of  the genome remain stable during cell differentiation?,No,"The three-dimensional (3D) structure of the genome does not remain stable during cell differentiation. In fact, the 3D structure of the genome varies significantly from cell to cell, even in isogenic samples. This variation is due to the fact that the eukaryotic genome adopts a 3D configuration in the cell nucleus that varies with cell types, developmental stages, and environmental conditions. The 3D organization of the genome is also intimately related to numerous key biological functions, including gene expression and DNA replication regulations. The observation that 3D domains correlate strongly with 1D epigenomic information along the genome suggests a dynamic coupling between chromatin organization and epigenetic regulation. Furthermore, the 3D organization of the genome is expected to play critical roles in regulating genome functions, including gene regulation, replication, and repair. The mechanisms by which molecular drivers functionally organize the 3D genome, such as topologically associating domains (TADs), remain to be explored. However, it is clear that the 3D structure of the genome is a dynamic feature that is closely tied to cellular differentiation and function.",No
Does dronedarone  affect  T3 and T4 levels?,Yes,"Dronedarone treatment has been shown to affect T3 and T4 levels. The drug induces hyperthyroidism at the early stage and hypothyroidism at the late stage. In contrast, amiodarone only causes hypothyroidism. Dronedarone administration in Wistar rats resulted in a decrease in intracellular T3 levels in all tissues, an increase in T4 levels in most tissues, and a greater increase in the RT3 concentration. Analysis of serum TH levels showed a reduction of T4 in group P, while half of the animals also displayed ""low T3"" values on day 14. The drug has been shown to preferentially antagonize thyroid hormone binding to thyroid hormone receptor alpha1 (TRalpha1), which may contribute to its effects on T3 and T4 levels.",Yes
Does triiodothyronine (T3) has cardiac angiogenic effects?,Inconclusive,"Triiodothyronine (T3) has been shown to increase cardiac contractility and improve left ventricular performance. It has also been demonstrated to induce the activation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase via PI3K/Akt non-genomic signaling, which is known to play a role in angiogenesis. However, the direct angiogenic effects of T3 on the heart have not been explicitly studied or reported. Therefore, it is currently inconclusive whether T3 has cardiac angiogenic effects. Further research is needed to determine the potential angiogenic effects of T3 on the heart.",Yes
Is the HRC Ser96Ala variant associated with sudden cardiac death in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy?,Yes,"The HRC Ser96Ala variant has been identified as a potential biomarker for ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death in patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. This genetic variant is linked to an increased propensity of arrhythmogenic Ca(2+) waves in the stressed failing heart, suggesting a connection between this genetic variant and life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias in human carriers. The mutation has been associated with sudden death at any age and dilated cardiomyopathy-like features in those aged >40 years. The HRC Ser96Ala variant leads to an increase in spontaneous Ca(2+) release and ultimately arrhythmias by disrupting the regulation of intra-store free Ca(2+). These findings support the association between the HRC Ser96Ala variant and sudden cardiac death in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy.",No
Are BRAF mutations common in melanoma?,Yes,"BRAF mutations are indeed a common finding in malignant melanoma. The context suggests that approximately 50% of melanomas harbor activating BRAF mutations. These mutations were identified in 46.7% of primary melanomas and 48.7% of metastatic melanomas. The BRAF(V600E) mutation, in particular, was found in 63.0% of melanomas. The frequency of BRAF mutations was significantly higher in metastatic lesions compared to primary melanomas. These findings indicate that BRAF mutations are not only common but also play a significant role in the development and progression of melanoma.",Yes
Is it possible to determine the proteome of a formalin fixed and paraffin embedded  (FFPE) tissue?,Yes,"Recent advancements in clinical proteomics have enabled the investigation of the proteome of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues, despite the challenges posed by the high level of covalently crosslinked proteins due to formalin fixation. Shotgun proteomics, a mass spectrometry-based approach, has shown feasibility in characterizing FFPE tissue proteins. The use of FFPE tissues for protein profiling has significant potential for the discovery and validation of disease biomarkers, as they represent a rich source of clinically relevant material. However, it is important to note that the proteomic analysis of FFPE tissues requires robust approaches for tandem mass spectrometry-based identification of proteins due to the complexities introduced by formalin fixation.",Yes
Is aganglionic megacolon a feature of Down syndrome?,Yes,"Aganglionic megacolon, also known as Hirschsprung's disease, is indeed a feature that has been observed more frequently in patients with Down syndrome. This disorder is characterized by the absence of ganglion cells in the distal bowel, leading to a functional obstruction and subsequent dilation of the colon, a condition known as megacolon. Down syndrome, the most common chromosomal anomaly in humans, is associated with an increased incidence of anorectal anomalies, including aganglionosis. The context suggests that Hirschsprung's disease has been seen more often among patients with Down syndrome, indicating a possible association between the two conditions. However, further research is needed to fully understand the nature of this association.",No
Does HuR protein regulate the splicing process?,Yes,"The HuR protein, a member of the embryonic lethal abnormal vision/Hu protein family, plays a critical role in regulating gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. This protein associates with numerous transcripts, both coding and noncoding, and controls their splicing, localization, stability, and translation. The HuR protein is increasingly recognized as a pivotal posttranscriptional regulator of gene expression, and its role in pre-mRNA splicing has been well characterized. Furthermore, recent studies have validated thousands of RNAs that interact with HuR in the pathways of RNA splicing and stability. Therefore, it can be concluded that the HuR protein does regulate the splicing process.",Yes
Is Titin the largest single protein molecule found in Nature?,Yes,"Titin, also known as connectin, is the largest single polypeptide discovered in nature thus far. It is encoded by the ttn gene and is primarily found in the thick filament of vertebrate muscles. With a relative molecular mass of approximately 3 x 10^6, titin is a giant protein that plays a critical role in passive and active muscle function. It is responsible for muscle elasticity and provides a scaffold for several sarcomeric proteins. The global and local structure and function of titin are still largely undiscovered, but it is known to be composed of hundreds of individually folded globular domains. Therefore, based on current knowledge, titin can be considered the largest single protein molecule found in nature.",No
Can clonidine be used to reduce agitation in children.,Yes,"Clonidine has been shown to be effective in reducing the risk of post-sevoflurane agitation in children, with a significant decrease in the incidence of agitation and severe agitation in the clonidine group compared to the placebo group. Additionally, clonidine has been suggested as an alternative pharmacotherapy for patients with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and comorbid tic disorders. Clonidine has also been shown to be an effective preanesthetic medication in children, providing a preoperative sedative effect. These findings suggest that clonidine may be a useful adjunct for reducing agitation in children. However, it is important to note that the current level of evidence is limited and further research is needed to fully understand the efficacy and safety of clonidine in this population.",Yes
Does ventriculoperitoneal shunt improve normal pressure hydrocephalus?,Yes,", with caveats

     The Ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt is the most common treatment for idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH). The procedure involves the insertion of a shunt to divert excess cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from the brain, thereby alleviating symptoms associated with iNPH, such as gait disturbance, dementia, and urinary incontinence. While VP shunting is the gold standard treatment for hydrocephalus, it is not without complications, including catheter obstruction and infection.

     The impact of VP shunting on cognition in iNPH patients has been inconsistent, with some studies reporting significant improvements in memory and other cognitive functions, while others have found no significant changes. However, patients with iNPH who show clinical improvement (in any symptom) after lumbar drainage are likely to show significant long-term improvement in memory after VP shunt insertion.

     In summary, while VP shunting is the most common treatment for iNPH and can improve symptoms, its impact on cognition is not fully understood, and further research is needed to determine its long-term effects.",Yes
Does Serca2a bind PLN in the heart?,Yes,"Justification: The context suggests that phospholamban (PLN) and sarcolipin (SLN) are endogenous regulators of SERCA2a, a key player in cardiac muscle contractility. PLN regulates SERCA2a via its ser(16)-phosphorylation, while SLN inhibits SERCA2a through direct binding. In the absence of PLN, overexpression of NF-SLN can inhibit SERCA2a. This implies that PLN and SERCA2a interact physically, as evidenced by the increased physical interaction between the two proteins in PUGNAC-treated cardiomyocytes. Therefore, it can be inferred that SERCA2a binds PLN in the heart.",Yes
Is there any role for long noncoding RNAs in adipogenesis?,Yes,"Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) indeed play a significant role in adipogenesis, the process of fat cell differentiation and tissue development. They have been identified as crucial factors for modulating adipogenic differentiation and have emerged as powerful regulators of adipocyte differentiation and gene expression. LncRNAs have been implicated in a range of developmental processes and diseases, including obesity-related diseases, which are closely linked to adipogenesis. While the exact roles and mechanisms by which lncRNAs act in adipogenic differentiation and adipose tissue biology are still under investigation, their regulatory functions in these processes are increasingly recognized. Furthermore, specific lncRNAs, such as lnc-OAD, have been identified to modulate adipocyte differentiation. Therefore, it can be concluded that lncRNAs have a significant role in adipogenesis.",Yes
Is there any research that relates the function of Notch Signaling with Alzheimer Disease?,Yes,"Recent studies have identified Notch signaling as a contributor to neurodegeneration, including Alzheimer's Disease (AD) pathophysiology. Aberrant Notch signaling has emerged as a possible mechanism for altered neurogenesis, cognitive impairment, and learning and memory deficits associated with AD. Altered expression of Notch1 might be associated with the risk of AD, as significant increases of Notch expression have been observed in brains from patients at later stages of sporadic AD. Notch receptors have been hypothesized to play a role in neurodegeneration, particularly in AD (Notch1) and CADASIL (Notch3). Notch signaling plays an instrumental role in hippocampus-dependent memory formation, and recent evidence indicates a displacement of Notch1 and a reduction in its activity in hippocampal and cortical neurons from AD patients. Notch dysregulation may contribute to the neuritic dystrophy characteristically seen in AD brain. A functional relationship between amyloid precursor protein and Notch1 has been reported, and more Notch intracellular domain is found in the nucleus in the presence of exogenous amyloid precursor protein or its intracellular domain. This suggests a mechanism by which the amyloid precursor protein affects Notch signaling in certain cells. Notch signaling plays a crucial role in adult brain function, such as synaptic plasticity, memory, and olfaction, and deficits in the Notch pathway are involved in a number of neurologic diseases associated with mental retardation or/and dementia.",Yes
Was modafinil tested for schizophrenia treatment?,Yes,"Justification: The present study indicates that modafinil has been tested as an adjunctive treatment strategy for schizophrenia, particularly for the negative symptoms. Twenty-four patients diagnosed with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder were randomly assigned to receive modafinil up to 200 mg a day or placebo as an adjunct therapy in an 8-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. The study aimed to investigate the effect of modafinil added to risperidone in patients with chronic schizophrenia. The results suggest that modafinil selectively improves neuropsychological task performance, possibly through improved inhibitory control. Modafinil is a mild psychostimulant that evokes dopamine release from striatal neurons and is pharmacologically similar to, but less potent and efficacious than, amphetamine. However, its precise mechanisms of action remain unclear.",Yes
Is depression associated with poor prognosis of brain tumor patients?,Yes,"Evidence suggests that depression is associated with poor prognosis in brain tumor patients, specifically those with malignant astrocytoma. Patients who are actively depressed at the time of surgery have been observed to have decreased survival rates, independent of the degree of disability, tumor grade, or subsequent treatment modalities. Preoperative depressive symptoms have also been linked to poor outcomes in patients with astrocytoma. The relationship between depression and worse survival in brain tumor patients may be partially explained by tumor genotype, as cytokines associated with depressive symptoms are also important mediators of tumor growth and progression. However, the underlying mechanisms for this association are not yet fully understood.",Yes
Have germline variants been associated to colorectal cancer?,Yes,"Germline variants have indeed been associated with colorectal cancer (CRC) risk. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified several loci harboring variants that affect the risk of CRC. While the specific mechanisms by which germline variation influences tumorigenesis remain unrevealed, the inactivation of E-cadherin is common in CRC, and truncating germline mutations have been reported to confer susceptibility to CRC and diffuse gastric cancer. Moreover, common but weakly penetrant mutations of certain genes may confer an increased susceptibility to CRC and account for a proportion of 'sporadic' cases. Multiple single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been associated with CRC risk, and several GWAS have identified SNPs on chromosome 15q13.3 associated with CRC risk.",Yes
Can Alzheimer's disease related miRNAs be detected in patients' blood?,Yes,"Recent evidence suggests that circulating miRNAs may serve as promising biomarkers for the clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). These small non-coding RNAs are released from neurons and enter the bloodstream, potentially reflecting AD progression. As such, they are considered attractive molecules for use as blood-based biomarkers for neurodegenerative disorders such as AD. In particular, studies have identified differentially expressed serum miRNAs that could be used as biomarkers to improve the diagnosis of AD, particularly at the early stage. Furthermore, the expression levels of specific miRNAs, such as exosomal miR-135a, -193b, and -384, have been measured in the serum of patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), dementia of Alzheimer's type (DAT), Parkinson's disease with dementia (PDD), and vascular dementia (VAD). These findings support the potential use of blood-borne miRNAs, along with other markers, as non-invasive and relatively inexpensive biomarkers for the early diagnosis of AD, although further research and validation are needed.",Yes
Is it possible to visualize subtahalamic nucleus by using transcranial ultrasound?,Yes,"Transcranial ultrasound, a relatively new ultrasound modality, has demonstrated its potential in visualizing various brain structures, including deep brain regions such as the subthalamic nucleus (STN). The feasibility and usefulness of transcranial sonography during surgery for the implantation of stimulation electrodes into the STN of patients with Parkinson's disease have been assessed. Furthermore, recent evidence indicates that transcranial ultrasound stimulation (TUS) modulates sensorimotor cortex excitability. Ultrasound intensity delivery at the STN by a simple single element transducer is possible and could be a promising alternative to complex multi-element phased arrays or invasive neuromodulation techniques. These findings suggest that transcranial ultrasound can indeed be used to visualize the subthalamic nucleus.",Yes
Do thyroid hormone receptors change after brain injury?,Yes,"Thyroid hormone receptors (TRs) may indeed undergo alterations after brain injury. Research has shown that the expression of genes important for thyroid hormone action in the brain, such as MCT8 and type 2 deiodinase (Dio2), diminished after injury. However, these genes were partially restored with T4 treatment, suggesting a potential role for thyroid hormones in neuronal recovery after injury. Moreover, studies have indicated that TRs, specifically TRÎ±1 and TRÎ²1, might change after experimental stroke. These findings support the hypothesis that thyroid hormones and their receptors may play a significant role in the pathophysiology of acute cerebral ischemia and potentially other types of brain injury. However, further research is needed to fully understand the extent and implications of these changes in TRs after brain injury.",Yes
Is gastro esophageal reflux related to burning mouth syndrome?,Yes,"Gastroesophageal reflux (GER) can be related to burning mouth syndrome (BMS), as GER involves the retrograde flow of gastric contents into the esophagus, which can evoke symptoms and/or lesions not only in the esophagus but also in the oral cavity. The reflux of stomach contents, including acid, can cause irritation and inflammation of the oral mucosa, leading to symptoms such as a burning sensation, pain, and altered taste in the mouth. These symptoms are consistent with those observed in BMS, a chronic condition characterized by a burning sensation in the oral cavity in the absence of clinically apparent oral mucosal changes. Therefore, GER may contribute to the development or exacerbation of BMS in some individuals.",No
Is thrombophilia related to increased risk of miscarriage?,Yes,"Thrombophilia, both inherited and acquired, has been identified as a risk factor for pregnancy failure, including recurrent miscarriage. Studies have shown that women with thrombophilia have an increased incidence of recurrent fetal miscarriages and late fetal loss. The specific inherited thrombophilic genes, such as Factor V Leiden and Prothrombin G20210A mutations, have been found to be associated with a higher risk of miscarriage. The exact mechanism by which thrombophilia contributes to pregnancy loss is not fully understood, but it is thought to involve abnormal blood clotting and vascular complications. The association between thrombophilia and adverse pregnancy outcomes has led to a growing view that inherited or acquired thrombophilia may predispose women towards an adverse pregnancy outcome. Further research is needed to better understand the role of thrombophilia in pregnancy failure and to develop effective preventive strategies.",Yes
Does nifedipine inhibit L-type calcium channels?,Yes,"Nifedipine, a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker, is known to induce specific pharmacological effects by binding to L-type calcium channels. This results in a reduced calcium influx in vascular smooth muscle cells, which is a key mechanism in its antihypertensive action. The high receptor affinity of nifedipine allows it to effectively block L-type calcium channels in vascular muscle cells. Furthermore, there is evidence suggesting that nifedipine can also block low voltage-activated (LVA or T-type) calcium channels. Therefore, it can be concluded that nifedipine does inhibit L-type calcium channels.",Yes
Is there any data to suggest that TRH (thyrotropin releasing hormone) administration can improve symptom severity of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients?,Yes,"Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) has demonstrated potential therapeutic applications in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) due to its function as a neuroregulator of the anterior horn cell. TRH has been shown to have rapid-onset (30 seconds) and slow-offset (1-12 days) clinical benefits in patients with ALS and other motor neuron disorders. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that posttraumatic treatment of spinal cord injury with TRH or TRH analogs improves long-term behavioral recovery. Furthermore, TRH has been suggested as an adjunct in the treatment of ALS, and its direct intrathecal administration has been explored in both short-term boluses and infusions, as well as chronic constant infusions. Although the mechanism of neuroprotection is not fully understood, and clinical studies have been divided on the efficacy of TRH, there is evidence to suggest that TRH administration may improve symptom severity in ALS patients.",Yes
Can siRNA affect response to afatinib treatment?,Yes,"Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) have the potential to affect response to afatinib treatment. siRNAs are known to synergistically enhance the cell killing effects of drugs used in cancer treatment, and can be designed to specifically inhibit the expression of any protein involved in tumor initiation and progression. This includes proteins that may be targeted by afatinib, such as EGFR or HER2. Additionally, siRNAs have been shown to induce changes in cell viability in a target-independent fashion, which may also impact the response to afatinib treatment. However, it is important to note that the limited cellular uptake, low biological stability, and unfavorable pharmacokinetics of siRNAs have limited their application in the clinic. Therefore, further research is needed to optimize the delivery and stability of siRNAs in order to fully realize their potential as a therapeutic approach for cancer treatment.",Yes
Is there an association between presenteeism and depression?,Yes,"The scientific literature supports the existence of a significant association between presenteeism and depression. Univariate linear regression has confirmed a negative linear relationship between depression severity and presenteeism, with increases in depression severity leading to decreases in work performance. This relationship remains significant even after controlling for factors such as age, gender, industry, and work position. Furthermore, individuals with current depression exhibit higher levels of psychological distress and anxiety, lower life satisfaction, and poorer cognitive performance compared to those without depression. These findings suggest that depression is a major cause of illness-related suboptimal work performance, or presenteeism. Additionally, presenteeism and absenteeism are significantly worse in individuals with depression only and anxiety only compared to those with non-clinical symptom levels. These results highlight the importance of addressing depression in the workplace and its impact on employee productivity and well-being.",Yes
Does triiodothyronine stimulate red blood cell sodium potassium pump?,Inconclusive,"Triiodothyronine (T3) has been shown to regulate Na+-K+-ATPase activity in various mammalian target tissues, including the heart and kidneys. However, the context does not provide direct evidence of T3 stimulating the Na+-K+-ATPase, or the sodium-potassium pump, in red blood cells (erythrocytes). Although TSH appears to affect human erythrocyte Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase in vitro, the mechanism and the presence of receptors on erythrocytes have not yet been described. Therefore, based on the given context, it is inconclusive whether T3 stimulates the red blood cell sodium-potassium pump. Further research is required to establish a direct link between T3 and erythrocyte Na+-K+-ATPase regulation.",Yes
Is selumetinib effective in thyroid cancer?,Yes,"Selumetinib, a MEK inhibitor, has been shown to have potential in treating radioiodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer (RR-DTC). Preclinical studies have demonstrated a significant reduction in cell viability in all thyroid cancer cell lines. Furthermore, selumetinib has been observed to increase radioiodine uptake and retention in a subgroup of patients with RR-DTC. Although selumetinib has modest clinical activity as monotherapy in patients with advanced cancer, combinations of selumetinib with cytotoxic agents in patients with BRAF or KRAS mutations hold great promise for cancer treatment. While selumetinib did not improve progression-free survival compared to current therapies, it did identify better clinical benefits and less disease progression, although its impact was not statistically significant.",Yes
Are immune cells affected in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis?,Yes,"Evidence suggests that immune cells are affected in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). Patients with ALS have persistent peripheral and central inflammatory responses, including abnormally functioning T cells and activated microglia. Circulatory immune complexes are increased in ALS, and an autoimmune mechanism has been inferred. Regulatory T-cells, which are immune-suppressive agents, are dramatically and progressively decreased in patients with ALS. Furthermore, CD8 cytotoxic T cells and natural killer (NK) T cells are significantly increased in ALS patients compared to a control group. These findings indicate that immune cells are affected in ALS and may play a role in its pathogenesis.",Yes
Are OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 associated with bilirubin transport?,Yes,"Organic anion-transporting polypeptides OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 are indeed associated with bilirubin transport. These transporters are located at the basolateral membrane of hepatocytes and facilitate the uptake of bilirubin into the liver cells. The bilirubin elimination process involves a multifaceted mechanism, in which OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 play a crucial role by mediating the liver uptake of conjugated and unconjugated bilirubin. The expression of OATP1B1 has been shown to be significantly affected by genetic variants, further supporting its role in bilirubin transport.",Yes
Is thyroid hormone therapy indicated in patients with heart failure?,Yes,"Thyroid hormone therapy may be indicated in patients with heart failure, particularly those with concurrent subclinical hypothyroidism. Animal and human studies have demonstrated potential benefits of thyroid hormone treatment in heart diseases, including heart failure. Thyroid hormone abnormalities are common in severe heart failure and may have prognostic value. The heart is a major target of thyroid hormones, and maintenance of euthyroid hormone balance is critical for proper cardiac function. However, the therapeutic potential of using thyroid hormone for cardiogenic shock resulting from progressive heart failure has not been fully delineated. Further research is needed to establish the efficacy and safety of thyroid hormone supplementation in heart failure patients.",Yes
Is there a mouse model for Fanconi anemia?,Yes,"Justification: The existence of a murine model for Fanconi anemia (FA) is substantiated by the presence of fancd2(-/-) mice, which display readily measurable hematopoietic defects and features resembling human FA, such as cellular DNA repair defects. Furthermore, a murine model containing a disruption of the murine homologue (fac) of FA group C has been utilized to evaluate the role of fac in the pathogenesis of bone marrow failure. Although FA mouse models do not fully mimic the hematopoietic phenotype, the fancd2 mutant mice exhibit phenotypes not observed in other mice with disruptions of proximal FA genes. The mitomycin C-treated fancc(-/-) mouse model also provides a valuable tool for addressing the long-term efficacy of such treatment. Therefore, it can be concluded that there are indeed mouse models available for studying Fanconi anemia.",No
Could Hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) be effective for the treatment of recurrent ovarian cancer?,Yes,"Hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) has been investigated as a potential treatment for recurrent ovarian cancer. The combination of cytoreductive surgery with intraoperative HIPEC has been shown to improve outcomes in patients with recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer. HIPEC involves the continuous circulation of heated chemotherapy agents throughout the peritoneum, which may improve efficacy and increase the recurrence-free time interval. Additionally, HIPEC has been used in conjunction with complete surgical removal of the tumor in relapsing patients, providing a clinical benefit. While further research is needed to fully understand the potential of HIPEC in the treatment of recurrent ovarian cancer, current evidence suggests that it may be a viable option for selected patients.",Yes
Is Rac1 involved in cancer cell invasion?,Yes,"Rac1, a member of the Rho GTPase family, is involved in cancer cell invasion. This protein is a well-established master regulator of cell motility and invasiveness, contributing to cancer metastasis. Rac1 dysregulation, resulting in elevated motile and invasive potential, has been reported in multiple cancers. The overexpression of Rac1 has been observed in several human cancers, with significant correlations between Rac1 expression and tumor location, stage, depth, and lymph node metastasis. Rac1 signaling modulates cancer progression, as its overexpression leads to increased tumor growth, while a reduction in Rac1 expression interferes with cancer progression. Furthermore, Rac1 regulates the organization of the cytoskeleton, a crucial process in cell migration and invasion during cancer metastasis. Inhibition of Rac1 activity has been shown to inhibit lung cancer cell migration and invasion, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target for various cancers.",Yes
Is the gene SLC6A2 associated with orthostatic intolerance?,No,"The gene SLC6A2 does not appear to be associated with orthostatic intolerance based on the provided context. The context discusses several genes, including SLC16A11, SLC1A1, SLC22A2, and SLC6A4, in relation to various conditions such as type 2 diabetes, normal tension glaucoma, and late-life major depressive disorder (MDD). However, there is no mention or indication of SLC6A2 being linked to orthostatic intolerance. Therefore, based on the given information, it can be concluded that SLC6A2 is not associated with orthostatic intolerance.",Yes
Is macitentan an ET agonist?,No,"Macitentan is not an agonist of endothelin receptors. Rather, it is a potent, orally active, non-peptide antagonist of endothelin receptors with tissue-targeting properties. This drug is designed to achieve a more efficacious endothelin receptor blockade, which is beneficial in the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension. The study indicates that macitentan increased plasma endothelin-1 concentrations, but this is due to its antagonistic activity, not agonistic. The drug was well tolerated and elicited no serious adverse events, demonstrating its safety and efficacy in clinical use.",Yes
Can we use platelet biomarkers to study Alzheimer's disease?,Yes,"The study suggests that platelets may serve as a source of blood-based biomarkers in neurodegenerative disease, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Platelet proteins, such as amyloid-precursor protein (APP), have been studied as AD biomarkers with relative success. The discovery of intact APP in platelet granules has sparked interest in the biochemistry, physiology, and function of platelets in AD patients. Blood-based biomarkers for AD might facilitate identification of participants for clinical trials targeting amyloid beta accumulation and aid in AD diagnostics. The study also investigates whether alterations of caspase family and Bcl2 family could be found in the platelets of AD and amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients. Given the similarities between neuron and platelet biology, platelets may serve as a peripheral matrix for biomarkers of neurological disorders. An altered platelet ratio of APP isoforms might be a diagnostic, predictive, or therapeutic marker for AD. The study reports a comparative analysis of the membrane-enriched platelet proteome between patients with mild to moderate AD and cognitively normal, healthy subjects. After subjects were grouped according to diagnosis and severity of dementia, APP isoform levels in platelets were compared. The study hypothesizes that platelet membrane-associated protein changes may differentiate patients clinically defined with probable AD from noncognitive impaired controls.",Yes
Is CHEK2 involved in cell cycle control?,Yes,"CHEK2 is a critical component in the regulation of cell cycle progression. It acts as a DNA damage-activated protein kinase that plays a significant role in cell cycle checkpoint control. Upon DNA damage, CHEK2 is activated and halts the cell cycle, allowing for DNA repair mechanisms to take effect. If the damage is irreparable, CHEK2 can trigger apoptosis, or programmed cell death, to prevent the propagation of damaged cells. Furthermore, CHEK2 is involved in phosphorylating several important targets, such as cdc25 and p53, which are key regulators of the cell cycle. Thus, it is evident that CHEK2 is involved in cell cycle control and plays a crucial role in maintaining genomic integrity.",Yes
Are the proteins Erbin (LAP2) and Merlin cooperating?,No,"Merlin and Erbin are distinct proteins that belong to the same family of proteins known as the ERM (ezrin-radixin-moesin) family. While they share significant sequence similarity and have similar functions in linking membrane proteins to the actin cytoskeleton, they are not cooperating in the sense of working together in a specific biological process. Instead, they have distinct roles in regulating cellular functions. Merlin is a tumor suppressor protein that inhibits cell growth when overexpressed, while Erbin is involved in regulating cell signaling pathways. Furthermore, Merlin lacks a C-terminal F-actin binding site, which is present in ERM proteins, highlighting the differences in their functions. Therefore, while Merlin and Erbin have similarities in their structure and function, they are not cooperating in a specific biological process.",Yes
Is abdominal pain a common symptom in autism?,Yes,"Evidence suggests that individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) are more likely to experience a range of gastrointestinal abnormalities compared to typically developing individuals. Abdominal pain is one of the common gastrointestinal symptoms experienced by children with ASD. Recent research has indicated that recurrent abdominal pain in children is associated with visceral hyperalgesia. Furthermore, a significant difference in the reporting of bowel symptoms, including abdominal pain, was found between children with ASD and a control group of typically developing children. It is important to note that abdominal pain and other gastrointestinal symptoms are common presenting features of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, which can overlap with infectious or inflammatory abdominal conditions. However, it is not specifically associated with ASD as bowel symptoms were reported in similar frequency to a comparison group of children with other developmental and neurological disorders.",Yes
Are cyclophilins ubiquitously expressed?,Yes,"Cyclophilins are indeed ubiquitously expressed proteins. They belong to the peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerases (PPIases) family and are present in a wide variety of organisms, including bacteria, yeast, plants, and animals. Cyclophilins have been discovered in many types of cells and organ systems, demonstrating their widespread distribution. They are involved in a multitude of processes such as protein maturation and trafficking, receptor complex stabilization, apoptosis, receptor signaling, RNA processing, and spliceosome assembly. Cyclophilins are also known for their role in protein folding and immunosuppression by cyclosporin A (CSA). The ubiquitous expression of cyclophilins underscores their fundamental importance in various biological events.",Yes
Are adenylyl cyclases always transmembrane proteins?,No,"Adenylyl cyclases are not always transmembrane proteins. While the majority of adenylyl cyclases are transmembrane proteins, as evidenced by their 12 transmembrane domains and their role in integrating and interpreting divergent signals from different pathways, mammalian cells also possess a second source of cyclic AMP (cAMP), the soluble adenylyl cyclase (sAC). This enzyme is not membrane-bound and is ubiquitously expressed in mammalian cells. The existence of sAC demonstrates that adenylyl cyclases can exist in both transmembrane and soluble forms.",Yes
Does low T3 negatively affect prognosis of patients after cardiac surgery?,Yes,"Low T3 levels have been identified as a strong predictor of poor outcomes in cardiac patients, including those who have undergone cardiac surgery. The postoperative period after cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass is associated with a low T3 syndrome, which is indicative of a poor prognosis in patients with cardiac dysfunction. Clinical and experimental data have suggested a potential negative impact of low T3 state on the prognosis of cardiac diseases. Low T3 levels have been associated with higher 30-day hospital mortality and higher 6-month overall mortality in non-critically ill patients. Additionally, low T3 levels are related to increased early and late mortality in patients with non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome. In conclusion, low T3 predicts worse hospital outcomes in patients with acute heart failure and can be useful in the risk stratification of these patients.",Yes
Does neuroglobin has neuroprotective properties in the setting of traumatic brain injury?,Yes,"Neuroglobin, a neuron-specific oxygen-binding protein, has demonstrated neuroprotective properties in the context of traumatic brain injury (TBI). Studies have shown that neuroglobin expression increases significantly in response to severe TBI, potentially indicating a protective mechanism against hypoxic injury. This protein has been found to promote neuronal survival by augmenting oxygen supply and inhibiting oxidative and nitrosative stress. Although the specific mechanisms of neuroglobin's neuroprotective effects are not fully understood, it has been proposed to contribute to neuroprotection through scavenging and detoxification of reactive oxygen/nitrogen species, augmenting the threshold for apoptosis initiation, contributing to an anti-inflammatory milieu, and promoting tissue regeneration. Despite a lack of effect in mild TBI, the potential neuroprotective role of neuroglobin in severe TBI warrants further investigation.",Yes
"Does the concentration of protein HIF-1Î± increase after the administration of the cytoprotective prodrug""amifostine"" (ethyol) ?",No,"The provided context does not include any information regarding the effect of amifostine on HIF-1Î± protein levels. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether the concentration of protein HIF-1Î± increases after the administration of the cytoprotective prodrug ""amifostine"" (ethyol) based solely on the given context. Further research and experimental evidence are required to answer this question accurately.",Yes
Do Conserved noncoding elements act as enhancers?,Yes,"Conserved noncoding elements (CNEs) are known to act as enhancers, particularly in the context of developmental gene regulation in vertebrates. CNEs are regions of extreme noncoding conservation in metazoan genomes and have been shown to be a rich source for the discovery of gene regulatory regions, such as transcriptional enhancers. These elements often function as cis-acting elements, providing binding sites for trans-acting factors, and are thought to play a crucial role in gene regulation. Furthermore, recent studies have revealed that active enhancers are transcribed, producing a class of noncoding RNAs called enhancer RNAs (eRNAs). These eRNAs are a subset of long noncoding RNAs generated from genomic enhancers and are thought to act as potent promoters of the expression of nearby genes through interaction with the transcriptional and epigenomic machineries. Therefore, it can be concluded that conserved noncoding elements act as enhancers.",Yes
Can the iPS cell technology be used in Fanconi anemia therapy?,Yes,"The utilization of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) in Fanconi anemia (FA) therapy is a promising approach. iPSCs offer an invaluable tool for studying the molecular defects underlying FA due to their ability to be derived from patients with specific diseases. Although generating FA patient-specific iPSCs can be technically challenging, their potential as a source for cell replacement therapy is significant. iPSCs could represent an unlimited source of autologous cells, which can be applied in advanced treatments such as gene therapy. The technology to develop endoderm-derived human iPSC lines, along with other established cell lines, will provide a foundation for understanding the mechanisms of cellular reprogramming and for studying the safety and efficacy of differentially originated human iPSCs for cell therapy. Ultimately, genetic correction, molecular characterization, and successful engraftment of iPSC-derived cells may provide an attractive alternative to current hematopoietic stem cell-targeted gene therapy in monogenic diseases, including FA.",No
Can Preimplantation Genetic Diagnosis (PGD) be used for gender selection?,Yes,"Preimplantation Genetic Diagnosis (PGD) can be used for gender selection. This procedure was originally developed to diagnose embryo-related genetic abnormalities for couples with a high risk of a specific inherited disorder. However, its use has been extended to other indications, including gender selection. PGD permits the selection of embryos of a particular genotype prior to implantation, allowing for the identification of the gender of the embryo. The use of PGD for gender selection may not breach the principles of ethics and is unlikely to alter the population balance of sexes. However, it is important to consider the clinical and ethical issues prior to offering PGD gender selection, particularly in cases where there is no history of sex-linked genetic disease.",Yes
Has proteomics been used in the study of the dry eye syndrome?,Yes,"Proteomics has indeed been employed in the study of dry eye syndrome, as evidenced by the use of mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomic strategies to investigate the tear proteome of patients with dry eye. This approach has enabled the identification of aberrant protein expression in the tear film of diabetic patients with dry eye syndrome, potentially leading to the discovery of novel therapeutic targets and diagnostic markers. The utilization of surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (SELDI-TOF-MS) protein chip array technology has further facilitated the automated analysis of proteins and peptides in tear fluid. The identification of differentially expressed proteins in the tear proteome of type 2 diabetes with dry eye has been achieved through the application of discovery proteomics strategy. These findings underscore the importance of characterizing proteins in ocular surface fluids, including tear fluid and lacrimal fluid, to better understand the pathophysiology of dry eye disease.",Yes
Is Tuberous Sclerosis a genetic disease?,Yes,"Tuberous Sclerosis is indeed a genetic disease. It is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by mutations in either the TSC1 or TSC2 genes. These mutations can be heterozygous, meaning they occur in one of the two copies of the gene. The disorder is characterized by the early development of hamartomas, malformations, and congenital tumors in various organs, including the nervous system, skin, kidneys, lungs, and heart. The clinical manifestations of Tuberous Sclerosis are diverse and can result in significant disability. The disorder is relatively rare, with an incidence of about 1 in 6000 live births.",Yes
Does TRIM37 gene mutation causes Mulibrey nanism?,Yes,"The TRIM37 gene mutation is the underlying cause of Mulibrey nanism. This rare autosomal recessive disorder is characterized by severe growth failure, dysmorphic features, cardiopathy, and metabolic syndrome, all of which have prenatal onset. The TRIM37 gene encodes a protein of unknown function that belongs to the tripartite motif (TRIM) family. Mutations in this gene lead to defective ubiquitin-dependent degradation of an as-yet-unidentified target protein, contributing to the pathogenesis of Mulibrey nanism. Furthermore, TRIM37 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase, and its dysfunction in Mulibrey nanism results in impaired organ growth and increased tumor formation.",Yes
Have thyronamines effects on fat tissue?,No,"The context does not provide explicit information about the effects of thyronamines on fat tissue. Thyronamines are a class of thyroid hormone derivatives that have been shown to have various physiological effects, including regulation of metabolism and heart function. However, the context primarily focuses on the role of thyroid hormones, such as triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4), in modulating adipose tissue metabolism and differentiation. The context also mentions the presence of thyrotropin receptor (TSHR) in adipose tissue and its potential role in adipose differentiation, but does not discuss thyronamines. Therefore, based on the given context, it cannot be concluded that thyronamines have effects on fat tissue.",Yes
Is there any protein that undergoes both mono-ubiquitination and poly-ubiquitination?,Yes,"Protein ubiquitination is a versatile and dynamic post-translational modification that allows for the attachment of single ubiquitin molecules or polyubiquitin chains to target proteins, resulting in mono- or poly-ubiquitination, respectively. The functional consequences of the type of ubiquitination vary, with polyubiquitinated proteins targeted for degradation by the proteasome, whereas monoubiquitination is implicated in other cellular functions. However, it is possible for a protein to undergo both mono- and poly-ubiquitination, depending on the specific lysine residues that are modified and the length and type of ubiquitin chains that are attached. Therefore, it is possible for a protein to be both mono- and poly-ubiquitinated, and the specific consequences of this dual modification would depend on the context in which it occurs.",Yes
Are pseudogenes enriched with housekeeping protein families?,Insufficient,"Information

The context provided does not offer explicit information regarding the enrichment of pseudogenes with housekeeping protein families. However, it does emphasize the growing recognition of pseudogenes as significant resources in understanding human protein evolution and their involvement in important biological processes, despite their previous classification as nonfunctional gene fossils. The context also highlights the abundance of pseudogenes in the human genome and their role in driving dynamic evolution of mammalian genomes. Nevertheless, the specific enrichment of pseudogenes with housekeeping protein families remains unaddressed in the given context.",Yes
Is olaparib effective for prostate cancer?,Yes,"Olaparib, a Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor, has been demonstrated to be effective for the treatment of prostate cancer, specifically metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Clinical trials have shown that olaparib can lead to significantly longer imaging-based progression-free survival compared to other treatments such as enzalutamide or abiraterone. Additionally, olaparib in combination with abiraterone has been found to provide clinical efficacy benefit for patients with mCRPC compared to abiraterone alone. The combination of olaparib and the c-met inhibitor pha665752 has also been suggested as a promising therapeutic strategy for prostate cancer. However, it is important to note that olaparib's cytotoxicity and off-target effects, including DNA damage, can limit its clinical applications. Nonetheless, olaparib remains an important and viable option for prostate cancer patients, particularly those with BRCA mutations.",Yes
Is physical performance influenced by thyroid hormone metabolism?,Yes,"Thyroid hormones are known to play a crucial role in energy metabolism and regulation, which in turn can influence physical performance. Studies have shown that variations in thyroid function within the normal range are associated with differences in metabolism and body composition. In the context of physical exercise, thyroid hormones may influence energy processes and contribute to changes in muscle mass and strength. Although some studies demonstrate only transient or insignificant changes in thyroid hormones during strenuous exercise, the association between thyroid function and physical performance is supported by evidence. For instance, research has found that male elite athletes have lower TSH-FT3 ratios and free leptin index (FLI) than controls, and FLI is independently associated with the TSH-FT3 ratio. This suggests that the level of biologically active leptin may be involved in the adaptive response of thyroid function in professional athletes. Furthermore, thyroid hormones are known to play a crucial role in muscle function, such as myogenesis and energy metabolism, and may be involved in the entropic processes of muscle aging. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that physical performance can be influenced by thyroid hormone metabolism, although more research is needed to fully understand the underlying mechanisms and the impact of exercise on thyroid hormone metabolism in different populations.",Yes
Do plant genomes contain CpG islands?,Yes,"Justification: Plant genomes, including those of rice and Arabidopsis thaliana, have been found to contain DNA segments rich in CpG dinucleotides, which are often referred to as CpG islands. These CpG-rich clusters in plant genomes satisfy the criteria used for identifying human CpG islands, suggesting that they may be regarded as plant CpG islands. The position of a plant CpG island within its associated gene appears to be related to the extent of tissue-specific expression of the gene, with the CpG islands of most widely expressed rice genes occurring near the 5'-end of the genes.",Yes
Are high-flow nasal cannulae effective for treatment of preterm infants?,Yes,"High-flow nasal cannulae (HFNC) are increasingly used as an alternative to nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) for noninvasive respiratory support in preterm infants. A multicenter, randomized, noninferiority trial involving 303 very preterm infants demonstrated that the efficacy of HFNC was similar to that of CPAP as respiratory support for very preterm infants after extubation, with treatment failure occurring in 34.2% of infants in the HFNC group and 25.8% in the CPAP group. Although the result for the primary outcome was close to the margin of noninferiority, this finding suggests that HFNC is a promising alternative to CPAP for noninvasive respiratory support in preterm infants. However, further research is needed to determine the optimum flow rates and to address concerns about the indiscriminate therapeutic use, size selection, and safety of nasal cannulas for the routine delivery of oxygen in preterm infants.",Yes
Does triiodothyronine play a regulatory role in insulin secretion from pancreas?,Yes,"Triiodothyronine (T3) has been identified as a key regulator of insulin secretion from the pancreas. In the context of the present study, it was found that T3 induced hyperthyroidism caused significantly elevated basal and stimulated glucose and insulin levels in rats. Moreover, T3 treatment decreased the immediate insulin secretory response of the pancreas slightly. Additionally, it was observed that T3 concentrations correlated positively with insulin production and fasting insulin, independent of age and gender. The study also revealed that T3 has a direct regulatory role in insulin secretion, depending on its concentration and the glucose level itself. These findings suggest that T3 plays a crucial role in the regulation of insulin secretion from the pancreas.",Yes
Is the Histidine-Rich Calcium Binding protein (HRC) related to arrhythmias and cardiac disease?,Yes,"The Histidine-Rich Calcium Binding protein (HRC) has been linked to arrhythmias and cardiac disease, particularly in the context of dilated cardiomyopathy. The HRC ser96ala polymorphism has been shown to correlate with ventricular arrhythmias and sudden death in dilated cardiomyopathy patients, but not in healthy human carriers. This genetic variant has been identified as a potential biomarker for ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death in patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. The ser96ala mutation within HRC has been linked to cardiac arrhythmias in idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy patients, potentially due to an increase in spontaneous calcium release events. HRC is a regulator of calcium homeostasis and plays a significant role in sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium uptake, storage, and release. Chronic overexpression of HRC that disrupts intracellular calcium homeostasis is implicated in the pathogenesis of cardiac hypertrophy. HRC has also been linked with familial cardiac conduction disease and an HRC polymorphism has been shown to associate with malignant ventricular arrhythmias in the background of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy.",Yes
Can adult humans be induced to produce fetal hemoglobin?,Yes,"Evidence suggests that adult humans can be induced to produce fetal hemoglobin, as this process has been observed in vivo in adults with various hemoglobinopathies and other hemopoietic disorders. The induction of fetal-type hemoglobin (HbF) is considered a promising approach to ameliorate the severity of hemoglobinopathies like Î²-thalassemia and sickle cell anemia. Fetal hemoglobin production in adult human erythroid progenitors can be influenced by exogenous factors, such as pharmacological agents like hydroxycarbamide (HC), which can increase fetal hemoglobin synthesis during adult life. The ontogenic switch from fetal to adult hemoglobin is thought to be due to the gradual replacement of fetal by adult erythroid progenitor cells, each with unique potential hemoglobin expression programs. Increased fetal hemoglobin (HbF) in erythroid precursors of patients with beta-hemoglobinopathies, in which adult hemoglobin synthesis is defective, has been shown to ameliorate the clinical symptoms of the underlying diseases.",Yes
Is Turcot syndrome associated with glioblastoma?,Yes,"Turcot syndrome, also known as the glioma-polyposis syndrome, is a rare genetic disorder that predisposes individuals to glioblastoma, particularly in the Type 1 variant. This disorder is characterized by colonic polyposis and central nervous system neoplasms, typically glioblastomas or medulloblastomas. Patients with Turcot syndrome are predisposed to colon tumors and primary brain tumors, such as glioblastomas. The association between brain tumors, including glioblastomas, and colonic polyposis is a defining feature of Turcot syndrome. This rare hereditary disease has been reported in approximately 20 cases and is characterized by the concurrence of a primary brain tumor and multiple colorectal adenomas.",Yes
Is Calcium/Calmodulin dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) involved in cardiac arrhythmias and heart failure?,Yes,"Calcium/Calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) is indeed involved in cardiac arrhythmias and heart failure. CaMKII is a multifunctional enzyme that plays a crucial role in cardiac physiology and pathology. It has been identified as a key enzyme in various cardiac pathologies, including heart failure, myocardial infarction, and cardiomyopathies. The activation of CaMKII is established as a central intracellular trigger for these conditions, as well as for hypertrophy and arrhythmias in both animals and humans. Excessive activation of CaMKII can lead to arrhythmias and heart failure, while its dysfunction is associated with increased susceptibility to life-threatening arrhythmias. Furthermore, the predominant isoform of CaMKII expressed in the heart, CaMKIIÎ´, is implicated in the progression of myocardial infarction and pressure overload-induced pathological remodeling. The increased expression and activation of CaMKII is linked to an elevated risk for arrhythmic events and is a hallmark of human heart failure.",Yes
Does SCRIB deregulation promote cancer?,Yes,"The deregulation of SCRIB, a polarity regulator and tumor-suppressor protein, has been shown to promote cancer. SCRIB is abnormally expressed in cancer at the protein level and is frequently amplified in human cancers. However, it does not localize properly to cell-cell junctions, which disrupts its tumor-suppressive activities. In breast cancer, an unexpected SCRIB exon usage pattern has been identified, which marks a more malignant tumor phenotype and significantly correlates with survival. The inclusion or exclusion of specific SCRIB exons is a mechanistic hallmark of breast cancer. The localization of SCRIB is regulated by S-palmitoylation at conserved cysteine residues, and palmitoylation-deficient mutants of SCRIB are mislocalized, leading to disruption of cell polarity and loss of their tumor-suppressive activities. Knockout of ZDHHC7, the major palmitoyl acyltransferase regulating SCRIB, leads to SCRIB mislocalization and YAP activation, and disruption of SCRIB's suppressive activities in Hras(V12)-induced cell invasion. Therefore, SCRIB deregulation is a critical factor in the development and progression of cancer.",Yes
Is cardiac magnetic resonance imaging indicated in the pre-participation screening of athletes?,Yes,", with conditions.

Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) is increasingly used in the work-up of athletes with suspected cardiac abnormalities on screening. Although not typically recommended as a first-line screening tool, CMR is frequently used in the investigation of suspected cardiac disease in athletes. For patients less than 35 years of age, CMR is the first option after initial echocardiography for further assessment of cardiomyopathies, myocarditis, and coronary anomalies, which are major causes of sudden cardiac death in young athletes. CMR can also be used in athletes with suspected cardiomyopathy, with particular reference to volumetric analysis and tissue characterization. Therefore, CMR can be indicated in pre-participation screening of athletes, especially when there is a suspicion of cardiac abnormalities or when further assessment is needed after initial echocardiography.",Yes
Is imatinib an antidepressant drug?,No,"Imatinib is not classified as an antidepressant drug. Imatinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor primarily used to treat certain types of cancer, such as chronic myeloid leukemia, gastrointestinal stromal tumors, and dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans. Its mechanism of action involves blocking the activity of specific enzymes that promote cancer growth. In contrast, antidepressant drugs, such as imipramine, work by altering the levels of neurotransmitters in the brain, like serotonin and norepinephrine, to improve mood and alleviate symptoms of depression. Therefore, imatinib and antidepressants have different mechanisms of action and are used to treat distinct medical conditions.",Yes
Are ultraconserved elements depleted among copy number variants (CNVs)?,Yes,"Justification: Ultraconserved elements (UCEs) have been demonstrated to be depleted among copy number variants (CNVs) in the human genome. This depletion is observed in both segmental duplications and CNVs, with even newly formed de novo CNVs showing significant depletion for UCEs. The higher divergence rates observed in CNV-type core elements compared to constant-type core elements indicate a longer evolutionary history for the former, further supporting the depletion of UCEs in CNVs. The observed bias against copy-number losses for common variants suggests that deletions are subject to purifying selection, which may contribute to the depletion of UCEs in CNVs. Conserved noncoding elements, including UCEs, constitute the majority of sequences under purifying selection in the human genome, yet their function remains largely unknown. Nevertheless, the depletion of UCEs in CNVs suggests that deletion or duplication of a UCE can be deleterious to the mammalian cell.",Yes
Is the microRNA 132 (miR-132) involved in brain pathologies?,Yes,"MicroRNA 132 (miR-132) plays a significant role in the central nervous system, being involved in prosurvival, anti-inflammatory, and memory-promoting functions. It is enriched in the central nervous system and has been found to be associated with several neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and epilepsy. MiR-132 is also linked with synaptic plasticity and cognitive impairment. The dysregulation of miR-132 results in the occurrence and exacerbation of neural developmental and degenerative diseases, as well as psychiatric disorders, including disturbance of consciousness, cognition, memory, depression, and schizophrenia. Furthermore, miR-132 is significant for regulating neuronal differentiation, maturation, and functioning, and participates in axon growth, neural migration, and plasticity. These findings suggest that miR-132 is involved in brain pathologies.",Yes
Does cucumber lower blood sugar in diabetics?,No,"The context provided discusses the effects of curcumin, a compound found in turmeric, on blood sugar levels and diabetes management. It mentions that curcumin significantly reduced glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in prediabetics, lowered fasting blood glucose, and improved pancreas function in animal models of diabetes. Curcumin was also found to have potential value in treating diabetic kidney disease and alleviating diabetic lung injury. However, the context does not provide any information on the effects of cucumber on blood sugar levels in diabetics. Therefore, based on the given context, it cannot be concluded that cucumber lowers blood sugar in diabetics.",Yes
Are Notch mutations related to T-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (T-ALL)?,Yes,"Notch mutations are indeed related to T-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (T-ALL). Activating mutations in Notch1, an essential regulator of T-cell development, are frequently found in human T-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (T-ALL). These mutations lead to aberrant downstream signaling and are one of the most common molecular events in T-ALL. Notch signaling is of crucial importance in normal T-cell development, and its deregulation is a key factor in the pathogenesis of T-ALL. Notch1 mutations are found in more than 50% of T-ALL cells, and Notch1 receptors are frequently mutated in T-ALL. Additionally, Notch3 overexpression also contributes to aberrant Notch signaling in T-ALL. Therefore, Notch mutations play a significant role in the development and progression of T-ALL.",No
Is the protein FAK (Focal Adhesion Kinase) phosphorylated?,Yes,"The protein FAK (Focal Adhesion Kinase) undergoes phosphorylation on both tyrosine and serine residues following cell activation. This phosphorylation is tightly linked to cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix through integrin receptors. FAK is a non-receptor protein tyrosine kinase that is localized to focal adhesions and plays a crucial role in regulating cell motility and adhesion. Phosphorylation of FAK at various tyrosine residues, particularly Tyr-397, has been identified as a key determinant in controlling focal adhesion turnover. This phosphorylation is also implicated in the regulation of growth factors that promote cellular adhesion, mobility, and survival, making it a significant factor in tumor development.",Yes
Does ghrelin play a role in ischemic stroke?,Yes,"Ghrelin has been shown to have a significant neuroprotective effect against ischemic stroke in preclinical studies. It has been demonstrated to improve functional and histological endpoints of stroke outcome in animal models of cerebral ischemia, and its proposed mechanisms of action include anti-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory effects. Specifically, post-stroke treatment with des-acylated ghrelin, but not acylated ghrelin, has been shown to protect against ischemia/reperfusion-induced brain injury and swelling, and blood-brain barrier disruption, by reducing oxidative and/or nitrosative damage. Additionally, ghrelin has been shown to improve neuronal cell survival and rescue memory deficits in animal models of focal cerebral ischemia. These findings suggest that ghrelin may be a useful therapeutic intervention for ischemic stroke in the clinic.",Yes
Is LPS a microbial product?,Yes,"Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a microbial product, as it is a major component of the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria. LPS is an endotoxin that is released from the outer membrane of these bacteria during infections. It is a bacterial endotoxin that can participate in the induction of inflammatory responses. LPS is a highly conserved component of the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria, and it contains important structural differences among different bacterial species that can significantly alter host responses. LPS is also a key inflammatory mediator, and it has the ability to turn on the production of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) in macrophage cells.",Yes
Has field-programmable gate array (FPGA) technology been used to solve sequence alignment problems?,Yes,"Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) technology has been utilized to address sequence alignment problems, as evidenced by the development of fast yet flexible alignment designs that exploit the reconfigurability of FPGAs. The runtime reconfigurable architecture has been proposed for accelerating short read alignment using FPGAs, and a systolic array-based FPGA parallel architecture has been designed for the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) algorithm. FPGAs, which contain millions of programmable logic gates, have been considered as accelerators for compute-intensive applications, including sequence alignment problems. The MSA-PAD application, a DNA multiple sequence alignment framework, has been developed using FPGAs to align DNA sequences encoding protein domains. Furthermore, a fast optimal global sequence alignment algorithm, FOGSAA, has been proposed, which aligns a pair of nucleotide/protein sequences faster than any optimal global alignment method, including the widely used Needleman-Wunsch (NW) algorithm.",No
Is Achondroplasia associated with hearing loss?,Yes,"Achondroplasia is a genetic condition associated with various medical complications, including a significant incidence of hearing loss. This condition is caused by disordered endochondral ossification, leading to rhizomelic dwarfism and midfacial hypoplasia. Temporal bone and middle ear structures are distorted in achondroplasia due to rotational changes of the skull base, contributing to hearing loss.

Sensorineural hearing loss is the most common form of hearing loss in individuals with achondroplasia. Cochlear nerve aplasia or hypoplasia is found in up to half of patients with unilateral or bilateral hearing loss. Otosclerosis is also a frequent cause of deafness in adults with achondroplasia.

Given the prevalence and severity of hearing loss in individuals with achondroplasia, regular hearing assessments are recommended as part of standard care. This includes assessments for adolescents and young adults, as few studies have investigated hearing loss in this population.",Yes
Is the JNK pathway activated during liver regeneration?,Yes,"The c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway plays a significant role in liver regeneration, as evidenced by its strong activation following partial hepatectomy. JNK1, a specific isoform, is crucial for liver regeneration in hematopoietic cells, and it also exhibits a synergistic function with hepatocytes during the hepatic regenerative response. JNK drives the transition of hepatocytes from G0 to G1 phase, with cyclin D1 being a downstream target of the JNK pathway during liver regeneration. Furthermore, JNK1 deficiency significantly impairs liver regeneration compared to JNK1(Îhepa) and wild-type animals. The JNK pathway is also activated by multiple profibrogenic mediators during toxic, metabolic, and autoimmune liver injury. These findings suggest that the JNK pathway is indeed activated during liver regeneration and contributes to this complex process.",Yes
Is STAT3 transcription factor regulated by mTORC1?,Yes,"The Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 (STAT3) transcription factor is regulated by mTORC1. The context suggests that mTORC1, a central regulator of cellular metabolism, cell proliferation, and immune response regulation, coordinates cell growth and metabolism in response to environmental input. The transcriptional activity of STAT3 in mammals is regulated by the deacetylase Sirt1, and mTORC1 controls cell growth and metabolism in response to nutrients, energy levels, and growth factors. Furthermore, mTORC1 regulates diverse cell functions and selects its substrates, including STAT3, by exerting its kinase activity on multiple substrates. Therefore, it can be concluded that STAT3 is regulated by mTORC1.",Yes
Is calcium overload involved in the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy?,Yes,"The development of diabetic cardiomyopathy is intricately linked with calcium (Ca2+) handling abnormalities and metabolic defects in cardiomyocytes. Intracellular Ca2+ overload, triggered by defects in sarcolemmal Na+-K+ ATPase, Na+-Ca2+ exchange, Na+-H+ exchange, Ca2+ channels, and Ca2+ pump activities, as well as changes in sarcoplasmic reticular Ca2+ uptake and release processes, can lead to the occurrence of intracellular Ca2+ overload. This overload is associated with depletion of high-energy phosphate stores, derangement of ultrastructure, and cardiac dysfunction. Moreover, impaired Ca2+ homeostasis due to altered SERCA and NCX activity, and altered mitochondrial Ca2+ handling, are features of type 2 diabetic cardiomyopathy. The progression of diabetic cardiomyopathy is also marked by a gradual decline in Ca2+ spark frequency and altered Ca2+ homeostasis, which may contribute to cardiac dysfunction and diabetes-associated endothelial dysfunction.",Yes
Is RIP1 (RIP-1) part of the necrosome?,Yes,"Receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (RIP1) is a key component of the necrosome, a signaling complex that mediates necroptosis, a type of programmed necrosis. RIP1 associates with RIP3 to form the necrosome, which triggers necroptosis. The RIP homotypic interaction motif (RHIM) of RIP1 and RIP3 forms an amyloidal complex in the necrosome. RIP1 plays a critical role in the initiation of necroptosis and is involved in apoptosis and inflammatory signaling. The interaction between RIP1 and RIP3 is required for necroptosis signaling, and the recruitment of additional RIP3 proteins to the RIP1-RIP3 heterodimer is necessary for necroptosis. RIP1 within the NP-40 insoluble necrosome is ubiquitinated, and cyld regulates RIP1 ubiquitination in this compartment. RIP1 kinase activity is controlled by cyld during necrosome assembly.",Yes
Is the protein KCNQ2 associated with idiopathic epilepsy?,Yes,"The protein KCNQ2, a voltage-gated potassium channel, has been reported to be associated with various types of epilepsy, including idiopathic forms. Mutations in the KCNQ2 gene have been identified in patients with benign familial neonatal seizures (BFNS) and early infantile epileptic encephalopathy (EIEE). Additionally, KCNQ2 mutations have been found to cause a rare monogenic subtype of idiopathic generalized epilepsy, benign familial neonatal convulsions. KCNQ2-related diseases range from autosomal dominant neonatal self-limited epilepsy to severe encephalopathies caused by KCNQ2 missense variants. Furthermore, KCNQ2 is closely related to neuronal excitatory diseases, including epilepsy, and acts as a drug target for the anti-epileptic drug retigabine. Therefore, the protein KCNQ2 is associated with idiopathic epilepsy.",No
Can RNAPolII function as an RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase?,Yes,"RNA Polymerase II (Pol II) has been shown to exhibit RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) activity. This enzyme, typically known for its role in DNA-dependent RNA synthesis during gene transcription, has been reported to also function in RNA replication. Evidence supporting this includes its ability to use a homopolymeric RNA template and extend RNA in the absence of DNA. Furthermore, Pol II has been implicated in the replication of RNA genomes of viruses such as Hepatitis Delta Virus (HDV) and plant viroids. The intrinsic RdRP activity of Pol II has been demonstrated using only pure polymerase, an RNA template-product scaffold, and nucleoside triphosphates. The mechanism by which Pol II uses RNA as a template remains unclear, but these findings suggest that it can indeed function as an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.",Yes
Does the Oncotype DX test work with paraffin embedded tissues?,Yes,"The Oncotype DX test has been demonstrated to work with fixed paraffin-embedded (FPE) primary colon tumor tissue, as evidenced by its use in a study involving 120 samples from August 2006 to November 2010. The test is a high complexity, multi-analyte, reverse transcription (RT) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay that measures the expression levels of specific cancer-related genes. It has been incorporated into the 2017 AJCC breast cancer staging system for ER-positive, HER2-negative, lymph node-negative patients to predict the risk of recurrence. The test is a widely used commercial assay that estimates the risk of distant recurrence and may predict the benefit of chemotherapy in a subset of breast cancers. The Oncotype DX test results have been shown to successfully guide adjuvant treatment given to patients in accordance with recurrence score-based recommendations.",Yes
Is the PTPN22 gene a biomarker for Rheumatoid Arthritis?,Yes,"Justification: The PTPN22 gene, specifically the rs2476601 genetic variant and the 1858C>T single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), has been consistently associated with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and other autoimmune diseases. The presence of the risk allele (1858T) is linked with an increased susceptibility to RA and other autoimmune disorders. Studies have also shown that PTPN22 gene polymorphisms are associated with RA in various populations, although the strength of association may vary among different ethnicities. Furthermore, the PTPN22 gene has been identified as a significant risk factor for human autoimmunity, contributing to approximately 1% of the familial aggregation in RA. Therefore, the PTPN22 gene can be considered a biomarker for RA, as it is a genetic factor that influences the risk and development of the disease.",Yes
Is marijuana use associated with increased risk for stroke?,Yes,"Evidence from epidemiological studies and case reports suggests a potential association between marijuana use and stroke, particularly in young adults aged 18-44 years. The odds of stroke were found to be 1.82 times higher in recent marijuana users compared to non-users, and this risk further increased to 2.45 times higher among frequent users (>10 days/month). The use of synthetic cannabis has also been linked to ischemic stroke in young adults. Although the precise mechanism of marijuana-associated stroke is not yet fully understood, marijuana is known to cause hypotension and impair peripheral vasomotor reflexes. Additionally, marijuana use has been associated with an increased risk of myocardial infarction (MI) immediately after its use. While the cause and effect relationship between cannabis use and stroke is not firmly established, these findings suggest a potential link between marijuana use and an increased risk of stroke, particularly in young adults.",Yes
Does fibronectin constitute a serum biomarker for Duchenne muscular dystrophy?,No,"Justification: The provided context does not explicitly mention fibronectin as a serum biomarker for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Instead, the focus is on the role of extracellular matrix (ECM) components in contributing to the severe fibrosis observed in DMD. The context discusses the quantification of several ECM components, including matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-1 and MMP-2) and their natural tissue inhibitors (TIMP-1 and TIMP-2), in primary DMD and control myotube cultures. However, fibronectin is not listed among the quantified ECM components. Therefore, based on the given context, it cannot be concluded that fibronectin constitutes a serum biomarker for DMD.",Yes
Are mutations in the STXBP1 gene associated with epilepsy?,Yes,"Justification: Mutations in the STXBP1 gene have been consistently associated with various forms of epilepsy, primarily early-onset epileptic encephalopathies. These mutations have been identified in patients with early infantile epileptic encephalopathy, early onset epileptic encephalopathy with suppression-bursts, and infantile spasms. The STXBP1 gene, which encodes syntaxin-binding protein 1, plays a crucial role in neurodevelopment and synaptic function. The variable clinical phenotypes caused by STXBP1 mutations are thought to be due to the pleiotropic impact of this gene on multiple neurological processes. Therefore, based on the available evidence, it can be concluded that mutations in the STXBP1 gene are indeed associated with epilepsy.",No
Is mitofusin 2 a receptor for parkin?,Yes,"Mitofusin 2, a mitochondrial fusion protein, functions as a receptor for parkin translocation to damaged mitochondria. This process is facilitated by a phosphorylated form of mitofusin 2. Parkin, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, is selectively recruited to dysfunctional mitochondria with low membrane potential in mammalian cells. Phosphorylated mitofusin-2 interacts with parkin to promote the ubiquitination of mitochondrial proteins, thereby initiating mitophagy. This interaction is crucial for maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis and promoting cell survival by removing damaged mitochondria.",Yes
Is there a relationship between thyroid hormone altered metabolism and coronary artery disease?,Yes,"The relationship between thyroid hormone altered metabolism and coronary artery disease has been suggested by observational studies, although causality remains to be definitively proven. Thyroid dysfunction, particularly hypothyroidism, has been associated with an increased risk of coronary artery disease, beyond that which can be explained by conventional cardiovascular risk factors. Changes in thyroid hormone concentrations can negatively affect the cardiovascular system, potentially leading to heart dysfunctions and altered concentrations of thyroid hormones. Thyroid hormones have been shown to affect the cardiovascular system, with thyroid dysfunction associated with arterial wall remodeling and increased cardiovascular risk. The precise mechanisms of their effects on the development of atherosclerosis are not entirely clear, but an unfavorable lipid profile may provide a possible explanation for the reported association of coronary heart disease with this syndrome.",Yes
Are microtubules marked by glutamylation?,Yes,"Glutamylation is a functionally important posttranslational modification of microtubules that is enriched on stable microtubules such as those found in neuronal axons, mitotic spindles, centrioles, and cilia. Microtubule glutamylation is catalyzed by a family of tubulin tyrosine ligase-like (TTLL) enzymes and is involved in the regulation of centriole stability, neuronal outgrowth, and cilia motility. The length of the glutamyl side chain is spatially controlled and microtubule type-specific, and a cell cycle-dependent gradient of glutamylation has been observed along the cell anteroposterior axis. The diverse populations of microtubule polymers in cells are functionally distinguished by different posttranslational modifications, including polyglutamylation. Strikingly, in the same cell, hyperelongation of glutamyl side chains stabilizes cytoplasmic microtubules and destabilizes axonemal microtubules. Microtubules can be deglutamylated by the cytosolic carboxypeptidase CCP1. In vertebrates, balanced activities of tubulin glutamyl ligase and cytoplasmic carboxypeptidase deglutamylase enzymes maintain organelle- and cell type-specific tubulin glutamylation patterns.",Yes
Is synapsin a phosphoprotein?,Yes,"Synapsin I is indeed a phosphoprotein, as it is a neuronal protein that is subject to phosphorylation and dephosphorylation events. This protein, with a molecular weight of 78,000 and 76,000, is localized to the cytoplasmic surface of synaptic vesicles and is involved in the localization and stabilization of these vesicles. Synapsin I serves as a substrate for cyclic AMP- and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases, further supporting its status as a phosphoprotein. The phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of synapsin I have been implicated in the regulation of synaptic transmission, demonstrating the importance of its phosphorylation status in neuronal function.",Yes
Is Thalidomide currently a marketed drug?,Yes,"Thalidomide is currently a marketed drug, having been reintroduced and approved by the FDA in 1998 for the treatment of erythema nodosum leprosum, a complication of leprosy. Despite its history of causing congenital birth defects, thalidomide has reemerged as a potential drug with newfound uses due to its unique anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects. It is now approved around the world for the treatment of various conditions, including leprosy, Crohn's disease, multiple myeloma, and certain malignant solid tumors. Thalidomide is an effective immunomodulatory drug in humans, although its mechanism of action remains unclear. It is a potent inhibitor of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-Î±) and has been found to have abilities against tumor growth, angiogenesis, and inflammation. Thalidomide is given orally, although parenteral administration would be desirable in some clinical situations.",Yes
Could BRCA gene test used for breast and ovarian cancer risk?,Yes,"The BRCA gene test is indeed utilized for assessing the risk of breast and ovarian cancer. This genetic test enables the identification of mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, which are associated with an increased susceptibility to these cancers. Women who possess a germline pathogenic variant in either of these genes have a significantly elevated risk of developing early-onset breast and ovarian cancer. Consequently, BRCA mutation screening is frequently offered to individuals who fulfill specific empirical selection criteria indicative of a genetic predisposition to breast and/or ovarian cancer. The results of this test can have significant implications for screening, prevention counseling, and health management decisions, including the potential for frequent surveillance, prophylactic surgery, and other interventions.",No
Has Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency an X-linked inheritance?,Yes,"Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is indeed an X-linked hereditary disorder. The G6PD gene, responsible for encoding the G6PD enzyme, is located on the X chromosome at position Xq28. This deficiency is primarily caused by one or more mutations in the G6PD gene, leading to abnormally low levels of the G6PD enzyme. As an X-linked disorder, males are typically either G6PD deficient or normal, while females may exhibit a broader range of G6PD deficiencies due to random X-chromosome inactivation, a phenomenon known as lyonization. This results in a mosaic expression of G6PD activities in their individual cells. G6PD deficiency is considered the most common human enzyme defect and one of the most common mutations in humans, affecting hundreds of millions worldwide.",Yes
Is the toxin produced by Clostridium botulinum always deadly?,Yes,", with exceptions

     The toxin produced by Clostridium botulinum, known as botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT), is indeed one of the most potent toxins known to humanity. It is responsible for the severe neuroparalytic disease botulism, which can lead to flaccid paralysis, asphyxiation, and even death. However, it is important to note that while the toxin is inherently dangerous, its lethality can be mitigated under controlled conditions. For instance, in the medical field, minute amounts of botulinum toxin are used for therapeutic purposes, such as treating muscle spasms and certain neurological disorders, as well as cosmetic procedures like wrinkle reduction. These applications require precise dosing and administration to ensure safety and efficacy. Therefore, while the toxin is generally deadly, there are exceptions where it can be used beneficially under strict medical supervision.",No
Is ocrelizumab effective for treatment of multiple sclerosis?,Yes,"Ocrelizumab, a humanized monoclonal anti-CD20 antibody, has demonstrated pronounced effects in reducing disease activity in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. Pivotal clinical trials have revealed good clinical efficiency of ocrelizumab while maintaining a good safety profile in the management of MS. The monoclonal antibody has been shown to reduce disability progression in primary progressive MS. Furthermore, two phase III trials evaluated the efficacy of ocrelizumab in patients with relapsing-remitting MS, demonstrating a significant reduction in annualized relapse rate, disability progression at 12 weeks, and gadolinium-enhancing lesions on magnetic resonance imaging. Ocrelizumab has been approved for the treatment of patients with relapsing MS (RMS) and primary progressive MS (PPMS).",Yes
Is there a role of regorafenib for sarcoma treatment?,Yes,"Regorafenib, a multikinase inhibitor, has demonstrated potential in the treatment of sarcoma, particularly non-adipocytic sarcomas. Clinical investigations, including the phase-2 Regosarc trial, have confirmed its efficacy in patients with leiomyosarcoma, synovial sarcoma, and other non-adipocytic sarcomas, but not liposarcoma. Furthermore, the Sarc024 phase II clinical trial has explored the use of regorafenib in specific sarcoma subtypes, including advanced osteosarcoma. The study met its primary endpoint, demonstrating the activity of regorafenib in patients with progressive metastatic osteosarcoma. In vitro studies have also shown that regorafenib inhibits cell proliferation and invasion in a dose-dependent manner. Therefore, regorafenib should be considered a potential treatment option for patients with relapsed metastatic osteosarcoma.",Yes
Is exon skipping correlated with exon circularization?,Yes,"Exon skipping is correlated with exon circularization, as certain genes leverage exon skipping events to generate RNA circles instead of relying on complementary sequences. This correlation arises from the competition between RNA pairing across flanking introns or within individual introns, which can regulate exon circularization efficiency. The process of backsplicing, triggered by base pairing of complementary intronic repeat sequences, brings intervening splice sites into close proximity, leading to exon circularization. The discovery of a systematic effect of exon length on RNA circularization further supports this correlation. The formation of circular RNAs through unique back-splicing of exons results in a closed covalent circular structure, distinguishing them from linear transcripts.",Yes
Is NADPH oxidase 5 expressed in rodents?,Yes,"NADPH oxidase 5 (NOX5) is a homologue of the gp91(phox) subunit of the phagocyte NADPH oxidase, which is widely distributed among the animal kingdom. The NAD(P)H cytochrome b5 oxidoreductase (Ncb5or), comprising cytochrome b5 and cytochrome b5 reductase domains, is also found in animals and contains three domains similar to cytochrome b5 (b5), chord-sgt1 (cs), and cytochrome b5 reductase (b5r). In a number of animal species, soluble NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase of erythrocytes was compared with membrane-bound NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase of liver microsomes by using an antibody to purified NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase from rat liver microsomes. Additionally, previous studies have shown that the reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH)-binding domain of rat liver microsomal steroid 5alpha-reductase isozyme-1 (r5alphar-1) is in a highly conserved region of the polypeptide sequence. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that NOX5 is expressed in rodents.",Yes
Does Vitamin D induce  autophagy?,Yes,"Vitamin D has been shown to induce autophagy through genomic and non-genomic signaling pathways, contributing to the maintenance of homeostasis by eliminating large protein aggregates and damaged organelles. The active form of vitamin D3, 1Î±,25-(OH)2-D3, promotes receptor activator for nuclear factor-ÎºB ligand (RANKL)-induced autophagy in osteoclast precursors (OCPs). Furthermore, 1,25(OH)2D3-induced autophagy plays a role in anti-inflammation and lipid metabolism modulation in the liver. Inhibition of p53 increased docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)-induced autophagy, suggesting that DHA-induced autophagy is mediated by p53. These findings support the notion that Vitamin D induces autophagy and can potentially prevent multiple human diseases and aging-associated dysfunctions.",Yes
Is RASA2 involved in melanoma?,No,"The context does not provide evidence that RASA2 is involved in melanoma. Instead, it focuses on the role of RAS isoforms (KRAS, NRAS, and HRAS), BRAF, and Pten mutations, as well as the expression of Rab22a in melanoma progression. The study investigates the prognostic value of HRAS mRNA expression in cutaneous melanoma and uncovers both activity-dependent and independent mechanisms of ARG-II in promoting melanoma progression. However, there is no mention of RASA2 in the context provided.",Yes
Is SUMOylation a post-translational modification in eukaryotes?,Yes,"SUMOylation is a post-translational modification in eukaryotes that involves the covalent attachment of a small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) protein to target substrates, specifically lysine residues in target proteins. This process is highly conserved across eukaryotes and is mediated by a series of enzymatic reactions involving activation (E1), conjugation (E2), and ligation (E3) enzymes. SUMOylation plays a critical role in regulating various cellular processes, including cell cycle progression, transcriptional regulation, nuclear location, and signal transduction. The reversible nature of SUMOylation allows for dynamic regulation of protein function and plays an essential role in eukaryotic growth and development. Proteomic studies have also demonstrated that orthologs of putative SUMOylated proteins in other organisms are similarly modified, indicating conserved functions for protein SUMOylation in early divergent eukaryotes.",Yes
Is Annexin V an apoptotic marker?,Yes,"Annexin V is indeed an apoptotic marker. It is a calcium-dependent protein that binds with high affinity to phosphatidylserine, a lipid that is exposed on the outer surface of the cell membrane during apoptosis. This binding property makes Annexin V a reliable marker for detecting apoptotic cells both in vitro and in vivo. It is widely used in flow cytometry-based apoptosis assays and has been labeled with various agents, such as fluorescent dyes and radioisotopes, to facilitate the detection of apoptotic cells. Furthermore, Annexin V has been used to identify apoptotic cells in various contexts, including tumors following chemotherapy and atherosclerotic lesions.",No
Is the protein lefty an inhibitor of nodal?,Yes,"The protein lefty is indeed an inhibitor of nodal. This conclusion is based on several lines of evidence. Firstly, processed forms of lefty proteins, both smaller and larger, have been shown to inhibit nodal signalling. Secondly, the expression of lefty, an inhibitor of nodal, is often reduced in tumor cells, suggesting a negative correlation between lefty and nodal expression. Thirdly, lefty-induced inhibition of nodal signalling can be rescued by excess actriia or actriib, indicating that lefty antagonizes nodal signalling through competitive binding to these common receptors. Furthermore, lefty overexpression in rcc cells inhibits the expression of nodal, leading to the inhibition of rcc cell proliferation and invasion, and the promotion of rcc cell apoptosis. These findings suggest that lefty plays a crucial role in regulating nodal signalling and may have potential therapeutic implications in cancer treatment.",Yes
Is Migalastat used for treatment of Fabry Disease?,Yes,"Migalastat, an orally administered small molecule, is approved for the treatment of Fabry Disease (FD) in patients with amenable mutations. It functions as a pharmacological chaperone, restoring the activity of specific mutant forms of Î±-galactosidase, which is responsible for FD. Migalastat has been approved for long-term treatment of adults and adolescents aged â¥16 years with a confirmed diagnosis of FD. It offers promise as a first-in-class oral monotherapy alternative to intravenous enzyme replacement therapy for patients with FD and amenable mutations. Clinical trials have demonstrated that migalastat substantially increases alpha-galactosidase-a activity, stabilizes related serum biomarkers, and improves cardiac integrity in male and female patients with amenable FD mutations.",Yes
Do statins cause diabetes?,Yes,"Recent studies have indicated an association between statin use and an increased risk of new-onset diabetes mellitus. The diabetogenic action of statins remains a concern, particularly in patients at high risk for diabetes receiving intensive statin therapy. The effect of statins to increase diabetes risk appears to extend to populations at high risk for diabetes. The prevalence of statin-induced new onset of diabetes is 7.03%. These findings further support the link between statin use and new-onset diabetes and suggest that the understanding of diabetes risk associated with different antihypertensive drug classes may bear practice modification. The increased risk of new-onset diabetes with statin use, including high-potency statins, is well known.",Yes
Are deletions of chromosomal regulatory boundaries associated with congenital disease?,Yes,"Justification: Deletions of chromosomal regulatory boundaries can lead to abnormal expression of key developmental genes, which may underlie various developmental abnormalities and congenital defects. Chromosomal rearrangements causing microdeletions and microduplications are a major cause of congenital malformations and mental retardation. The deletion of regulatory boundaries can disrupt the normal gene expression and lead to the loss of one copy of several known disease genes, which are associated with various congenital diseases such as mental retardation, facial abnormalities, and limb abnormalities. Identifying the genes that underlie the pathogenesis of chromosome deletion and duplication syndromes is challenging due to the large number of genes that can be affected. However, the ascertainment of individuals with overlapping deletions and varying clinical features may allow researchers to narrow down the region in which to search for candidate genes.",Yes
Can the Micro-C XL method achieve mononucleosome resolution?,Yes,"The Micro-C XL method, an improved technique for analyzing chromosome folding, is designed to achieve mononucleosome resolution. This method employs a single assay to interrogate chromosome folding at length scales from the nucleosome to the full genome. The Micro-C XL method utilizes micrococcal nuclease (MNase) digestion of chromatin, which cuts linker DNA between neighboring nucleosomes, thereby generating mononucleosomes. This process allows for the mapping of chromosome architecture at nucleosome resolution in human cells. Furthermore, the Micro-C XL method increases signal-to-noise ratio by using long crosslinkers and isolating insoluble chromatin. This results in a detailed map of nucleosome positions and localization of contact domain boundaries with nucleosomal precision. Therefore, the Micro-C XL method is capable of achieving mononucleosome resolution.",No
Can Diabetes be caused by a defect in a potassium chanel?,Yes,"Evidence suggests that a defect in the potassium channel, specifically the KCNQ1 protein, can contribute to the development of diabetes. This protein functions as a potassium channel in pancreatic beta-cells, driving an electrical signal that facilitates glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Abnormal regulation of potassium permeability can lead to beta-cell depolarization, resulting in diminished insulin secretion, a characteristic feature of type 2 diabetes. Furthermore, low serum potassium concentrations have been shown to decrease insulin secretion, leading to glucose intolerance. These findings support the hypothesis that a defect in a potassium channel can indeed contribute to the pathogenesis of diabetes.",Yes
Is rucaparib used for ovarian cancer treatment?,Yes,"Rucaparib, a poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor, has been increasingly utilized for the treatment and maintenance therapy of recurrent ovarian cancer. Clinical trials have demonstrated its efficacy in patients with high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) and those with both germline and somatic BRCA mutations, as well as homologous recombination deficiency (HRD). Rucaparib has shown significant improvement in progression-free survival in patients with platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer who have achieved a response to platinum-based chemotherapy. Furthermore, it has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Commission (EC) for use as treatment or maintenance for recurrent ovarian cancer. Rucaparib has also been found to have anticancer activity in recurrent ovarian carcinoma harboring a BRCA mutation or high percentage of genome-wide loss of heterozygosity. Overall, rucaparib appears to be a safe and effective option in the treatment of relapsed, advanced ovarian cancer.",Yes
Could hypophosphatemic rickets cause craniosynostosis?,Yes,"Hypophosphatemic Rickets can indeed cause craniosynostosis. Craniosynostosis is a condition characterized by the premature fusion of one or more of the fibrous joints between the bones of an infant's skull, known as cranial sutures. This premature fusion can result in an abnormal head shape and may cause increased intracranial pressure. Hypophosphatemic Rickets, a disorder characterized by defective renal phosphate reabsorption and abnormal bone mineralization, can lead to craniosynostosis. This is due to the hypomineralization of the bone caused by the deficiency or impaired metabolism of vitamin D, magnesium, phosphorus, or calcium. In particular, X-linked Hypophosphatemic Rickets (XLHR), the most common form of genetic hypophosphatemia, can occasionally cause premature fusion of cranial sutures through an increased level of fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23), which leads to the dysregulation of phosphate and vitamin D metabolism.",No
Is vortioxetine effective for treatment of depression?,Yes,"Vortioxetine is an antidepressant approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). Clinical studies indicate its effectiveness in improving depressive and cognitive symptoms associated with MDD, though there is no suggestion of superiority over active comparators. Vortioxetine is a potent antagonist of the 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor and serotonin transporter, functioning as an antidepressant in the treatment of MDD. Its multimodal pharmacodynamic profile differentiates it from other antidepressants. Vortioxetine has demonstrated beneficial effects on cognitive function, including executive function, in depressed patients in randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials. Preclinical and clinical observations further support its positive impact on cognitive function. Vortioxetine is considered a well-tolerated treatment, showing statistically lower withdrawal rates due to adverse events compared with other antidepressants. In summary, vortioxetine is an effective treatment option for MDD, particularly in patients who have not responded adequately to other antidepressants.",Yes
Can beans induce apoptosis?,Yes,"The consumption of common beans, particularly black beans and navy beans, has been associated with a significant reduction in colon cancer incidence and multiplicity. This effect is attributed to the modulation of 28 proteins related to apoptotic processes, which are triggered by the bioactive components found in beans. These components include polyphenols, flavonoids, and saponins, which have been shown to activate mechanisms involved in apoptosis pathways. The reduction of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), activation of caspase 3, cytochrome c release, and down-regulation of anti-apoptotic proteins (bcl-2, bcl-xl, mcl-1 and cflip) are all indicators of apoptosis induced by these bioactive components. Therefore, it can be concluded that beans have the potential to induce apoptosis.",No
Is treatment resistant depression related to vitamin B9?,Inconclusive,"Recent literature has identified associations between vitamin B12 and folate deficiencies with depression, as well as improvements in depressive symptoms when supplementing with B12 and antidepressants. However, the context does not provide explicit information on the relationship between treatment-resistant depression and vitamin B9 (folate) specifically. While deficiencies in both vitamin B12 and folate have been associated with depression, further research is needed to establish a direct link between treatment-resistant depression and vitamin B9 levels.",No
Is adalimumab effective for hidradenitis suppurativa?,Yes,"Adalimumab, a tumor necrosis factor-Î± inhibitor, has demonstrated efficacy in treating hidradenitis suppurativa (HS). The drug has been approved for the treatment of moderate-to-severe HS and is currently the only approved biologic therapy for this chronic and disabling skin condition. Phase 2 trials have shown adalimumab's effectiveness against HS, and further studies have confirmed its role as a first-line biologic agent in managing moderate-to-severe HS. Adalimumab's efficacy has also been compared to other inflammatory diseases, such as Crohn's disease, to evaluate therapeutic response rates and draw conclusions on its success in treating HS. Although some patients may experience flare-ups during treatment, the overall clinical efficacy and safety of subcutaneous adalimumab have been reviewed and supported in patients with moderate-to-severe HS.",Yes
Can NEECHAM Confusion Scale be used for evaluation of postoperative delirium?,Yes,"The NEECHAM Confusion Scale has been demonstrated to be a valid and useful tool for the early detection of postoperative delirium and confusion in surgical ward management. The scale has been used in various studies to assess the incidence and severity of delirium in patients following surgery. The trends of the NEECHAM scores in different patient groups have been compared, and the relationship between the scores and suspected clinical risk factors for delirium has been investigated. Furthermore, the NEECHAM scale has been found to discriminate for delirium and has been used in conjunction with other screening tools, such as the Confusion Assessment Method and the Nursing Delirium Screening Scale, to improve the prediction of poor outcomes following cardiac surgery. Therefore, the NEECHAM Confusion Scale can be used for the evaluation of postoperative delirium.",Yes
Is there an association between Muenke Syndrome and FGFR3 gene mutation?,Yes,"There is a well-established association between Muenke Syndrome and a mutation in the FGFR3 gene. Muenke Syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by coronal suture craniosynostosis, hearing loss, intellectual disability, and various craniofacial deformities. This syndrome is caused by an activating mutation in the FGFR3 gene, specifically the heterozygous pro250arg substitution mutation. This mutation increases ligand-dependent signaling and is the most common genetic cause of craniosynostosis in humans. The association between Muenke Syndrome and the FGFR3 gene mutation has been further substantiated by the use of a genetically equivalent mouse model for Muenke Syndrome, which has allowed for a better understanding of the pathophysiology of the syndrome.",Yes
Has small pox been eradicated from the world?,Yes,"Smallpox, caused by the Variola virus, has been declared completely eradicated by the World Health Organization (WHO) following successful vaccination campaigns through the 19th and 20th centuries. The eradication of smallpox was announced by the WHO in 1980, making it the first human disease to be eradicated. Since then, routine vaccination against smallpox has ceased, leaving the world population susceptible to diseases caused by other members of the Poxvirus family. However, smallpox has not totally disappeared from people's minds due to its potential use as a biological weapon.",Yes
Is there alternative polyadenylation during zebrafish development?,Yes,"Alternative polyadenylation (APA) is a widespread mechanism in eukaryotic gene regulation that generates mRNA isoforms with different 3' ends, leading to variations in coding sequences, 3' untranslated regions (UTRs), and poly(A) tail lengths. This process has been reported to play a crucial role in various biological processes, including embryonic development.

In the context of zebrafish development, the comprehensive list of developmentally regulated genes and their expression profiles during embryogenesis suggests the possibility of alternative polyadenylation. The temporal expression of several thousand previously uncharacterized genes, as well as the microarray analysis employed to study the temporal activity of developmentally regulated genes during zebrafish embryogenesis, further supports this notion.

Moreover, the use of whole mount in situ hybridization to detect the transcripts of genes such as ef-2, beta3, alpha2, and alpha7 during zebrafish embryonic development indicates the potential for APA. These techniques can reveal the presence of multiple mRNA isoforms, which could result from alternative polyadenylation events.

Overall, while the context does not provide direct evidence of alternative polyadenylation during zebrafish development, the available information suggests that this process could occur and contribute to the complex gene regulatory networks governing zebrafish embryogenesis.",Yes
Are alterations in ultraconserved elements implicated in breast cancer?,Yes,"Alterations in ultraconserved elements (UCEs) have been implicated in breast cancer. UCEs are highly conserved genomic regions that are resistant to evolutionary changes, and their dysregulation has been linked to various diseases, including cancer. In breast cancer, limited studies have indicated pathogenic changes in the expressions of some repeat elements, which include UCEs. These changes may contribute to epigenetic dysregulation, a well-recognized factor in breast cancer pathogenesis. Furthermore, genomic alterations in breast carcinomas, such as amplifications, deletions, and gene mutations, may also affect UCEs, leading to aberrant DNA methylation levels. However, the mechanisms underlying these alterations and their impact on breast cancer risk are not yet fully understood.",Yes
Is there any tool that facilitates the functional analysis of cis-regulatory regions in zebrafish?,Yes,"The zebrafish system has recently emerged as a useful tool for understanding vertebrate developmental genetics. To fully exploit its potential, efficient tools for genomic analysis are necessary. Microarray analysis has been employed to study the temporal activity of developmentally regulated genes during zebrafish embryogenesis. This technique provides a guide for functional analysis of neuronal activity, plasticity, and neural development in the zebrafish brain. Despite limited genetic techniques for conditional analysis of gene function, the zebrafish is a powerful model vertebrate amenable to high throughput in vivo genetic analyses. Detailed protocols for proteomics in zebrafish, including mass spectrometry identification of zebrafish proteins, have been provided. These methodologies promise to enable new zebrafish models for interrogating human physiology and disease. Therefore, it can be inferred that tools exist to facilitate the functional analysis of cis-regulatory regions in zebrafish.",No
Has whole exome sequencing been performed in Alzheimer patients?,Yes,"Whole exome sequencing has indeed been performed in Alzheimer's patients, as evidenced by the utilization of this technology in a study involving Han Chinese patients with familial and/or early-onset Alzheimer's disease. In this study, deep whole-exome sequencing was conducted on postmortem hippocampal formation and matched blood samples from 52 patients with Alzheimer's disease and 11 individuals not affected by the disease. The results of this genome sequencing frequently identified multiple established or possible contributory alleles, demonstrating the utility of whole exome sequencing in identifying genetic variations in familial Alzheimer's disease.",Yes
Is Stat4 a transcription factor?,Yes,"Stat4 is indeed a transcription factor. It belongs to the Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription (STAT) family of proteins, which are known to be essential transcription factors that mediate the biological effects of cytokines. STAT4, in particular, is activated in response to IL-12 and plays a critical role in TH1 cell development. After being phosphorylated, dimerized, and translocated to the nucleus, STAT4 regulates the expression of various genes, thus functioning as a transcription factor.",Yes
Have the promoter regions of the genes implicated in Rett Syndrome been characterized with CAGE?,No,"The context does not provide explicit information on the characterization of promoter regions of the genes implicated in Rett Syndrome using CAGE (Cap Analysis of Gene Expression). The context focuses primarily on mutations in the coding regions of genes associated with Rett Syndrome, such as MECP2, CDKL5, and FOXG1. It does not discuss the use of CAGE or any other method to characterize the promoter regions of these genes. Therefore, based on the provided context, it cannot be confirmed that the promoter regions of the genes implicated in Rett Syndrome have been characterized with CAGE.",Yes
"Has ""RNA interference"" been awarded Nobel prize?",Yes,"RNA interference (RNAi) has indeed been awarded the Nobel Prize. The 2006 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded to Andrew Z. Fire and Craig C. Mello for their discovery of RNAi. Their work elucidated a fundamental mechanism for controlling the flow of genetic information, which has been of great scientific significance and has opened up new avenues for the development of novel therapeutics. RNAi is a natural process of posttranscriptional gene regulation that involves the silencing of genes carrying the same code as a particular RNA of interest. This process has been a subject of intense research since its first unequivocal description in 1998.",No
Is there any role for Pds5b in cohesion establishment?,No,"Pds5b is not directly involved in cohesion establishment. It is a cohesin-related protein that binds to the same chromosomal loci as the cohesin complex and plays a distinct role as a regulator of cohesion maintenance. Unlike the cohesin complex, which is required for cohesion establishment and maintenance, Pds5b is required only for maintenance. Pds5b is involved in sister chromatid cohesion and mediates the removal of cohesin from chromosomes during mitosis. It also plays a critical role during DNA replication that is distinct from its previously known functions. However, its role in cohesion establishment is not established.",Yes
Could plasmepsins be used as targets for developing anti-malaria drugs?,Yes,"Plasmepsins, a family of aspartic proteases, play a crucial role in the life cycle of malaria parasites. These enzymes are involved in various cellular processes essential for parasite survival, including hemoglobin degradation. Inhibition of plasmepsins leads to parasite death, making them attractive targets for the development of antimalarial drugs. The high sequence conservation between plasmepsins from different isolates supports their reliability as drug targets for new antimalarial chemotherapeutics. The identification and characterization of new plasmepsins and the results from recent plasmepsin knockout studies further emphasize their importance as potential drug targets. However, the development of effective plasmepsin inhibitors is complicated by their genomic diversity, which gives rise to a family of closely related targets rather than a unique target. Nonetheless, advances in antimalarial drug development, such as the application of the thermodynamic approach to the development of high-affinity plasmepsin inhibitors, are crucial for combating malaria.",No
Is avanafil indicated for treatment of erectile dysfunction?,Yes,"Avanafil, a phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitor, has been reported to have clinical efficacy in the treatment of erectile dysfunction (ED). This class of drugs, including sildenafil, vardenafil, tadalafil, and avanafil, is considered the first-line choice for both on-demand and chronic treatment of ED. Avanafil, in particular, has been shown to be effective and well-tolerated for the treatment of ED in doses ranging from 50 to 200 mg. An increase in dosage is associated with a significant rise in effectiveness, but not with significantly more adverse events. Avanafil has also demonstrated improvements in endothelial function and markers such as nitric oxide, cyclic guanosine monophosphate, and endothelin-1 levels, which are associated with ED. While the findings are controversial and patient satisfaction trials are lacking, avanafil has been proven to be a safe and effective treatment for ED, with possibly the fastest onset of action and fewer visual disturbances than its competitors.",No
Is there a role for gamma knife in treatment of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder?,Yes,"Gamma knife radiosurgery, specifically gamma knife ventral anterior capsulotomy, has been demonstrated to be an effective treatment option for patients with refractory obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). This non-invasive procedure, which targets specific areas of the brain, has been shown to minimize side effects while maintaining the efficacy of traditional thermocoagulation techniques. Gamma knife radiosurgery has been increasingly used for treating patients with refractory OCD, as well as other neurological disorders such as tremor and trigeminal neuralgia. The procedure has been found to benefit patients with otherwise intractable OCD and may serve as an alternative to deep-brain stimulation in selected cases. It is important to note that the severity of OCD symptoms should be taken into account when considering gamma knife ventral anterior capsulotomy as a treatment option.",Yes
Can NADPH oxidase be inhibited by apocynin and diphenylene iodonium?,Yes,"Justification: NADPH oxidase can indeed be inhibited by both apocynin and diphenylene iodonium (DPI). Apocynin is a well-known inhibitor of NADPH oxidase, a powerful enzyme involved in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The inhibitory effect of apocynin is thought to be due to its ability to prevent the assembly of the NADPH oxidase complex, specifically the interaction between the p47(phox) and p22(phox) subunits. DPI, on the other hand, is a broad-spectrum flavoenzyme inhibitor that inhibits NADPH oxidase by blocking the electron transfer from NADPH to the enzyme. DPI is also known to affect other oxidoreductases, but its inhibitory effect on NADPH oxidase is well-established. Both apocynin and DPI have been widely used in research to study the role of NADPH oxidase in various physiological and pathological processes.",Yes
Does NADPH oxidase 5 require any subunit for function?,Yes,"NADPH oxidase 5 (NOX5) requires subunits for its function. NOX5 is a member of the NOX family of transmembrane oxidoreductases, which produce superoxide and other reactive oxygen species. While the context does not explicitly state that NOX5 requires subunits, it is known that NOX enzymes typically require subunits for their function. For example, the gp91(phox) subunit of the phagocyte NADPH oxidase is a homologue of NOX5, and the phagocyte NADPH oxidase requires several subunits for its function. Additionally, the context mentions that the mitochondrial rotenone-sensitive NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (Complex I) comprises more than 35 subunits, the majority of which are encoded by the nucleus. This suggests that NOX5, like other oxidoreductases, may require subunits for its function.",Yes
Is NSD-1015 an inhibitor of Aromatic L-Amino Acid Decarboxylase?,Yes,"NSD-1015 is a centrally acting aromatic amino acid dopa decarboxylase (AADC) inhibitor. The compound, 3-hydroxybenzyl hydrazine, is widely used to study the neurotransmitter-like actions of L-dopa. Evidence suggests that NSD-1015 blocks central AADC activity, as pretreatment with the inhibitor leads to a significant inhibition of dopamine formation and an elevation of L-dopa levels in plasma. Furthermore, the administration of NSD-1015 results in a dose-dependent inhibition of hepatic de novo lipogenesis. These findings support the conclusion that NSD-1015 is indeed an inhibitor of AADC.",No
Is pseudouridine a RNA modification?,Yes,"Pseudouridine is indeed a post-transcriptional RNA modification, which involves the isomerization of uridine to pseudouridine, a process known as pseudouridylation. This modification is introduced on the RNA by site-specific transglycosylation of uridine, mediated by pseudouridine synthases. Pseudouridine is the most abundant internal RNA modification in stable non-coding RNAs and is found in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes. It is a frequent nucleoside modification that occurs in both non-coding RNAs and mRNAs. The known molecular functions of pseudouridine include stabilizing RNA conformations and destabilizing interactions with varied RNA-binding proteins, suggesting that RNA pseudouridylation could have widespread effects on RNA metabolism and gene expression.",Yes
Do IEG create a ripple effect of transcription?,No,"The context does not provide evidence to suggest that intracranial electroencephalogram (iEEG) recordings directly create a ripple effect of transcription. Instead, the research focuses on the correlation between ripple oscillations detected in iEEG recordings of patients with epilepsy and the enhancement or disruption of verbal episodic memory encoding. The study investigates the relationship between the occurrence of ripple and spike events during word presentation and the odds of successful word recall following a distractor epoch. The results indicate an association of undifferentiated ripples with impaired encoding, and that iEDs are associated with an increase in low-frequency power and a change in the balance between low- and high-frequency oscillations for several seconds. However, there is no direct evidence to suggest that iEEG recordings themselves create a ripple effect of transcription.",Yes
Do T-Cells regulate neuropathic pain?,Yes,"T-Cells have been identified as significant contributors to the process of neuropathic pain. Specifically, regulatory T-Cells (Treg) have been found to play a crucial role in modulating the immune response at the site of peripheral nerve injury, thereby restraining the development of neuropathic pain. Treg cells achieve this through the inhibition of the CD4 Th1 response. Furthermore, T-Cells can release mediators such as cytokines and endogenous opioid peptides, which can either promote, suppress, or resolve pain, depending on the specific subset of T-Cells and the type of injury. The role of T-Cells in neuropathic pain is further underscored by the identification of IL-10 signaling as an intrinsic mechanism by which Treg cells counteract neuropathic pain development. However, the exact physiological significance and potential contribution of T-Cells to neuropathic pain remains a subject of ongoing research.",Yes
Can telomere length shortening be reversed by telomerase?,Yes,"Telomere length shortening can indeed be reversed by telomerase. Telomerase is a ribonucleoprotein that counteracts telomere shortening and can immortalize human cells. It is a reverse transcriptase enzyme that contributes to the maintenance of the telomeric structure by adding telomere repeat sequences to chromosomal ends, thus compensating for its shortening. This process allows critically short telomeres to be rescued and become fully functional, thus rescuing premature aging. The most common method of restoring telomere length is via telomerase reverse transcriptase activity, which is highly expressed during embryogenesis. Reconstitution of telomerase activity is proposed as a potential gene therapy to prevent or rescue age-related diseases produced by critical telomere shortening.",No
Is ABCE1 involved in ribosomal recycling?,Yes,"ABCE1, an ATP-binding cassette protein, is a crucial factor in ribosome recycling during translation. This process, orchestrated by ABCE1, is a fundamental step in protein translation and mRNA surveillance, linking termination with initiation. ABCE1's unique structure, including two FeâSâ clusters, enables allosterically coupled ATP binding and hydrolysis events that empower ribosome recycling. The protein's function is further enhanced by direct interaction with the peptide release factor ARF1, which promotes ABCE1's role in posttermination ribosome recycling. ABCE1 is highly conserved across archaea and eukaryotes, and its function in recycling terminated or stalled ribosomes is vital for mRNA translation. Therefore, ABCE1 is not only involved in ribosomal recycling but is also essential for life due to its fundamental role in translation initiation and/or ribosome biosynthesis.",No
Does oculocutaneous albinism show an autosomal recessive inheritance?,Yes,"Oculocutaneous albinism (OCA) is a genetically heterogeneous group of autosomal recessive disorders that result from mutations in genes associated with pigmentation. These mutations lead to either complete or partial absence of melanin in the skin, hair, and eyes. The inheritance pattern of OCA is autosomal recessive, meaning that an individual must inherit two copies of a mutated gene, one from each parent, to develop the disorder. This is supported by the fact that OCA is phenotypically and genetically heterogeneous, with mutations identified in several genes, including tyrosinase (TYR), OCA2, tyrosinase-related protein 1 (TYRP1), and membrane-associated transporter protein (MATP). Furthermore, analysis using the Pointer program has shown that this type of OCA is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, with an estimated gene frequency of 0.025 +/- 0.007 in the population. Therefore, it can be concluded that OCA shows an autosomal recessive inheritance.",Yes
Are Ultra-conserved elements (UCEs) enriched in segmental duplications?,No,"Ultra-conserved elements (UCEs) are not enriched in segmental duplications. In fact, research has demonstrated that nonexonic UCEs are depleted among segmental duplications (SDs) and copy number variants (CNVs). This suggests that their ultraconservation may reflect a mechanism of copy counting via comparison. UCEs are stretches of hundreds of nucleotides with highly conserved cores flanked by variable regions, and are identical between reference genomes of distantly related species. They are located in intergenic or intronic regions and are depleted from segmental duplications. These findings indicate that UCEs are not the exclusive property of higher modern eukaryotes, but rather transmitted from their metazoan ancestors.",Yes
Do normal cells express the protein TERT?,Yes,"Justification: In normal tissues, TERT is expressed in stem cells and progenitor cells, although its role in these compartments is not fully understood. TERT expression has also been observed in neurons throughout the brain during embryonic and early postnatal development. Furthermore, TERT protein levels are reduced with age, whereas its activity is increased in the nucleus. These findings suggest that normal cells do express the protein TERT, although its expression and activity may vary depending on the cell type and developmental stage.",Yes
Is there any involvement of the long non-coding RNA Gomafu in schizophrenia?,Yes,"The long non-coding RNA Gomafu has been implicated in the etiology of schizophrenia through its potential role in regulating alternative splicing of genes related to the disorder. The study identified Gomafu as an RNA-binding protein that regulates splicing efficiency by changing the local concentration of splicing factors within the nucleus. Furthermore, the findings suggest that Gomafu indirectly modulates the function of splicing factors SF1 and CELF3 by sequestering these proteins into separate nuclear bodies. The study also identified GRIN1, GSK3Î², and NRG1 as genes that may play a role in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia, and Gomafu has been proposed to modify mouse behavior through mild modulation of gene expression and/or alternative splicing of target genes. The potential role of Gomafu in schizophrenia is further supported by the finding that Regulator of G-protein Signaling 4 is regarded as a candidate gene for schizophrenia risk. The hypothesis of a gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) involvement in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia has been proposed but not confirmed, and the potential role of Gomafu in this process remains to be elucidated.",No
Is butterfly rash a symptom of Systemic lupus erythematosus?,Yes,"Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is characterized by various clinical manifestations, including an erythematous rash. The butterfly rash, also known as malar rash, is a specific type of erythematous rash that typically affects the cheeks and bridge of the nose, forming a butterfly-like pattern. This rash is a common facial manifestation of SLE and can often precede other signs of the disease. However, it is essential to note that other conditions, such as lupus vulgaris, lupus pernio, and seborrheic dermatitis, can also produce a butterfly-like rash. Therefore, a thorough clinical evaluation is necessary to differentiate SLE from other conditions that may mimic its symptoms.",No
Is infertility characteristic of individuals with Fanconi anemia?,Yes,"Fanconi anemia, a rare autosomal recessive disorder, is characterized by various clinical features, including reduced fertility. This condition is primarily caused by deficiencies in the Fanconi anemia pathway during DNA repair, leading to chromosomal instability, bone marrow failure, and developmental defects. The presence of heterozygous pathogenic variants in FANCA, a Fanconi anemia complementation group, has been reported to induce premature ovarian insufficiency (POI). POI is a condition characterized by the loss of ovarian function before the age of 40, often resulting in infertility. Therefore, infertility can be considered a characteristic feature of individuals with Fanconi anemia.",Yes
Is golimumab effective for ulcerative colitis?,Yes,"Golimumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody to tumor necrosis factor-Î±, has been approved for the treatment of moderate to severe ulcerative colitis (UC). Its efficacy as an induction and maintenance therapy for UC has been demonstrated in clinical trials, with good clinical response and remission rates observed in patients. The drug has an established exposure-response relationship in UC patients and has shown long-term efficacy and safety in clinical trials. However, it is important to note that more than 50% of initial responders may lose their response to the drug within the first year of therapy. Despite this, golimumab remains a viable treatment option for UC patients, particularly those who have not responded to standard treatments.",Yes
Does mTOR regulate the translation of MAPKAPK2?,Insufficient,"Information

The context provided discusses the role of mTOR in regulating translation through the phosphorylation of various proteins, including p70S6 kinase and eIF4E-binding proteins. However, it does not mention MAPKAPK2 as a target of mTOR-mediated translation regulation. Therefore, based on the given context, it is not possible to definitively state whether mTOR regulates the translation of MAPKAPK2. Additional information would be required to make a conclusive determination.",Yes
Do histone variant mH2A (macro-H2A) levels decrease upon differentiation?,No,"The histone variant mH2A (macro-H2A) does not exhibit a decrease in levels upon differentiation. In fact, macro histone variants, including mH2A, are expressed at low levels in stem cells and are up-regulated during differentiation. This suggests that mH2A plays a role in the differentiation process, possibly through its involvement in transcriptional repression and fine-tuning of gene expression. The nonhistone region of mH2A is responsible for both the repression of initiation of transcription and the inhibition of histone acetylation, contributing to its function as a strong transcriptional repressor. Furthermore, mH2A1 isoforms differentially regulate the expression of lipogenic genes by modulating the association of active and repressive histone marks on their promoters. These findings indicate that mH2A levels increase during differentiation, rather than decreasing.",Yes
Could divalent metal transporter 1 deficiency lead to anemia?,Yes,"Divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1) deficiency can indeed lead to anemia. This is due to the critical role DMT1 plays in iron metabolism and erythropoiesis. DMT1 is a major transporter responsible for duodenal dietary iron absorption and is required for erythropoiesis, the process by which red blood cells are produced. Mutations in DMT1 cause systemic iron deficiency, as it is essential for iron uptake in enterocytes and for transferrin-associated endosomal iron transport in many other cell types. The deficiency of DMT1 disrupts the normal iron homeostasis, leading to hypochromic microcytic anemia, a condition characterized by smaller and paler red blood cells. This is because iron is a crucial component of hemoglobin, the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen. Therefore, a deficiency in iron due to DMT1 malfunction can result in anemia.",Yes
Does the hERG gene code for a protein which is part of a sodium channel?,No,"The hERG gene, also known as KCNH2, codes for a protein which is part of a potassium channel, not a sodium channel. This gene is responsible for encoding the pore-forming subunit of the rapidly activating delayed rectifier potassium channel, which plays a crucial role in the repolarization phase of the cardiac action potential. The hERG channel is not involved in the initiation or propagation of action potentials, unlike voltage-gated sodium channels. Therefore, it can be concluded that the hERG gene does not code for a protein which is part of a sodium channel.",Yes
Is lenvatinib effective for renal cell carcinoma?,Yes,"Lenvatinib, a multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor, has demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC). The combination of lenvatinib and everolimus is approved by the FDA for advanced or metastatic RCC after one prior vascular endothelial growth factor-targeted therapy. Clinical studies have shown that lenvatinib plus everolimus and lenvatinib alone result in a progression-free survival benefit for patients with metastatic RCC who have progressed after one previous VEGF-targeted therapy. Furthermore, lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab has demonstrated promising antitumor activity in a phase I/II trial of RCC. Single-agent lenvatinib has also significantly prolonged progression-free survival compared with everolimus alone. These findings suggest that lenvatinib is an effective treatment option for RCC.",Yes
Does HuR bind to the untranslated regions (UTRs) of mRNAs?,Yes,"Justification: HuR, a well-characterized RNA-binding protein, is known to bind to specific subsets of mRNAs at their 3'-untranslated regions (3'-UTRs). The 3'-UTRs of these target mRNAs contain adenine- and uridine-rich elements (AREs), which are recognized and bound by HuR. This binding plays a crucial role in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression, as it influences the stability, translation, and subcellular localization of the bound mRNAs. HuR's ability to bind to the 3'-UTRs of mRNAs has been extensively studied and is supported by a wealth of experimental evidence, including immunoprecipitation and cDNA array hybridization experiments.",No
Is H4K20 methylation associated with DNA replication?,Yes,"H4K20 methylation is indeed associated with DNA replication. This post-translational modification of histone H4 has been implicated in regulating diverse processes, including DNA replication. The methylation state of lysine 20 on histone H4 (H4K20) is linked to DNA replication, and it has been suggested that methylations of histone H3-K9 and K36 by Clr4 and Set2 are functionally linked to the DNA replication checkpoint via the accumulation of Mik1. Furthermore, the cell cycle-regulated histone methyltransferase PR-Set7 mediates monomethylation of H4K20 (H4K20me1). Studies have shown that newly synthesized H4 is progressively methylated at K20 during the G2, M, and G1 phases of the cell cycle, indicating a role for H4K20 methylation in DNA replication. Additionally, genetic, cytological, and genomic approaches have been employed to better understand the role of PR-Set7 and H4K20 methylation in regulating DNA replication and genome stability in Drosophila cells.",Yes
Does CRISPR inversion of CTCF sites alter genome topology?,Yes,"Recent studies have identified a correlation between the orientation of CTCF-binding sites (CBSS) and chromatin loops. Utilizing CRISPR/Cas9-based genomic DNA fragment editing and chromosome conformation capture experiments, it has been shown that the location and relative orientations of CBSS determine the specificity of long-range chromatin looping in mammalian genomes. In the context of protocadherin (pcdh) and Î²-globin gene clusters, CTCF sites located between enhancers and promoters function as an enhancer-blocking insulator by forming distinct directional chromatin loops. This demonstrates that CRISPR inversion of CTCF sites can indeed alter genome topology and affect the architecture of topological chromatin domains.",Yes
Is there a role of proton beam therapy in medulloblastoma treatment?,Yes,"Proton beam therapy has been established as a safe and effective treatment modality for medulloblastoma, among other brain tumors. The utilization of proton radiation enables precise delivery of radiation doses to the tumor target, thereby minimizing exposure to surrounding healthy tissues. This is particularly beneficial in the context of medulloblastoma, as it often occurs in the posterior fossa, a region containing critical structures such as the brainstem and cerebellum. The literature supports the use of proton therapy in managing medulloblastoma, with evidence suggesting its effectiveness in achieving tumor control while reducing the risk of long-term adverse effects, such as secondary malignancies and neurocognitive deficits. Ongoing research and development in proton therapy, including pencil-beam scanning techniques, further contribute to its potential role in the treatment of medulloblastoma.",Yes
Are there canonical marks of active chromatin in developmentally regulated genes?,Yes,"Recent studies have identified a chromatin state signature associated with active developmental enhancers. This signature is characterized by high levels of histone H3 lysine 27 acetylation (H3K27ac) and strong depletion of H3K27 trimethylation (H3K27me3). These marks are indicative of active chromatin and are found in regions of open chromatin, which facilitate transcription factor access to DNA. The recruitment of chromatin regulators and the assignment of chromatin states to specific genomic loci are crucial for cell fate decisions and tissue and organ formation during development. Furthermore, a subgroup of genes with active promoter chromatin marks and promoter Pol II but no evidence of elongation has been identified. These findings suggest that there are indeed canonical marks of active chromatin in developmentally regulated genes.",Yes
Are there methods for generating highly multiplexed ChIP-seq libraries?,Yes,"Justification: The context indicates that a novel method for ChIP-seq data analysis has been developed, which uses joint information from multiple related ChIP-seq libraries. This implies the existence of methods for generating highly multiplexed ChIP-seq libraries, as they are required to obtain such joint information. Furthermore, the context mentions the development of a nano-ChIP-seq protocol that combines a high-sensitivity small-scale ChIP assay and a tailored procedure for generating high-throughput sequencing libraries from scarce amounts of ChIP DNA. This suggests that methods for generating highly multiplexed ChIP-seq libraries have been developed to overcome the limitations of conventional ChIP protocols, which require large numbers of cells and substantial amounts of DNA.",Yes
Is Doxorubicin cardiotoxic?,Yes,"Doxorubicin, an effective anticancer agent, has been shown to have cardiotoxic side effects, which limit its therapeutic potential. The incidence of cardiotoxicity associated with its administration has been a major concern for decades and is recognized as a treatment-limiting side effect. The cardiotoxicity of doxorubicin is mainly caused by its metabolite, doxorubicinol, and is known to induce dose-dependent cardiotoxicity leading to adverse complications such as cardiomyopathy, cardiac dysfunction, and ventricular arrhythmias. The mechanism of doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity remains incompletely understood, but it is believed to involve the induction of death receptors in cardiomyocytes. Dexrazoxane is used to protect against doxorubicin cardiotoxicity.",Yes
Is the mouse Sry gene locus free of repetitive sequences?,No,"The mouse Sry gene locus is not free of repetitive sequences. In fact, the locus is characterized by two arms of a large inverted repeat, flanking a unique region containing the Sry protein-encoding exon. Additionally, the Q-rich domain of the mouse Sry protein is encoded by an in-frame insertion of a repetitive sequence composed mainly of CAG repeats. The presence of these repetitive elements within the Sry gene locus suggests a complex evolutionary history involving duplications, rearrangements, and possibly gene conversion events. The presence of multiple Sry copies in the laboratory rat, Rattus norvegicus, further highlights the variability and complexity of Sry gene organization in rodents.",Yes
Is Meis1 implicated in microphthalmia?,Yes,"Meis1 is indeed implicated in microphthalmia. This transcription factor is part of a genetic network involved in eye patterning and has been identified as a candidate for syndromic cases of ocular malformations, including microphthalmia. Haploinsufficiency of Meis1, which is characterized by reduced expression of the gene, has been shown to cause microphthalmic traits and visual impairment in adult mice. In the eye primordium, Meis1 coordinates retinal proliferation and differentiation by regulating genes responsible for human microphthalmia and components of the Notch signaling pathway. This evidence suggests that Meis1 plays a crucial role in the development of the eye and its dysregulation can lead to microphthalmia.",Yes
Can Pentraxin 3 predict outcomes of sepsis?,Yes,"Pentraxin-3 (PTX3) has been demonstrated to be associated with the severity and outcome of sepsis and septic shock. It has been suggested as a prognostic marker of mortality in severe sepsis, and its multimers have been shown to predict survival in patients with sepsis. PTX3 has been reported to significantly predict disease severity and mortality in sepsis, although its regulatory mechanisms are still unclear. The use of a single biomarker to predict patient outcomes is challenging due to the complexity and redundancy of the immune response to infections. However, PTX3, in combination with other biomarkers such as interleukin 6, procalcitonin, and lactate, has been investigated for its prognostic value in predicting the 28-day mortality rate in patients with sepsis or septic shock. PTX3 has also been shown to have an important predictive value for prognosis in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage. Recent studies indicate that high levels of PTX3 may be associated with mortality in sepsis. Therefore, PTX3 may be a robust biomarker to classify the disease severity and predict the 90-day mortality of sepsis and septic shock based on the latest sepsis 3.0 definitions.",Yes
Is ocular melanosis a risk factor for uveal melanoma?,Yes,"Justification: Ocular melanosis, also known as ocular/oculodermal melanocytosis, is a congenital periocular pigmentary condition that portends a higher risk of uveal melanoma. The excessive melanocytes in the uveal tract in ocular melanosis may provide the biological basis for susceptibility to the development of uveal melanoma. Patients with ocular melanosis who develop uveal melanoma have double the risk for metastasis compared with those without melanocytosis. The risk of uveal melanoma is greater in patients with melanocytosis oculi than in the normal white population, with an estimated incidence of 1 in 400 affected patients. Therefore, ocular melanosis is a recognized risk factor for uveal melanoma.",Yes
Is siltuximab effective for Castleman disease?,Yes,"Siltuximab has been found to be an effective treatment for Castleman disease, specifically for patients with idiopathic multicentric Castleman disease (iMCD) who are not infected with HIV or HHV-8. As a chimeric monoclonal antibody targeting interleukin-6 (IL-6), siltuximab has been shown to have a marked impact on the symptoms of mild or moderate iMCD. In clinical trials, siltuximab has demonstrated superiority over best supportive care alone in improving tumor- and symptom-related outcomes, as well as reducing levels of C-reactive protein, a biomarker for IL-6. While not universally effective, siltuximab has been shown to induce a response in a significant proportion of iMCD patients via IL-6 neutralization, with approximately 30% partial responses by radiographic criteria. In the absence of a cure, siltuximab represents a significant achievement in the management of this difficult-to-treat orphan disease.",Yes
Is the enzyme EPRS phosphorylated?,Insufficient,"Information

The context provided does not mention the enzyme EPRS, nor does it provide any information about its potential phosphorylation. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether EPRS is phosphorylated based solely on the given information. Further research or additional context is required to answer this question.",Yes
Is there a relationship between B cells and Multiple Sclerosis?,Yes,"Accumulating evidence supports a major role of B cells in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) pathogenesis. B cells contribute to MS pathology through various mechanisms, including antibody secretion, cytokine production, and antigen presentation to T cells. The precise roles of B cells in MS are not fully understood, but their involvement in the initiation and propagation of MS lesions is increasingly recognized. Molecular analyses have revealed significant overlaps between peripheral lymphoid and clonally expanded central nervous system B cell populations, suggesting that B cell trafficking may play a critical role in driving MS exacerbations. The contribution of B cells and their products to MS pathogenesis has long been debated, with some evidence suggesting both deleterious and beneficial roles in MS lesions.",Yes
Does Yersinia pestis causes a respiratory infection?,Yes,"Justification: Yersinia pestis, a gram-negative bacterium, is the causative agent of plague, a disease that can manifest as either bubonic or pneumonic plague. Following inhalation, Yersinia pestis rapidly colonizes the lung to establish infection during primary pneumonic plague, a fatal respiratory disease. The bacterium has evolved from Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, an enteric pathogen that normally causes a relatively mild disease. However, Yersinia pestis has gained the ability to induce a fulminant pneumonia, indicating its capacity to cause a respiratory infection.",Yes
Are the genes for marneral biosynthesis scattered in the genome of A. thaliana?,No,"The gene encoding CYP71A16, which is involved in the biosynthesis and modification of the triterpenoid marneral in Arabidopsis thaliana, is part of a gene cluster. This suggests that the genes for marneral biosynthesis are not scattered throughout the genome, but rather are organized in a specific region. This clustering of genes is a common feature in the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites in plants, including triterpenoids like marneral. The presence of a gene cluster for marneral biosynthesis in A. thaliana indicates that the genes involved in this process are likely to be co-regulated and co-expressed, facilitating the efficient production of marneral.",Yes
Is Dupilumab used for treatment of atopic dermatitis?,Yes,"Dupilumab, a monoclonal antibody, is indeed used for the treatment of atopic dermatitis (AD). It has been approved by regulatory bodies such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medical Agency (EMA) for the treatment of moderate-to-severe AD in adults. Dupilumab functions by targeting the interleukin-4 receptor alpha, which plays a significant role in the underlying inflammatory pathway of AD. Clinical trials and real-world data have demonstrated its efficacy and tolerable safety profile in managing AD. However, it is important to note that ocular adverse events are commonly reported with its use. Dupilumab is also the only biologic agent approved for the treatment of moderate-to-severe AD, making it a promising therapeutic option for this condition.",Yes
Does Jarid2 play a role in early embryo development?,Yes,"Jarid2 plays a crucial role in early embryonic development, as it regulates the methylation level of H3K27me3, a histone modification closely related to normal early embryonic development. Jarid2 is a member of the Jumonji demethylase protein family and functions as a regulator of early embryonic development and embryonic stem cell differentiation by modifying histone lysines. The protein has been shown to exert pleiotropic PRC2-independent actions during embryogenesis. Jarid2 plays a key role in regulating the expression of OCT4, SOX2, and c-MYC via modification of H3K27me3 expression during early embryonic development. Furthermore, Jarid2 is an accessory component of the polycomb repressive complex-2 (PRC2), required for the differentiation of embryonic stem cells. Inactivation of Jarid2 in endocrine progenitors demonstrates that it functions after endocrine specification. Overall, the evidence suggests that Jarid2 is an essential regulator of gene expression during early embryonic development.",Yes
Is PUVA therapy indicated for eczema treatment?,Yes,"PUVA therapy, which involves the use of psoralen (P) and long-wave ultraviolet radiation (UVA), has been increasingly utilized in the management of various dermatologic disorders, including eczema. Systemic PUVA therapy has been shown to be effective in treating chronic palmoplantar eczema, with both oral and bath PUVA using 8-methoxypsoralen (8-MOP) demonstrating efficacy. Local bath-PUVA therapy is also valuable in managing chronic palmoplantar eczema resistant to conventional topical treatments. Topical PUVA is an effective treatment for localized forms of eczema, psoriasis, and palmoplantar pustulosis, avoiding some of the undesirable side-effects of systemic psoralens. Oral PUVA is preferable for patients with hyperkeratotic eczema, while bath PUVA is more suitable for those with dyshidrotic eczema. Local PUVA (psoralen plus UVA light) is an effective outpatient treatment for patients with palmoplantar eczema or psoriasis. However, more data is needed on the effectiveness of local bath-PUVA therapy in palmoplantar eczema.",Yes
Do brown fat cells produce heat?,Yes,"Justification: Brown fat cells, also known as brown adipocytes, are specialized adipocytes that have a high capacity to convert metabolic energy into heat. This process is called thermogenesis, which is the production of heat in response to certain stimuli such as cold exposure or caloric overfeeding. Brown adipocytes express the genes required for heat production through the process of thermogenesis, which involves the oxidation of fatty acids to produce heat. The key cell type in brown adipose tissue (BAT) is the brown adipocyte, which is enriched with mitochondria and is capable of dissipating energy in the form of heat. The primary function of brown fat is to produce heat, and it does so by burning fatty acids through a process mediated by uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1). Brown adipocytes and the related beige adipocytes can expend energy, generate heat, and increase whole-body energy expenditure, making them important in regulating body temperature and body weight.",Yes
Is Melioidosis caused by the bacteriumÂ Burkholderia pseudomallei?,Yes,"Melioidosis is indeed caused by the bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei. This bacterium is a gram-negative, facultative intracellular, soil and water saprophyte that is primarily found in Southeast Asia and Northern Australia. It is the causative agent of melioidosis, a life-threatening bacterial infection that can manifest in various forms, including pneumonia, abscesses, and septicemia. The infection typically occurs after exposure to water or soil that contains the bacterium, and it can affect both humans and animals. The bacterium is known to have a high mortality rate, making melioidosis a disease of significant public health importance in endemic regions.",Yes
Can glyburide reduce cerebral edema?,Yes,"Glyburide has been shown to reduce cerebral edema through various preclinical and clinical studies. Its mechanism of action involves inhibition of the non-selective channel composed of sulfonylurea receptor 1 and transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily m member 4. In patients with large hemispheric infarction, intravenous glyburide has been found to improve some edema-related endpoints, such as midline shift, level of alertness, and NIHSS scores, with fewer deaths attributed to edema. Additionally, glyburide has been associated with reduced T2 fluid-attenuated inversion recovery signal intensity ratio on brain MRI, diminished lesional water diffusivity, and reduced blood MMP-9 levels. These findings suggest that glyburide is an effective and safe alternative to dexamethasone for the treatment of cerebral metastasis-related vasogenic edema.",Yes
Has the gorilla genome been determined?,Yes,"The gorilla genome has been determined, as evidenced by the assembly and analysis of a genome sequence for the western lowland gorilla. This research also involved comparing the whole genomes of all extant great ape genera. The draft genome sequence of Lactobacillus gorillae strain KZ01(T) isolated from a western lowland gorilla has been reported. Additionally, a 6.0-kb DNA fragment from Gorilla gorilla including the 5' part of the beta-globin gene and about 4.5 kb of its upstream flanking region was cloned and sequenced. These findings indicate that the gorilla genome has indeed been determined, contributing to the understanding of human evolution and gorilla conservation efforts.",No
Is vemurafenib used for thyroid cancer?,Yes,"Vemurafenib, a selective BRAF inhibitor, has been observed to exhibit promising clinical activity in patients with papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) harboring the BRAF(V600E) mutation. This drug has been shown to induce partial responses and stable disease in PTC patients who have become refractory to radioactive iodine. However, it is important to note that vemurafenib often displays limited efficacy in poorly differentiated and anaplastic thyroid carcinomas, possibly due to intrinsic and/or acquired resistance mechanisms. Furthermore, vemurafenib has been found to induce ER stress response-mediated autophagy in thyroid cancer, and autophagy inhibition may be a beneficial strategy to sensitize BRAF-mutant thyroid cancer to vemurafenib. Nonetheless, vemurafenib is considered a potentially effective and well-tolerated treatment strategy in patients with advanced PTC harboring the BRAF(V600E) mutation.",Yes
Are mutations in the C9orf72  gene associated with macular degeneration?,No,"The hexanucleotide repeat expansion in the C9orf72 gene is known to be associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). However, it has not been established that mutations in this gene are associated with macular degeneration. The context provided mentions several genes implicated in monogenic macular dystrophies, such as ABCA4, ELVOL4, PROML1, VMD2, PERIPHERIN/RDS, TIMP3, and XLRS, but does not include C9orf72. Furthermore, the text states that genes implicated in monogenic macular dystrophies are good candidate susceptibility genes for age-related macular degeneration (AMD), but none of these genes, with the possible exception of ABCA4, have been shown to confer increased risk of AMD. Therefore, based on the given context, it can be concluded that mutations in the C9orf72 gene are not associated with macular degeneration.",Yes
Is the number of described human nuclear mutations less than 50000?,No,"Justification: The number of known mutations in human nuclear genes, underlying or associated with human inherited disease, has exceeded 100,000 in more than 3700 different genes. This information is based on the human gene mutation database. Therefore, the claim that the number of described human nuclear mutations is less than 50,000 is false.",Yes
Is Musclin a secretory peptide?,Yes,"Musclin is indeed a secretory peptide, as it is derived from skeletal muscle and possesses a region homologous to the natriuretic peptide family. This peptide is found to be responsive to insulin in vivo and induces insulin resistance in vitro. Musclin was identified as a novel secretory factor by signal sequence trap of mouse skeletal muscle cDNAs, and both full-length musclin protein and its KKKR-dependent cleaved form were secreted in media of musclin cDNA-transfected mammalian cell cultures. Furthermore, musclin is found to bind with the natriuretic peptide clearance receptors. The expression of musclin mRNA is detected at high levels in fast gastrocnemius and plantaris muscles, but only as traces in soleus, a slow-twitch muscle. It is expressed almost exclusively in the skeletal muscle of mice. The pathophysiological role of musclin in humans remains poorly understood, but it is produced by myocytes in a highly fiber-type specific manner, and physiological changes in type IIB MHC lead to coordinated musclin expression.",No
Are cutaneous porphyrias inherited with a recessive pattern?,No,"Cutaneous porphyrias, as a group, are not inherited with a recessive pattern. The Mendelian inheritance pattern of acute intermittent porphyria, hereditary coproporphyria, and variegate porphyria, which can present with cutaneous manifestations, is autosomal dominant. This means that a single copy of the mutated gene is sufficient to cause the disorder. However, it is important to note that the clinical phenotype is heterogeneous, and the manifestation of porphyria cutanea tarda, a type of cutaneous porphyria, reflects both genetic and environmental factors. While a few cases of late-onset recessive porphyrias have been reported, these are exceptions rather than the rule.",Yes
Can methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene mutations cause homocystinuria?,Yes,"Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene mutations can indeed cause homocystinuria. This condition is characterized by elevated levels of homocysteine in the plasma and urine, which results from a deficiency in the MTHFR enzyme. The MTHFR enzyme plays a crucial role in the remethylation of homocysteine to methionine, using methyltetrahydrofolate as a cofactor. A deficiency in this enzyme can lead to hyperhomocysteinemia, homocysteinuria, hypomethioninaemia, and low methylfolate levels. Different MTHFR mutations can result in either severe homocystinuria as a multisystem disorder or moderate hyperhomocysteinemia, which is a common risk factor for various disorders. The c677t variant of MTHFR is a frequent genetic cause of mild hyperhomocysteinemia among individuals with low folate status.",No
Can valproic acid prolong survival of glioblastoma patients?,Yes,"Retrospective evidence suggests that valproic acid (VPA), an antiepileptic drug, is associated with improved outcomes in glioblastoma. VPA has been investigated for its anticancer properties in different tumors, including malignant gliomas. VPA is an antiepileptic agent with histone deacetylase inhibitor activity, which has been shown to enhance overall survival and progression-free survival in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma. Several clinical studies have reported that VPA could prolong survival of glioblastoma patients. In addition to its anticonvulsant and mood-stabilizing properties, VPA can also inhibit the growth of cancer cells. The results of a study suggest that chronic treatment with valproate may protect neuronal cells from damage caused by oxidative stress, which may be involved in the mechanism of action of valproate.",Yes
Is Cryptococcus neoformans a frequent cause of isolated skin infections in immunocompromised individuals,No,"Cryptococcus neoformans is not a frequent cause of isolated skin infections in immunocompromised individuals. While it can cause cutaneous manifestations of cryptococcosis, these are typically part of a systemic infection and not isolated to the skin. The infection often presents with meningitis, pneumonia, and skin lesions, and is most commonly seen in immunocompromised patients, particularly those with HIV infection. The presence of C. neoformans antibodies in adult human serum suggests that even immune competent individuals can have difficulty resolving an early cryptococcal infection, allowing for the establishment of a subclinical chronic infection. However, the primary manifestations of cryptococcal disease are pulmonary and central nervous system infections, with skin lesions being a less common presentation. Therefore, it is not accurate to say that Cryptococcus neoformans is a frequent cause of isolated skin infections in immunocompromised individuals.",No
Is Obeticholic Acid used for treatment of Primary Biliary Cholangitis?,Yes,"Obeticholic Acid (OCA) is indeed used for the treatment of Primary Biliary Cholangitis (PBC). It is a potent Farnesoid X Receptor (FXR) agonist that has been approved for the treatment of PBC in patients who have an inadequate response or intolerance to Ursodeoxycholic Acid (UDCA), which is the first-line treatment for PBC. OCA is a semisynthetic bile acid analog that regulates hepatic bile acid metabolism by inhibiting bile acid synthesis. It has been shown to improve liver excretion of bile acids in patients with PBC and has been approved as the only on-label alternative for patients with PBC who are intolerant or have a suboptimal response to UDCA. OCA has also been found to be effective in more than one-third of patients not responding to UDCA in a real-world context.",Yes
Does the word ovine refers to goats?,No,"The term ""ovine"" does not refer to goats. Instead, it pertains to sheep. This distinction is evident in the context, where it is mentioned that goats are primarily infected with bovine strains of paratuberculosis, while sheep are primarily infected with ovine strains. This indicates that the term ""ovine"" is used to describe characteristics, conditions, or organisms specific to sheep, not goats.",Yes
Does GATA-1 regulate ribosomal protein genes?,No,"The context does not provide evidence that GATA-1 regulates ribosomal protein genes. Instead, it discusses the role of the ga-binding protein (GABP) as a regulator of ribosomal protein (RP) genes. The context highlights that GABP, a heterodimeric transcription factor, acts as a strong positive regulator of several RP-encoding genes. It also indicates that GABP can have a dual role as a repressor or activator of RP gene transcription. However, no mention is made of GATA-1 in the regulation of RP genes.",Yes
Does the TOP2B/TOP2A expression ratio affect the response to AML chemotherapy?,Yes,"The TOP2B/TOP2A expression ratio can affect the response to AML chemotherapy. The context suggests that DNA topoisomerase II (TOP2) plays a role in the emergence of therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia (t-AML) and chromosomal translocations involving the MLL gene. TOP2-targeted drug treatments have been associated with these events. Moreover, recent studies have shown that altered expression of members of the BCL-2 family, which includes BCL-2, may account for apoptosis resistance to chemotherapy in AML. The BCL-2 oncoprotein has been suggested to be directly involved in the emergence of drug resistance by disrupting or delaying the apoptotic program and promoting tumor survival. The expression levels of proteins that affect the functional status of BCL-2 modify the prognostic impact of BCL-2, suggesting that the role of apoptosis in different cases of AML varies independently in the different cytogenetic subgroups. The remarkable clustering of t-AML breakpoints cannot be explained simply by DNA cleavage patterns but might result from potential interactions between TOP2 poisoning, apoptotic DNA cleavage, and DNA repair attempts at specific sites of higher-order chromatin structure in apoptosis-evading cells. Therefore, the TOP2B/TOP2A expression ratio may have an impact on the response to AML chemotherapy.",Yes
Is Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome usually diagnosed in older adults?,No,"Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (LGS) is not usually diagnosed in older adults. LGS is typically characterized as an age-specific disorder with onset between 1 and 8 years of age. It is a severe epileptic encephalopathy of childhood onset that usually continues through adolescence and into adulthood. The syndrome is often recognized by a triad of signs, including multiple seizure types, slow spike-wave complexes on electroencephalographic recordings, and impairment of cognitive function. The variable presentation and progression of LGS can make it difficult to recognize, particularly in adults. However, it is not typically diagnosed in older adults, as it is a disorder of childhood onset.",Yes
Is Beta-Thalassemia is associated with a mutation or deletion of the gene that codes for alpha globin?,No,"Beta-Thalassemia is not associated with a mutation or deletion of the gene that codes for alpha globin. Instead, it is caused by mutations or deletions in the beta-globin gene, leading to reduced or absent synthesis of beta-globin chains. This results in an imbalance of alpha- and beta-globin chains, causing the symptoms of Beta-Thalassemia. The mutations in Beta-Thalassemia can be point mutations or deletions, with point mutations being more common. In contrast, Alpha-Thalassemia is caused by mutations or deletions in the alpha-globin genes, resulting in reduced or absent synthesis of alpha-globin chains. Therefore, the claim that Beta-Thalassemia is associated with a mutation or deletion of the gene that codes for alpha globin is false.",Yes
Is diphosphatidylglycerol (cardiolipin) a phospholipid of the mitochondrial membranes?,Yes,"Diphosphatidylglycerol, also known as cardiolipin, is indeed a phospholipid of the mitochondrial membranes. It is a unique dimeric phospholipid that is primarily localized in the mitochondrial membrane. Cardiolipin is synthesized from cytidinediphosphate-diacylglycerol and phosphatidylglycerol, a process catalyzed by the enzyme cardiolipin synthase. This phospholipid plays a crucial role in mitochondrial function, particularly in the generation of cellular energy in the form of ATP. Cardiolipin is a major phospholipid in mitochondria and is involved in the assembly and activity of mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes. The biosynthesis of cardiolipin is absolutely dependent on cdp-diglycerides and requires the addition of divalent cations. The unique phospholipid composition of mitochondrial membranes, including cardiolipin, influences the structure and function of mitochondria. Mitochondrial dysfunction, which can be linked to alterations in phospholipids such as cardiolipin, is implicated in various disorders, including neurodegenerative, cardiovascular, and metabolic diseases.",No
Have studies shown that there is no link between DNA methylation patterns and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder?,Inconclusive,"Justification: The provided context does not explicitly mention any studies regarding the relationship between DNA methylation patterns and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). However, it discusses various genetic and environmental factors that may influence the risk of developing trauma-related psychopathology, such as PTSD and major depression. These factors include interactions between genes (sert and bdnf) and social environmental exposures, as well as the role of traumatic stress-related interference and self-medication in the development of major depressive disorder. Additionally, the context mentions the low-expression variant of the 5-httlpr polymorphism modifying the risk of postdisaster PTSD and major depression under specific conditions. Given that DNA methylation is a form of epigenetic modification that can influence gene expression, it is plausible that DNA methylation patterns could play a role in PTSD. However, without explicit evidence from the provided context, it is inconclusive to state whether studies have shown no link between DNA methylation patterns and PTSD.",No
Is POLD3 essential for mouse development?,No,"POLD3, a DNA polymerase delta subunit, is not mentioned in the given context as being essential for mouse development. The context focuses on the roles of various other genes and transcription factors, such as pbx1, dlx3, ptip, pax3, pax6, lhx3, and loxl3, in mouse development. These genes have been found to be essential for early embryogenesis, placental development, pituitary differentiation, and other developmental processes. However, the absence of information regarding POLD3 in this context suggests that it may not be essential for mouse development.",Yes
Are hepadnaviral minichromosomes free of nucleosomes?,No,"The study indicates that hepadnaviral minichromosomes are not free of nucleosomes. The results show that the nucleosomes along viral cccDNA in the minichromosomes are sequence-specifically positioned. Both transcriptionally active and non-transcribed minichromosomes contain the same number of nucleosomes and nucleosomal structure. However, the transcriptional regulatory region of the simian virus 40 minichromosome that is being transcribed in the cell is nucleosome-free, while that of the non-transcribed minichromosome is nucleosome covered. The nucleosomal spacing of the HBV minichromosome has been shown to be unusually reduced by approximately 10% compared to cellular chromatin. Furthermore, the HBV core protein is a component of the HBV minichromosome and binds preferentially to HBV double-stranded DNA, resulting in a reduction of the nucleosomal spacing of the HBV nucleoprotein complexes by 10%. These findings suggest that hepadnaviral minichromosomes are not free of nucleosomes but have a distinct nucleosomal organization and spacing.",Yes
Is Cri Du Chat associated with an expansion of a repeat with in the gene found on chromosome 5?,No,"Cri du Chat syndrome is not associated with an expansion of a repeat within a gene found on chromosome 5. Instead, it is caused by a deletion of genetic material on the short arm (p arm) of chromosome 5. This deletion results in the characteristic features of the syndrome, including a high-pitched cat-like cry, developmental delay, severe psychomotor and mental retardation, and dysmorphic features in infancy. The incidence of Cri du Chat syndrome is estimated to be between 1 in 15,000 to 1 in 50,000 individuals worldwide. The deletion can occur de novo or be inherited from a parent with a balanced translocation involving chromosome 5. The size and location of the deletion can vary, leading to differences in the severity and presentation of the syndrome.",No
Is it feasible to obtain DNA read lengths that exceed 30 Kb?,Yes,"Justification: The advent of long-read sequencing technologies has enabled significant progress in obtaining DNA read lengths that exceed 30 Kb. Notably, long-read sequencing with a single Oxford Nanopore Technologies PromethION flow cell per individual has been shown to achieve 30Ã human genome coverage and accurately assess tandem repeats, including the 10,000-bp Alzheimer's disease-associated ABCA7 VNTR. Additionally, the introduction of SMURF-seq, a protocol for efficiently sequencing short DNA molecules on a long-read sequencer by randomly ligating them to form long molecules, further supports the feasibility of obtaining DNA read lengths beyond 30 Kb. These technological advancements have paved the way for the next generation of genomics, driven by massively parallel sequencers capable of sequencing an entire human genome 30-times over in approximately a week.",Yes
Is osteocrin expressed exclusively in the bone?,No,"Osteocrin, not to be confused with osteocalcin, is a protein that is not exclusively expressed in the bone. While osteocalcin is a bone-specific protein synthesized by osteoblasts and plays a crucial role in bone mineralization, osteocrin is a protein that is expressed in various tissues, including skeletal muscle, heart, and adipose tissue. Osteocrin has been found to have a role in muscle development and regeneration, as well as in the regulation of energy metabolism. Therefore, it is not accurate to state that osteocrin is expressed exclusively in the bone.",Yes
Are alterations in ultraconserved elements associated with colorectal adenocarcinoma?,Inconclusive,"The context provided does not contain explicit information regarding the association of ultraconserved elements with colorectal adenocarcinoma. However, it discusses the role of genetic and epigenetic alterations, including DNA methylation and miRNA alterations, in the development and progression of colorectal cancer. Given that ultraconserved elements are highly conserved genomic regions that may be involved in gene regulation and have been implicated in various cancers, it is plausible that alterations in these elements could also contribute to colorectal adenocarcinoma. Further research is needed to establish a definitive link between ultraconserved elements and colorectal adenocarcinoma.",Yes
Is apremilast effective for psoriasis?,Yes,"Apremilast, a phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor, has demonstrated efficacy in patients with moderate to severe psoriasis. It has shown significant and sustained improvements in skin, scalp, nails, and quality of life over an extended period of 104 weeks. The drug has been found to be effective and safe for treating palmar-plantar psoriasis and plaques at other locations. Its efficacy has been observed in biologic-naive patients with psoriasis, with significant improvement versus placebo at week 16, sustained over 52 weeks. Apremilast has also been approved for the treatment of active psoriatic arthritis. The safety profile of apremilast is acceptable, with most patients adhering to the therapy despite minor side effects.",Yes
Is skin color affected by variations of the SLC24A5 gene?,Yes,"The SLC24A5 gene, which encodes a potent potassium-dependent sodium/calcium exchanger, plays a key role in human pigmentation. Variants of this gene, such as a non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphism, have been shown to correlate with lighter skin pigmentation in humans. The SLC24A5 gene is involved in skin and hair pigmentation and is associated with oculocutaneous albinism type 6 (OCA6) disorder. Deficient SLC24A5 activity results in OCA type 6 in humans, and similar to morphants, homozygous SLC24A5KO mutants have significantly reduced melanin content and pigmentation. SLC24A5 is among the known color-coding genes that participate in melanogenesis by maintaining pH in melanosomes. Genetic variations influencing human skin pigmentation alter melanosome biogenesis via ionic changes, and SLC24A5 expression has been found to be elevated in melanoma. In conclusion, variations in the SLC24A5 gene have been shown to affect skin color in humans.",Yes
Do circRNAs remain untranslated?,No,"Circular RNAs (circRNAs) have traditionally been considered as non-coding RNAs, lacking the ability to be translated into proteins due to their unique structure devoid of 5' caps and 3' tails. However, recent research has challenged this notion, revealing that a variety of circRNAs possess translational functions. These circRNAs can be translated to generate functional proteins, with the resulting peptides playing significant roles in the emergence and progression of human diseases. Therefore, it is inaccurate to assert that all circRNAs remain untranslated.",No
Is autophagy the process where bacteria ingest viral particles?,No,"Justification: Autophagy is not the process where bacteria ingest viral particles. Rather, it is an intracellular degradation and recycling process that occurs within eukaryotic cells, including those of animals, plants, and fungi. Autophagy involves the sequestration of endogenous or foreign components, such as damaged organelles, protein aggregates, and invading microbes, into double-membraned vesicles called autophagosomes. These vesicles then fuse with lysosomes, where their contents are degraded by resident hydrolases. Autophagy plays a critical role in maintaining cellular homeostasis, as well as in innate immunity against intracellular bacteria and viruses. However, some pathogens, including certain viruses, have evolved mechanisms to exploit autophagy for their own benefit, such as by using the membranes of autophagosomes for replication.",No
Is intraoperative radiotherapy used for treatment of glioblastoma?,Yes,"Intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) is indeed used for the treatment of glioblastoma. IORT is a technique that involves the administration of a single, large dose of radiation to the tumor bed during surgery. This approach has gained popularity as an adjuvant option to surgical resection in the treatment of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), a highly aggressive cerebral tumor with poor prognosis. IORT is used to increase the survival rate of patients with GBM. The technique has been employed in the treatment of malignant gliomas, and from 1987 to 1997, 32 patients with malignant gliomas were treated with IORT. However, it should be noted that the standard treatment for newly diagnosed glioblastoma is surgical resection with adjuvant normofractionated radiotherapy (NFRt) combined with temozolomide (TMZ) chemotherapy. IORT is typically used as an additional treatment option, and its effectiveness is still being studied.",Yes
Is tirilazad effective for treatment of aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage?,Inconclusive,"The efficacy of tirilazad for the treatment of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) remains uncertain. Although tirilazad mesylate, a nonglucocorticoid 21-aminosteroid, has been shown to reduce vasospasm following SAH and infarct size from focal cerebral ischemia in experimental models, its clinical efficacy in human patients is not definitively established. A prospective randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled trial was conducted at 41 neurosurgical centers in Europe, Australia, and New Zealand to test whether treatment with tirilazad would reduce ischemic symptoms from vasospasm and improve overall outcome in patients with ruptured aneurysms. However, the results of this trial are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context, leaving the question of tirilazad's effectiveness for the treatment of aneurysmal SAH unanswered. Further clinical trials and evidence are needed to establish the efficacy of tirilazad for this purpose.",Yes
Is dexamethasone recommended for treatment of intracerebral hemorrhage?,Yes,"Dexamethasone, a synthetic glucocorticoid, has been demonstrated to be beneficial for the treatment of intracerebral hemorrhage in various contexts. It has been evaluated for the treatment of intracerebral hemorrhage using a rat model of cerebral hematoma induced by intracerebral injection of collagenase. Dexamethasone is commonly used in neurosurgery practice, particularly in cerebral edema secondary to brain tumors, head trauma, and central nervous system infections. It has been used to manage brain edema in patients with intracranial abscess and to treat cerebral edema associated with brain abscess. Some studies have also demonstrated the role of dexamethasone in the medical management of chronic subdural hematoma. However, it is important to note that the indication and timing of pharmacological venous thromboembolism prophylaxis in intracerebral hemorrhage patients is controversial. If dexamethasone is used, even as a single dose during craniotomy, intraoperative blood glucose concentrations should be carefully monitored and hyperglycemia treated, particularly in patients at risk for glucose-mediated exacerbation of brain injury. Despite the limitations of current evidence, dexamethasone is routinely prescribed with antineoplastic agents to alleviate pain associated with chemotherapy and reduce intracranial pressure.",No
Is airplane stroke syndrome a common disease.,No,"Airplane stroke syndrome is not a common disease. The estimated incidence of stroke in the setting of air travel is 1 stroke in 35,000 flights. This low incidence suggests that airplane stroke syndrome is a rare occurrence. Additionally, the lack of data on the actual incidence, pathogenesis, and prognosis of stroke in commercial flights further supports the notion that airplane stroke syndrome is not a common disease. Furthermore, the fact that economy class stroke syndrome may be underdiagnosed and is an eminently preventable cause of stroke, implies that the incidence of airplane stroke syndrome may be even lower than currently estimated.",Yes
Is hydroxyurea usually used to treated infectious disease?,No,"Hydroxyurea, a derivative of hydroxamic acid, is not typically used to treat infectious diseases. Its primary applications are in the treatment of myeloproliferative disorders and sickle-cell disease. It is a well-known chemotherapeutic agent that has been used for the treatment of various myeloproliferative conditions over the past 20 years. Hydroxyurea is also used as an antitumor drug, either alone or in combination with conventional chemotherapeutics or radiation therapy. It is a low-cost, low-toxicity drug that is often used in diseases such as sickle cell anemia and different types of cancer. Despite its wide range of applications, there is no documented evidence to suggest that hydroxyurea is typically used to treat infectious diseases.",Yes
Can acupuncture cause spinal epidural hematoma?,Yes,"Justification: Spinal acupuncture, while generally safe, may be complicated by serious adverse effects such as direct spinal cord and nerve root injury, subdural empyema, and epidural abscesses. Spinal epidural hematoma is a rare complication associated with pain control procedures such as facet block, acupuncture, epidural injection, etc. The onset of severe spinal pain after spinal or paraspinal acupuncture treatment should lead to the suspicion of a post-acupuncture spinal epidural hematoma (PASEH), and a spinal MRI should be carried out. Although PASEH is very rare, with only six documented cases, it is a possible complication from acupuncture on the back.",Yes
Is edema a symptom of nephrotic syndrome?,Yes,"Edema is indeed a symptom of nephrotic syndrome. It is the most common presenting feature and is characterized by fluid accumulation in subcutaneous spaces, leading to swelling. The pathogenesis of edema in nephrotic syndrome is attributed to intravascular volume depletion, which results from the leakage of plasma water into the interstitial space. This process activates secondary renal sodium retention. While the exact mechanism of edema formation in nephrotic syndrome is not fully understood, it is often associated with volume overload or volume contraction. Additionally, hypoalbuminemia and sodium retention of the proximal tubule contribute to edema formation in children with steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome.",Yes
Is there an association between Histone H3.3 mutations and glioma?,Yes,"There is a significant association between Histone H3.3 mutations and glioma, specifically in pediatric and young adult high-grade gliomas. Recurrent mutations in the genes encoding histone H3 variants, H3.3 and H3.1, have been identified in high-grade gliomas arising in the thalamus, pons, and spinal cord of children and young adults. Distinct and recurrent mutations in histone H3.3 have been implicated in a high proportion of malignant pediatric brain cancers. The presence of mutant H3.3 histone disrupts epigenetic posttranslational modifications near genes involved in cancer processes and brain function. Despite extensive dysregulation of the chromatin landscape in histone H3.3 mutant pediatric high-grade glioma, the exact mechanisms driving tumor formation remain poorly understood.",Yes
Is Pfh1 a component of the replisome?,Yes,"Pfh1 is a multifunctional DNA helicase that is essential for the maintenance of both nuclear and mitochondrial genomes. Its role in promoting semi-conservative replication through telomeric DNA and its high telomere binding activity suggest that Pfh1 is involved in DNA replication. Furthermore, Pfh1 has been shown to have a role in DNA synthesis across hard-to-replicate sites and in lagging-strand synthesis with polymerase Î´ (polÎ´), which are both functions associated with the replisome. Additionally, Pfh1 has been shown to unwind RNA/DNA hybrids more efficiently than DNA/DNA, suggesting that it resolves RNA/DNA structures like R-loops in vivo, which is also a function of the replisome. Therefore, it can be concluded that Pfh1 is a component of the replisome.",No
Does the Abelson-related gene (ARG) gene encode for a serine kinase?,No,"The Abelson-related gene (ARG) encodes a protein that is a member of the non-receptor tyrosine kinase family. The ARG protein is closely related to the Abelson kinase (c-Abl) and shares similar domains such as the tyrosine kinase, SH2, and SH3 domains. The ARG protein plays important roles in cell morphogenesis, motility, growth, and survival, which overlap with the cellular functions of the c-Abl kinase. However, there is no evidence to suggest that the ARG protein functions as a serine kinase. The present studies demonstrate that the kinase domain of ARK1 autophosphorylates on serine and threonine residues when expressed as a recombinant fusion protein, but this does not imply that ARG itself is a serine kinase. Therefore, it can be concluded that the ARG gene does not encode for a serine kinase.",Yes
Is Prochlorococcus the most abundant photosynthetic organism?,Yes,"Prochlorococcus is the most abundant photosynthetic organism on Earth, particularly in the oligotrophic waters of the tropical and subtropical oceans. This marine cyanobacterium numerically dominates the phytoplankton community, accounting for approximately half of all photosynthesis in these regions. Prochlorococcus is a major contributor to global primary production, and its ability to adapt to highly stratified low-nutrient conditions allows it to thrive in the surface ocean. The genus Prochlorococcus is diverse and abundant, with distinct genotypes adapted to either low- or high-light niches, contributing to its remarkably large depth distribution in the oceans. Prochlorococcus is also the only extant photosynthetic prokaryote to possess a chlorophyll a/b antenna as well as phycobiliprotein genes, further enhancing its photosynthetic capabilities.",Yes
Is dupilumab an antibody targeting the IL-1 receptor?,No,"Dupilumab is a monoclonal antibody that targets the interleukin (IL)-4 receptor alpha subunit of the IL-4 and IL-13 receptor. It is a fully human monoclonal antibody that binds to the IL-4 receptor Î± subunit (IL-4RÎ±) of IL-4 heterodimeric type I and type II receptors. This binding inhibits IL-4 and IL-13 signaling, which are key drivers of type 2/TH2 immune diseases, such as atopic dermatitis. Dupilumab does not target the IL-1 receptor.",Yes
Does the histone chaperone ASF1 interact with histones H1/H2?,No,"Justification: The histone chaperone ASF1 has been reported to interact specifically with histones H3 and H4, playing a crucial role in their assembly and disassembly during nucleosome formation and remodeling. The interaction networks of ASF1, along with other histone chaperones such as CAF1 and HIRA, have been identified through proteomics surveys. ASF1 is known to directly bind to histone H3, and its interaction with histones H3 and H4 is essential for its function in vivo and in vitro. The geometry of the interaction between ASF1 and histones H3/H4 suggests that it likely blocks the H3/H3 interface of the nucleosomal four-helix bundle. Furthermore, mutants of histones H3.1 and H3.3 have been identified that are unable to interact with human ASF1a and ASF1b isoforms, but still competent to bind CAF-1 and HIRA, respectively. This evidence supports the specificity of ASF1 for histones H3 and H4, and there is no indication in the provided context that ASF1 interacts with histones H1 or H2.",Yes
Is Hepatic mesenchymal hamartoma usually a malignant tumor?,No,"Hepatic mesenchymal hamartoma is typically classified as a benign tumor, characterized by the proliferation of variably myxomatous mesenchyme and malformed bile ducts. This rare liver lesion occurs predominantly in infants and children and is often associated with uncertain etiology. Although some reports suggest a potential for developing into an undifferentiated distant embryonal sarcoma after incomplete resection, the malignant potential of hepatic mesenchymal hamartoma remains uncertain. The finding of aneuploidy and cytogenetic abnormalities in mesenchymal hamartoma has led to speculation that it may be a true neoplasm rather than a developmental anomaly or reactive process. However, the consensus remains that hepatic mesenchymal hamartoma is a benign tumor with uncertain malignant potential.",Yes
Are selenium supplements recommended for prostate cancer prevention?,Inconclusive,"The potential efficacy of selenium supplements for prostate cancer prevention is supported by preclinical, epidemiological, and phase III data. Both selenium and vitamin E have been suggested to reduce the risk of prostate cancer, with selenium being one of the most popular dietary supplements considered for this purpose. However, supplementation trials have produced conflicting results, and clinical trials have not demonstrated clear benefits in patients. The biological effects of selenium on normal or malignant prostate cells are not well known, and the form of selenium and mechanisms underlying protection remain largely unknown. Therefore, the recommendation for selenium supplements for prostate cancer prevention remains inconclusive.",No
Is there any involvement of L1 retrotransposition in the Rett syndrome?,Yes,"Evidence suggests that L1 retrotransposition is involved in Rett syndrome. L1 retrotransposition is a process that contributes to genetic variation and disease, with approximately 1/1,000 disease-causing mutations in humans being caused by de novo L1 retrotransposition events. Rett syndrome is a progressive neurological developmental disorder, and L1 expression has been shown to be increased in patients with Rett syndrome and schizophrenia. Furthermore, recent studies have demonstrated that L1 retrotransposition can occur within the human brain, leading to somatic mosaicism in the hippocampus and cerebellum. These findings suggest that L1 retrotransposition may play a role in the development of Rett syndrome.",Yes
Is Downs syndrome associated with decreased risk of leukemia?,No,"Individuals with Down syndrome (DS) have an increased risk of developing acute leukemia, particularly acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The low frequency of established genetic aberrations in DS patients may contribute to their increased risk of ALL. Moreover, patients with DS and standard risk ALL-DS have been reported to have inferior event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) compared to patients without DS (ALL-NDS). The genetic disorder DS is associated with a decreased susceptibility for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, and solid tumors, including lung cancers, have a markedly decreased incidence in individuals with DS. However, this does not extend to acute leukemia, as patients with DS have an increased risk of developing ALL.",Yes
Does PCSK9 (Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9) binds with HDL-receptor (HDL-R)?,No,"Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) is a serine protease that plays a crucial role in cholesterol metabolism by regulating the degradation of low-density lipoprotein receptors (LDLR) in hepatocytes. PCSK9 is secreted by the liver and binds to LDLR on the surface of hepatocytes, leading to their degradation and subsequent reduction in LDL cholesterol uptake. However, there is no evidence to suggest that PCSK9 binds to high-density lipoprotein receptors (HDLR). The function of PCSK9 is primarily limited to the regulation of LDLR expression and metabolism, and its role in HDL metabolism remains unclear. Therefore, it can be concluded that PCSK9 does not bind to HDLR.",No
Is apremilast effective for psoriatic arthritis?,Yes,"Apremilast, a small molecule and oral phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitor, has been demonstrated to be effective in treating psoriatic arthritis (PSA) in adult patients. The Psoriatic Arthritis Long-term Assessment of Clinical Efficacy (PALACE) clinical trial program findings have shown that apremilast is effective for treating PSA, with clinically meaningful improvements observed at week 16 and sustained improvements seen with continued treatment through 52 weeks. In patients with active PSA, apremilast has been shown to reduce circulating levels of proinflammatory mediators and increase anti-inflammatory mediators. Furthermore, apremilast has demonstrated effectiveness versus placebo for the treatment of active PSA in the PALACE phase III clinical trial program. These findings suggest that apremilast is a promising treatment option for PSA.",Yes
Is there any role of TBR1 in autism?,Yes,"TBR1, a transcription factor expressed in the cerebral cortex, has been identified as a causative gene in autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). Mutations in TBR1 have been repeatedly found in patients with ASDs, and it has been shown to regulate the expression of several candidate genes for ASDs. TBR1 controls a transcriptional cascade relevant to autism pathogenesis, and it plays a role in the regulation of amygdalar axonal connections and cognition. TBR1 mutations have been shown to induce diverse ASD-related molecular, synaptic, neuronal, and behavioral dysfunctions in mice. TBR1 +/- mice can serve as a suitable model for revealing how an autism causative gene controls neuronal circuits, neural activity, and autism-related behaviors. These findings suggest that TBR1 may play a role in the pathophysiology of autism.",Yes
Is sonidegib effective for basal cell carcinoma?,Yes,"Sonidegib is an approved hedgehog pathway inhibitor used for treating locally advanced basal cell carcinoma (BCC) that cannot be readily treated with surgery or radiotherapy. It selectively inhibits the smoothened protein and suppresses the growth of hedgehog pathway-dependent tumors. Sonidegib has demonstrated rapid efficacy and a manageable safety profile in clinical studies, including the BCC outcomes with LDE225 treatment study. The drug has been approved for the treatment of locally advanced BCC and is also being considered for metastatic BCC, depending on regulatory approval. Sonidegib, along with Vismodegib, is one of the two oral smoothened inhibitors approved for treating advanced BCC. However, it is important to note that mutation-related drug resistance has been observed in clinical use, and the drug's effectiveness may vary among patients.",Yes
Does RNA polymerase II have RNA cleavage activity?,Yes,"RNA polymerase II (Pol II) has been shown to exhibit RNA cleavage activity. This activity is facilitated by the same active site that is responsible for polymerization. The intrinsic ribonuclease activity of Pol II is stimulated by the transcription elongation factor SII, which promotes cleavage of nascent transcripts generated by Pol II when it is stalled at transcription arrest sites. This cleavage occurs in a 3' to 5' direction. Additionally, Pol II has been found to be associated with a 3' to 5' exonuclease activity that removes nucleoside 5'-monophosphates from the 3' end of transcripts in isolated ternary complexes. These findings suggest that Pol II not only has the ability to synthesize RNA but also to cleave it, playing a role in the proofreading and editing of the transcript during transcription.",Yes
Is there a sequence bias in MNase digestion patterns?,Yes,"Evidence suggests that there is a sequence bias in MNase digestion patterns. The use of micrococcal nuclease (MNase) for analyses of nucleosome locations in various organisms has revealed a positional bias of motifs in DNA sequences. This bias indicates not only the importance of the pattern but also suggests preferred positions for these patterns to occur. Furthermore, the interpretations of nucleosome positions and occupancies using MNase have remained controversial due to its sequence preference. Additionally, the presence of compositional heterogeneity in sequences implies that they have evolved under more general conditions than typically assumed, which may contribute to the observed sequence bias in MNase digestion patterns.",Yes
Is NEMO a zinc finger protein?,Yes,"NEMO, also known as NF-ÎºB essential modulator, is a regulatory protein that contains a zinc finger motif in its c-terminal half. This zinc finger is of the classical CCHC-type and forms a specific complex with ubiquitin, making it a bona fide ubiquitin-binding domain of the ubiquitin-binding zinc finger type. The zinc finger domain in NEMO is crucial for its function, as it acts as a protein-binding motif and is required for full NF-ÎºB activation. Therefore, it can be concluded that NEMO is indeed a zinc finger protein.",Yes
Does TFIIS affect nucleosome positioning?,Yes,"TFIIS has been demonstrated to contribute to nucleosome positioning in both gene promoters and bodies. The method employed in the study was capable of detecting subtle alterations in nucleosome positioning produced by the lack of TFIIS. The independent effect of TFIIS deficiency on nucleosome occupancy and fuzziness supports the existence of alternative chromatin dynamics during transcription elongation. Furthermore, TFIIS acts in the chromatin context and has been shown to play a role in Pol II transcription initiation. The general transcription factor TFIID, which includes TFIIS as a component, mediates transcriptional regulation through interactions with various regulatory factors and putative participation in reconfiguration of nucleosomes. These findings collectively suggest that TFIIS does indeed affect nucleosome positioning.",Yes
Is tretinoin effective for photoaging?,Yes,"Tretinoin, a retinol derivative, has been extensively studied for its efficacy in treating photoaging. Both 0.1% and 0.025% concentrations of topical tretinoin have been shown to significantly improve photoaging of the face in comparison to a placebo, with no significant differences in efficacy between the two concentrations. The medication has been reported to have anti-aging effects on photodamaged skin and has been used for a long time to improve photoaging, although it may take several months to show clinical changes. Tretinoin has been confirmed to produce an overall improvement in photoaged skin and decrease solar keratoses in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study. It is considered the best-tested retinoid for reversing photoaged skin. However, it is important to note that some transient, undesirable side effects may occur with its use.",Yes
Does TUC.338 inhibit colorectal cancer?,Insufficient,"Information

The context provided does not mention TUC.338 and its effects on colorectal cancer. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether TUC.338 inhibits colorectal cancer based on the given information. However, the context does mention that alpha-blockers, a class of drugs to which TUC.338 might belong, have been identified as potential colorectal cancer preventative agents. Further research is needed to determine the specific effects of TUC.338 on colorectal cancer.",No
Has ruxolitinib received FDA approval?,Yes,"Ruxolitinib, an oral selective Janus-associated kinase 1 (JAK1) and JAK2 inhibitor, has indeed received approval from the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The approval was granted in 2011 for the treatment of myelofibrosis (MF), a type of bone marrow disorder. Subsequently, in 2014, the FDA approved ruxolitinib for the treatment of hydroxyurea (HU)-resistant or -intolerant polycythemia vera (PV), another blood disorder. The drug's safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics have been extensively evaluated in both healthy subjects and patients, and it has demonstrated superiority over placebo and best available therapy in clinical trials.",Yes
Is scuba diving safe during pregnancy?,No,"Scuba diving during pregnancy is not recommended due to the potential risks involved. The fetus is not protected from decompression problems and is at risk of malformation and gas embolism after decompression disease. Pregnant women are also at increased risk due to changes in body habitus, affecting equipment fitting and balance. It is prudent to advise pregnant patients of the increased risk of diving problems for the fetus during pregnancy. While inadvertent exposure to recreational diving in early pregnancy is not a reason for pregnancy termination, the safest choice during pregnancy is to avoid diving. If a woman insists on diving during pregnancy, she should go to a depth of only 60 ft, and the duration of her dive should be half that recommended by navy dive table times. However, it is still not considered safe. Swimming during pregnancy is recommended as a safer alternative.",Yes
Does deflazacort have more side effects than prednisone?,No,"Deflazacort has been demonstrated to have a lower incidence of adverse effects than prednisone at equivalent anti-inflammatory doses. This synthetic glucocorticoid, an oxazoline derivative of prednisolone, exhibits fewer adverse bone and carbohydrate metabolic effects compared to prednisone or beta-methasone. In both short-term and long-term studies, deflazacort has shown similar efficacy to prednisone and methylprednisolone in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. The overall incidence of adverse events in deflazacort recipients is lower than that of prednisone or methylprednisolone recipients. Therefore, deflazacort is not associated with more side effects than prednisone.",Yes
Does echinacea increase anaphylaxis risk?,Yes,"Echinacea, a dietary supplement, has been reported to increase anaphylaxis risk in individuals with atopy. Up to 5% of surveyed atopic patients experienced regular ingestion of echinacea, and echinacea-binding IgE was detected in 19% of atopic subjects by skin testing and 20% with moderate to strong reactivity by RAST testing. This indicates the possibility of severe allergic reactions, even with first-time use, due to cross-reactivity with other structurally similar allergens. Therefore, patients with atopy should be cautioned about the risk of developing life-threatening reactions to complementary medicines, including echinacea.",Yes
Are neurexins localized at pre-synapses?,Yes,"Neurexins are indeed localized at pre-synapses. They are a family of cell adhesion molecules that primarily reside on the presynaptic membrane of CNS neurons. Neurexins play a crucial role in stabilizing and functionally maturing synapses, as well as shaping the molecular composition of synapses. They are known to engage with various postsynaptic ligands and form trans-synaptic complexes with neuroligins, which are strictly postsynaptic proteins. The precise synaptic localization of neurexins remains a subject of ongoing research, but their presence at pre-synapses is well-established.",Yes
Is there any role of 5hmC in T-cell development and differentiation?,Yes,"5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) plays a crucial role in T-cell development and differentiation. 5hmC is involved in promoting gene expression and is regulated by TET enzymes. The epigenetic modification 5hmC has been found to be enriched in enhancers and gene bodies, suggesting a potential role in gene regulation. Early and widespread 5mC/5hmC remodeling occurs during human CD4(+) T-cell differentiation, and 5hmC-mediated DNA demethylation is a key component of CD4(+) T-cell biology in humans. Furthermore, 5hmC is enriched in the gene body of highly expressed genes at all developmental stages, and its presence correlates positively with gene expression. The molecular role of 5hmC in gene regulation is not yet fully understood, but it is clear that 5hmC plays an important role in T-cell development and differentiation.",No
Are there ultraconserved genomic regions in the budding yeast?,Yes,"Justification: The context suggests that certain genomic regions in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae exhibit evolutionary constraints and might be involved in the control of ribosome biosynthesis. Additionally, origin sequences, which represent functional protein-binding sites, are conserved better than the surrounding intergenic sequence within the genomes of closely related yeasts. This implies the presence of ultraconserved genomic regions in the budding yeast, which have been conserved during evolution due to their functional importance.",Yes
Is davunetide being considered for the treatment of progressive supranuclear palsy?,No,"Davunetide, while a leading drug candidate being tested against tauopathy, has been found not to be an effective treatment for Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP). This is supported by a post-hoc analysis of a davunetide trial that did not find an association between davunetide and gait or cognitive measures in PSP. Despite PSP being a neurodegenerative disorder linked to tau pathology, and davunetide being an intranasally administered peptide currently being developed for treatment of Alzheimer's disease and related disorders, it has not proven effective for PSP. Therefore, it is not being considered for the treatment of PSP.",No
Is autophagy modulated in a circadian fashion?,Yes,"Autophagy is indeed modulated in a circadian fashion. Evidence shows that this intracellular degradation system exhibits robust circadian rhythm in mouse liver, accompanied by cyclic induction of genes involved in various steps of autophagy. The rhythmic activation of physiological autophagy appears to be regulated by transcription factor C/EBPÎ², which is crucial for nutritional and circadian regulation of autophagy gene expression. The circadian clock directly regulates autophagy genes through NR1D1 and also regulates transcription of C/EBPÎ² through PER1B. These findings reveal a direct link between nutrient and clock-dependent regulation of gene expression, shedding light on the crosstalk between autophagy, metabolism, and circadian cycles. Although the mechanisms underlying circadian regulation of autophagy are still unclear, it is evident that autophagy is modulated in a circadian fashion.",Yes
Is Drk essential for anesthesia-resistant memory (ARM) in Drosophila?,Yes,"Evidence suggests that Drk, the Drosophila ortholog of the adaptor protein Grb2, is essential for anesthesia-resistant memory (ARM) within adult mushroom body neurons. The mushroom bodies are a critical region of the fly brain involved in olfactory learning and memory. The drosophila memory mutant radish, which is specifically deficient in ARM, provides a molecular avenue to understanding this memory component. The activation of two Rho GTPases, Rac1 and Cdc42, underlies the forgetting of an early labile memory and a form of consolidated memory, respectively. Pavlovian olfactory learning in Drosophila produces two genetically distinct forms of intermediate-term memories: anesthesia-sensitive memory and ARM. ARM is formed after one or several consecutive training sessions, whereas long-term memory (LTM) is formed only after multiple training sessions separated in time. The drosophila learning mutant rutabaga, which has a reduced intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) concentration, is defective in short-term memory. These findings suggest that Drk plays a crucial role in the consolidation and maintenance of ARM in Drosophila.",Yes
Are TAD boundaries in Drosophila depleted in highly-expressed genes?,Yes,"Justification: In Drosophila, Topologically Associating Domains (TADs) are often separated by inter-TAD regions containing active housekeeping genes and associated insulator binding proteins. Borders between TADs are formed in regions containing active genes and clusters of architectural protein binding sites. However, the synteny blocks corresponding to the extremely late-replicating regions in the D. melanogaster genome consistently display two-fold lower gene density across different Drosophila species. This suggests that TAD boundaries in Drosophila are depleted in highly-expressed genes, as these regions have lower gene density and are associated with late-replicating domains. Furthermore, late-replicating domains in the Drosophila genome display unique features, including the presence of extensive domains of repressive chromatin that replicate extremely late and have conserved gene order. This further supports the idea that TAD boundaries in Drosophila are depleted in highly-expressed genes.",Yes
Is there increased recombination rate in human regulatory domains?,Yes,"Recent findings suggest that there is indeed an increased recombination rate in human regulatory domains. This is supported by evidence indicating that reiterated sequences in the human genome are targets for nonallelic homologous recombination (NAHR), which facilitates genomic rearrangements. Furthermore, crossing over in ectopic recombination, resulting in chromosomal rearrangements, was associated with 35-60% of recombination events and was stimulated 12-fold by m26. Additionally, there is an excess of recombination hotspots at imprinted regions, which is likely due to the presence of imprinted genes. These findings support the involvement of a combination of specific DNA sequences and epigenetic factors as major determinants of recombination hotspots in imprinted chromosomal regions.",Yes
Is enzastaurin effective treatment of glioblastoma?,No,", enzastaurin is not an effective treatment of glioblastoma as a monotherapy.

Justification: Enzastaurin has been shown to have anti-glioma activity in patients with recurrent high-grade glioma, but its efficacy as a single-agent treatment is limited. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that enzastaurin inhibits angiogenesis and has direct cytotoxic activity against glioma cells, leading to a dose-dependent inhibition of cellular proliferation and decreased cell viability. However, the median effective concentrations required for these effects are at the upper limits of, or above, the clinically achievable range. As such, enzastaurin may not be effective as a monotherapy for glioblastoma. Instead, combining enzastaurin with other molecularly targeted therapies may provide a more effective strategy for treating patients with malignant gliomas.",Yes
Is dasatinib effective for treatment of glioblastoma?,Yes,"Dasatinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, has demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of glioblastoma. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that imatinib mesylate, a related compound, inhibits glioblastoma growth. Dasatinib has been found to decrease levels of phospho-src, akt, and ribosomal protein s6 in human glioblastoma cell lines at low nanomolar concentrations, both at baseline and following stimulation with epidermal growth factor. Furthermore, combination treatment of glioma cells with dasatinib and temozolomide has resulted in a significant increase in cell cycle disruption and autophagic cell death. These findings support the clinical use of dasatinib in the treatment of glioblastoma and provide a rationale for combination therapy with temozolomide.",Yes
Has IVIG been tested in clinical trials for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease?,Yes,"Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) has indeed been tested in clinical trials for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The context suggests that IVIG therapy has shown promise in treating AD, with its efficacy being currently tested in mild-to-moderate AD cases. Preclinical and clinical studies have demonstrated that IVIG has anti-amyloid and immune modulatory properties relevant to treating neurodegenerative disorders such as AD. Moreover, IVIG has been proposed as a potential therapeutic agent for AD immunotherapy due to its content of antibodies against beta-amyloid (Abeta). Recent phase II and III studies with IVIG in AD patients, however, have not found evidence for the slowing of AD progression compared to placebo-treated patients, in contrast to encouraging results in pilot studies. Nonetheless, the therapeutic effects of IVIG products have been recently studied in AD patients, and clinical studies are ongoing to investigate the potential role of IVIG as a therapeutic agent in AD.",Yes
Does a tonsillectomy affect the patient's voice?,No,"Justification: The study aimed to investigate the impact of tonsillectomy on speech characteristics. The results indicate that tonsillectomy does not significantly alter speech intelligibility or velopharyngeal competence, even in patients with known velopharyngeal insufficiency. Furthermore, there was no remarkable change in the acoustical features of Japanese vowels after tonsillectomy. However, it remains unclear whether the enlarged dimensions of the oropharynx after tonsillectomy could impair the quality of a professional voice user's voice. Overall, the evidence suggests that tonsillectomy does not have a significant impact on a person's voice under normal vocal demand.",Yes
Do cephalopods use RNA editing less frequently than other species?,No,"Justification: The context does not provide explicit comparative data on the frequency of RNA editing across different species. However, it does indicate that cephalopods utilize RNA editing ""extensively"" to increase the regulatory complexity of their nervous systems. This suggests that cephalopods may not use RNA editing less frequently than other species, as they have been observed to employ this process to a significant extent. Further research would be required to make definitive comparisons with other species.",No
Is there an RNAi drug being developed to treat amyloidosis?,Yes,"Justification: There are several RNAi drugs being developed to treat amyloidosis. One such drug, Patisiran (ONPATTROâ¢), was approved by the FDA in August 2018 for the treatment of transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis. Additionally, Aln-ttr01 and Aln-ttr02 have demonstrated the ability to suppress the production of both mutant and nonmutant forms of transthyretin, establishing proof of concept for RNAi therapy targeting messenger RNA transcribed from a disease-causing gene. Furthermore, Vutrisiran (ALN-TTRsc02) is a liver-directed, investigational small interfering ribonucleic acid drug for the treatment of transthyretin (TTR)-mediated amyloidosis. These findings provide a rationale for further investigation of RNAi-based therapies for amyloidosis.",No
Is there an association between carcinoid syndrome and mitral valve disease?,No,"Carcinoid syndrome has been strongly associated with carcinoid heart disease, primarily affecting the right heart endocardium and valves. This condition is characterized by fibrous thickening of cardiac valves, leading to heart failure, and is typically characterized by tricuspid valve regurgitation and varying degrees of pulmonary valve regurgitation or stenosis. Although carcinoid involvement of left-sided heart valves has been reported in patients with a patent foramen ovale, carcinoid tumor of the lung, and active carcinoid syndrome with high levels of serotonin, there is no direct association between carcinoid syndrome and mitral valve disease. The diagnosis of carcinoid syndrome should be recognized as an etiology in patients with organic tricuspid and pulmonary regurgitation without left valvular disease.",Yes
Are there RNAi approaches considered for the treatment of kidney injury?,Yes,"RNA interference (RNAi), mediated by small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and microRNAs, has been identified as a promising tool for gene therapy and has shown potential for the treatment of various human diseases, including kidney disorders. RNAi-based strategies have been used to elucidate gene function and develop gene-based therapeutics for kidney diseases. Specifically, therapies based on siRNAs have shown promise for patients with glomerulonephritis, although tissue-specific protocols using siRNAs have not yet been established. RNAi targeting against TGF-beta1 has been found to significantly suppress TGF-beta1 mRNA and protein expression, thereby ameliorating the progression of matrix expansion in experimental glomerulonephritis. Additionally, RNAi targeting against RELB has been shown to significantly attenuate ischemia/reperfusion (I/R)-induced renal dysfunction. Overall, RNAi-based approaches have shown potential for the treatment of kidney injury, although further research is needed to address the challenge of in vivo delivery and specific targeting.",Yes
Is propranolol used for treatment of infantile hemangioma?,Yes,"Propranolol has been shown to be a highly effective treatment for infantile hemangioma (IH). It is a non-selective Î²-blocker that has revolutionized the treatment of IH, and is currently the first-line therapy for this condition. Oral propranolol at a dose of 2 mg/kg/day in two divided doses for 24 weeks has been demonstrated to be a safe and effective treatment for IH during the proliferative phase. Although there is no consensus on the recommended dosage for this condition, recent data suggest that oral propranolol therapy is a safe and effective choice in the treatment of IH before the age of 1 year. Propranolol has been successfully used in a limited number of children with IH, and its mechanism of action on regression of IH is being investigated. Despite the lack of important clinical and pharmacological data, propranolol remains a well-tolerated and effective treatment for IH.",Yes
Can the CEP290 gene mutations be targeted by AAV-mediated gene therapy?,Yes,"The CEP290 gene mutations can indeed be targeted by AAV-mediated gene therapy. Adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors have been demonstrated to be a promising gene therapy strategy for various diseases, particularly genetic disorders. Recent studies have shown that the genetic modification of AAV vectors may further facilitate the success of AAV gene therapy. Moreover, AAV vector-mediated gene delivery has been approved for the treatment of inherited blindness and spinal muscular atrophy, and long-term therapeutic effects have been achieved for other rare diseases. The successful construction and viral transfer of full-length CEP290 using lentiviral vectors brings us closer to the goal of providing gene- and cell-based therapies for patients affected with this common form of Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA). Furthermore, a novel strategy to dramatically increase AAV transduction has been demonstrated, which substantially enhanced in vivo genome editing efficiency in adult animal models, showing clinical potential for both conventional and genome editing-based gene therapy.",Yes
Are mutations in the nf1 gene associated with memory?,Yes,"Mutations in the nf1 gene have been found to be associated with memory deficits, particularly working memory. Studies have shown that mice with a heterozygous mutation of the nf1 gene (nf1(+/-)) exhibit learning deficits that are similar to those observed in humans with neurofibromatosis type 1 (nf1). These deficits are thought to be caused by excessive RAS activity, which leads to impairments in long-term potentiation caused by increased GABA-mediated inhibition. Additionally, nf1 patients have been found to have impairments in frontal lobe-based cognitive functions such as attention, working memory, and inhibition. Further research is needed to fully understand the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying these deficits and to develop effective treatments for learning disabilities associated with nf1.",Yes
Is ACI-35 a passive vaccine?,No,"Justification: ACI-35, or more accurately, Aeras-402/Ad35.TB-S, is not a passive vaccine. It is an active vaccine based on replication-deficient adenovirus serotype 35 (Ad35) as a vector, containing gene inserts for antigens 85a, 85b, and TB10.4. The vaccine was evaluated for its safety and immunogenicity in previously BCG vaccinated, HIV-infected South African adults with baseline CD4 counts >350 cells/mm(3). The vaccine was well tolerated and induced strong, predominantly polyfunctional CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-cell responses to the vaccine, as well as strong Ag85a and Ag85b specific antibody responses. These findings indicate that ACI-35 is an active vaccine that elicits an immune response, in contrast to passive vaccines which involve the administration of pre-formed antibodies or immune cells to provide immediate but temporary protection.",Yes
Is DNA methylation correlated with nucleosome occupancy?,Yes,"The evidence suggests a correlation between DNA methylation and nucleosome occupancy, as demonstrated by the observed positive relationship between increasing methylated CpG density and nucleosome occupancy throughout the genome and in nearly all subgenomic regions. This relationship is hypothesized to be mediated by methylation-induced conformational changes in DNA that facilitate nucleosome formation, thereby altering chromatin density. Additionally, the density of CpGs within nucleosomes has been shown to influence the nucleosomal location of DNA methylation, with low CpG frequencies favoring linker methylation and high CpG frequencies favoring core particle methylation. These findings support the notion that DNA methylation is associated with nucleosome occupancy, although the debate on its reliability as an indicator of high nucleosome occupancy remains unsettled.",Yes
Does DDX54 play a role in DNA damage response?,No,"The context provided does not indicate a role for DDX54 in DNA damage response. Instead, it discusses the roles of DDX3X and DDX52 in the DNA damage response, as well as the damaged DNA-binding protein (DDB) heterodimer in nucleotide excision repair. DDX54 is not mentioned in the context, and no information is provided regarding its potential involvement in DNA damage response. Therefore, based on the available information, it is not possible to conclude that DDX54 plays a role in DNA damage response.",Yes
Do bacteria from the genus Morexella cause respiratory infections?,Yes,"Moraxella (formerly Branhamella) catarrhalis is a recognized pathogen in respiratory infections, particularly in patients with chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD). This Gram-negative coccus has emerged as a significant cause of upper and lower respiratory tract infections, including otitis media and acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis. Moraxella catarrhalis is a commensal organism of the respiratory tract that has been implicated in the pathogenesis of some COPD exacerbations. It is also a common pathogen found in children with upper respiratory tract infections and in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease during exacerbations. The activity of these bacteria in the onset of otitis and sinusitis is reported, and the seasonal recovery of Moraxella catarrhalis in respiratory infections is significantly increased during the late fall through early spring period.",Yes
Do chromatin features predict genes associated with eQTLs?,Yes,"Chromatin features have been identified to predict genes associated with eQTLs. By integrating large-scale epigenomic profiles with eQTL data, critical chromatin features that predict variant regulatory potential can be identified. These features provide insights into the regulatory mechanisms underlying disease risk and gene expression variation. Chromatin features, such as histone modifications and DNA methylation, play a crucial role in regulating gene expression by modulating the accessibility of DNA to transcription factors and other regulatory proteins. Therefore, the identification of chromatin features associated with eQTLs can help elucidate the functional consequences of genetic variation and provide a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying complex traits and diseases.",No
Is Kummellâs disease an avascular necrosis of the vertebral body?,Yes,"Kummell's disease is a rare spinal disorder characterized by the avascular necrosis of a vertebral body, which occurs in a delayed fashion following minor trauma. The disease is also known as avascular osteonecrosis (AVN) of the vertebral body, leading to a delayed non-healing vertebral compression fracture (VCF) and pseudo-arthrosis. This condition results in non-consolidation of a vertebral fracture caused by ischemia, typically affecting a thoracic vertebra with compression deformity, intravertebral vacuum cleft, and exaggerated kyphosis. Kummell's disease is mainly seen in adults older than 50 years of age and can present with back pain.",No
Are Conserved Nonexonic Elements (CNEEs) important in phylogenomics research?,Yes,"Conserved Nonexonic Elements (CNEEs) are crucial in phylogenomics research due to their evolutionary properties. They are noncoding elements that evolve slower than the neutral rate across a set of species, making them promising markers for phylogenetic analysis. CNEEs yield phylogenetic resolution as high as for UCEs and introns but with fewer gaps, less ambiguity in alignments, and patterns of nucleotide substitution more consistent with the assumptions of commonly used methods of phylogenetic analysis. The quality of CNEE alignments is superior to those of other markers, with fewer gaps and missing species. CNEEs are non-randomly distributed across chromosomes and tend to cluster in the vicinity of genes with regulatory roles in multicellular development and differentiation. They are an abundant feature of vertebrate genomes and constitute the majority of sequences under purifying selection in the human genome. However, their function remains largely unknown and their composition analysis is still scarce. CNEEs display sequence properties that set them apart from other sequences under constraint, and have recently been proposed as useful markers for the reconstruction of the evolutionary history of organisms.",Yes
Can the yeast protein Abf1 act as insulator?,Yes,"The yeast protein Abf1, as a multifunctional protein, plays a crucial role in transcription activation and repression, as well as DNA replication. It binds to specific DNA sequences located in promoter regions of various yeast genes, including the essential gene ded1. Abf1 has been shown to modulate transcription of the tbp-encoding gene, spt15, in vivo. Additionally, the involvement of Abf1 in organizing the chromatin structure of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae ars1 region has been previously postulated. Given its ability to bind to specific DNA sequences and modulate transcription, it is plausible that Abf1 could act as an insulator, preventing inappropriate interactions between enhancers and promoters or between neighboring genes. However, further research is needed to confirm this hypothesis.",Yes
Is there any linear-time and linear-space algorithm for the computation of avoided words in biological sequences?,Yes,"Recent studies have introduced an algorithm for generating minimal absent words in biological sequences, such as DNA data, which operates in approximately linear time. This algorithm identifies a new class of absent words, referred to as minimal absent words, that captures the essential properties of the shortest absent words. Unlike generic absent words, which grow exponentially with the string size, the number of minimal absent words grows at most linearly. This manageable growth rate ensures that the set of minimal absent words remains computationally feasible and potentially more useful for applications requiring a richer variety of absent words. The algorithm's linear-time performance and linear-space complexity contribute to its efficiency in computing avoided words in biological sequences.",Yes
Is a CpG island methylator phenotype involved in ependymomas?,Yes,"Justification: The study has identified aberrant methylation of promoter CpG islands in several tumor-associated genes in ependymomas. Hypermethylation was detected in 8 out of 11 genes studied, and 74% of tumors were hypermethylated in at least one gene. This pattern of widespread promoter methylation is similar to the CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) identified in other cancers, such as glioma and colon carcinoma. Therefore, it can be concluded that a CpG island methylator phenotype is involved in ependymomas.",Yes
Are loop domains preserved upon cohesin loss?,No,"Upon cohesin loss, loop domains are not preserved. Cohesin is a key factor in the formation and maintenance of chromatin loops. Its ATPase activity and interaction with NIPBL-MAU2 are essential for loop formation and maintenance. Moreover, cohesin forms chromatin loops via loop extrusion, a process that involves the formation and enlargement of DNA loops. Cohesin also catalyzes the folding of the genome into loops that are anchored by CTCF. The cohesin complex mediates DNA-DNA interactions both between and within chromosomes. Therefore, in the absence of cohesin, the structural integrity of loop domains would be compromised, leading to their disruption.",Yes
Is Loss of function one of the cardinal signs of inflammation?,Yes,"Inflammation, as a response to injury or infection, is characterized by five cardinal signs: heat, redness, swelling, pain, and loss of function. The loss of function, also referred to as limitation of movement, is a crucial aspect of the inflammatory process. This loss of function can be attributed to various factors, including pain, swelling, and tissue damage. In the context of chronic inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, persistent inflammation often leads to joint destruction, deformity, and significant limitation of function, which ultimately results in a deterioration of quality of life. Furthermore, inflammation is linked to adverse symptoms related to the stimulation of nerve fibers, which can lead to pain and further exacerbate the loss of function. Therefore, it can be concluded that loss of function is indeed one of the cardinal signs of inflammation.",Yes
Does the association of PARP1 and CTCF follow a circadian rhythm?,Insufficient,"Information

The context provided does not offer any direct or indirect information regarding the association between PARP1 and CTCF, let alone their potential circadian rhythmicity. Therefore, it is not possible to definitively state whether the association between PARP1 and CTCF follows a circadian rhythm based solely on the given context. Further research and evidence are required to make an accurate determination.",Yes
Does erythromycin increase risk of hypertrophic pyloric stenosis?,Yes,"Erythromycin exposure in newborn infants has been shown to be significantly associated with the development of infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (IHPS) [2.45 (1.12-5.35), p = 0.02]. The use of macrolides, including erythromycin, during breastfeeding has been linked to an increased risk of IHPS in neonates. Furthermore, erythromycin treatment before 2 weeks of age has been found to increase the risk of IHPS up to 10 times. The prominent gastrokinetic properties of erythromycin, which include increasing lower esophageal sphincter pressure and decreasing esophageal contraction velocity, may contribute to this phenomenon. However, the exact mechanism behind the association between erythromycin and IHPS remains unclear.",Yes
Has the proteome of mice hippocampus been analysed?,Yes,"The proteome of the mouse hippocampus has been analyzed using a proteomic approach based on two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) coupled with mass spectrometry [high capacity ion trap (HCT)]. This method has been employed to determine strain-dependent levels of metabolic proteins in hippocampal tissue of four inbred and one outbred mouse strain. Additionally, the temporal changes of the mouse hippocampal synaptic membrane proteome have been analyzed 1 and 4 hours after contextual fear learning, comparing two groups: a fear memory forming ""delayed-shock"" group and a fear memory-deficient ""immediate-shock"" group. Furthermore, a 9,000 gene microarray has been used to examine differences in hippocampal gene expression between two F1 hybrid mouse strains that perform well on the Morris water maze and two inbred strains that perform poorly. These studies highlight the significance of the genetic background for the analysis of metabolic pathways in the hippocampus, as well as the potential of proteomic approaches to provide insight into the molecular underpinnings and genetic determination of strain-dependent neuronal function.",Yes
Was saracatinib being considered as a treatment for Alzheimer's disease in November 2017?,No,"The provided context does not explicitly mention saracatinib as a potential treatment for Alzheimer's disease in November 2017. The context discusses various drugs and treatments, such as aducanumab, rivastigmine, solanezumab, and sembragiline, but it does not include any information about saracatinib being considered for Alzheimer's disease treatment during that specific time. Therefore, based on the given context, it is not possible to confirm that saracatinib was being considered as a treatment for Alzheimer's disease in November 2017.",Yes
Are mouse chromosomes acrocentric?,Yes,"The mouse musculus chromosomes are characterized by the presence of centromeres adjacent to telomeres, a feature that defines acrocentric chromosomes. These chromosomes are predominantly one-armed, with a single long arm and a small, barely visible short arm. This acrocentric nature of mouse chromosomes is further supported by the presence of large blocks of heterochromatin in the vicinity of the centromeres, a characteristic feature of acrocentric chromosomes. The occurrence of Robertsonian translocations, which result in metacentric chromosomes by the fusion of two acrocentric chromosomes, also confirms the acrocentric nature of mouse chromosomes. Therefore, it can be concluded that mouse chromosomes are indeed acrocentric.",Yes
Is overproduction of transthyretin is associated with amyloidosis associated neuropathy?,Yes,"Transthyretin (TTR) is a plasma protein that, under pathological conditions, can misfold and aggregate into amyloid fibrils, leading to the development of various amyloid diseases, including familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy (FAP) and senile systemic amyloidosis (SSA). These diseases are characterized by the extracellular deposition of TTR amyloid fibrils in various organs and tissues, causing progressive impairment of the peripheral nervous system. Wild-type TTR has been shown to significantly contribute to the formation of amyloid fibrils in FAP patients with amyloidogenic TTR mutations, such as Val30Met. Furthermore, the contribution of wild-type TTR to amyloid fibril formation tends to increase in older patients, suggesting that aging may play an important role in the process. Therefore, it can be concluded that overproduction of TTR is associated with amyloidosis-associated neuropathy.",Yes
"SGOT is an abbreviation for an enzyme other wise known as alanine amino transferase, yes or no?",No,"The abbreviation SGOT stands for Serum Glutamic-Oxaloacetic Transaminase, which is an enzyme that catalyzes the transfer of an amino group from L-aspartate to alpha-ketoglutarate, forming oxaloacetate and L-glutamate. This enzyme is also known as Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST) and is not the same as Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT), which is an enzyme that catalyzes the transfer of an amino group from L-alanine to alpha-ketoglutarate, forming pyruvate and L-glutamate. Therefore, the claim that SGOT is an abbreviation for an enzyme otherwise known as alanine amino transferase is false.",Yes
Is patisiran currently (November 2017) in clinical phase II trials?,No,"Based on the provided context, there is no mention of patisiran being in clinical phase II trials. The context discusses various drugs and their clinical development stages, including phase II trials, for different types of cancer and other conditions. However, patisiran is not listed among these drugs, and its clinical development stage is not addressed. Therefore, it cannot be confirmed that patisiran is currently in clinical phase II trials based on the given context.",Yes
Is Solanezumab effective for Alzheimer's Disease?,No,"Solanezumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody targeting soluble amyloid beta peptide, has been evaluated for the treatment of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Despite increasing total cerebrospinal fluid levels of amyloid beta 1-40 and 1-42 in patients with mild to moderate AD dementia, it did not produce meaningful cognitive effects. The phase 3 clinical trials, Expedition 1 and 2, demonstrated that solanezumab was ineffective in subjects with mild-to-moderate AD and had no effect on brain amyloid beta burden. Furthermore, the Expedition3 phase 3 trial also showed no significant effect on cognitive decline in patients with mild AD. Although solanezumab can neutralize soluble amyloid beta peptides, which may represent the more neurotoxic species, its clinical efficacy in improving cognition or functional ability in AD patients remains unproven.",Yes
Are organisms in the genus Morexella associated with sepsis?,Yes,"Organisms in the genus Moraxella have been identified as a rare cause of septic arthritis, a condition characterized by the presence of pathogenic microorganisms in the bloodstream. The association between Moraxella and sepsis is further supported by the observation that gram-negative bacteremia, which includes Moraxella species, has been linked to severe sepsis. Although the exact mechanisms underlying this association are not well understood, the lipopolysaccharide component of the gram-negative bacterial cell wall has been suggested as a key virulence factor that may contribute to the severity of infections involving fungi and gram-negative bacteria. In summary, the available evidence supports the conclusion that organisms in the genus Moraxella are associated with sepsis.",Yes
Are there mammalian promoters with distal enhancer functions?,Yes,"Justification: Mammalian gene regulation is intricately controlled by the interplay between promoters and enhancers. While promoters are proximal regulatory elements that initiate transcription, enhancers are distal elements that can activate gene expression in a tissue-specific manner. Recent studies have uncovered a subset of gene promoters, termed epromoters, which exhibit enhancer activity and regulate distal gene expression. These epromoters are bona fide enhancers, functioning to activate transcription by interacting with target promoters. Furthermore, some enhancers, particularly bidirectional ones, can act as weak promoters, producing overlapping spatio-temporal expression. These findings suggest that the distinction between promoters and enhancers is not absolute, and that certain mammalian promoters can indeed possess distal enhancer functions.",Yes
Is autosomal dominant inheritanced form of Osteogenesis imperfecta caused by mutations in the genes associated with collagen production?,Yes,"Justification: Autosomal dominant Osteogenesis imperfecta is primarily caused by mutations in the genes (col1a1 or col1a2) that encode the chains of type I collagen. These mutations result in either a reduction in the production of normal collagen I or the synthesis of abnormal collagen, leading to bone fragility and increased susceptibility to fractures. The autosomal dominant inheritance pattern is due to the fact that a single mutated allele can contribute a mutant, destructive subunit polypeptide to collagen, disrupting the normal polymeric collagenous structures.",Yes
Is Apremilast effective for Behcetâs syndrome?,Yes,"Apremilast has been shown to be effective for Behcet's syndrome in phase 2 and phase 3 clinical trials. In these trials, patients with Behcet's syndrome and active oral ulcers were randomly assigned to receive either apremilast or placebo. Results demonstrated that apremilast significantly reduced the incidence and severity of oral ulcers compared to placebo. Additionally, apremilast has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of patients with oral ulcers associated with Behcet's disease. However, it is important to note that further studies are necessary to clarify the role of apremilast in the treatment of Behcet's syndrome and to assess its long-term safety and efficacy.",Yes
Are splicing speckles associated with transcription?,Yes,"Splicing speckles are nuclear domains that contain pre-mRNA splicing factors and polyadenylated RNA. Upon transcriptional activation of a gene in vivo, pre-mRNA splicing factors are recruited from these speckles to sites of transcription. The targeting and accumulation of splicing factors in speckles is a result of the cumulative loading of splicing factors to the pre-mRNA, which gives rise to the speckled pattern observed. The speckled localization of pre-mRNA splicing factors is a reflection of the transcriptional and pre-mRNA splicing activities of the cell. In actively transcribing cells, factors involved in pre-mRNA splicing localize in a speckled pattern at the fluorescence microscopic level. The speckled distribution of splicing factors in the nucleus is altered when either transcription or pre-mRNA splicing activities are interrupted, suggesting that the organization of the splicing machinery in the interphase nucleus is a direct reflection of the transcriptional activity of the cell. Therefore, splicing speckles are associated with transcription.",Yes
Does Enzastaurin improve survival of glioblastoma patients?,Inconclusive,"Enzastaurin has demonstrated anti-glioma activity in patients with recurrent high-grade glioma and has shown promise in preclinical studies as a potent inhibitor of protein kinase C-beta, which inhibits angiogenesis and has direct cytotoxic activity against glioma cells. However, its efficacy as a single-agent therapy for glioblastoma patients is not yet established, as it does not appear to have enough single-agent activity to be useful as monotherapy. The primary objective of a phase II study was to evaluate the progression-free survival rate at 6 months in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma without O(6)-methylguanine-DNA-methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter hypermethylation, who were treated with enzastaurin before and concomitantly with radiation therapy, followed by enzastaurin maintenance therapy. While the study reported promising results, the overall survival benefit of enzastaurin in glioblastoma patients remains inconclusive and requires further investigation in larger, controlled clinical trials.",Yes
Is Tofacitinib effective for Ulcerative Colitis?,Yes,"Tofacitinib, a pan-janus kinase inhibitor, has been shown to be efficacious in treating patients with active ulcerative colitis. Its mechanism of action involves the inhibition of a range of T cell-derived cytokines, including IL-5, IL-6, IL-9, IL-13, and IL-17A. Tofacitinib has been approved for the treatment of patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis and has demonstrated dose-dependent efficacy for inducing clinical response and remission in patients with active disease. The drug has also been shown to suppress acute and chronic colitis in animal models, further supporting its potential as a therapeutic agent for the induction and maintenance therapy in ulcerative colitis. However, it should be noted that while tofacitinib has proven efficacious in patients with active ulcerative colitis, it has failed in patients with Crohn's disease.",Yes
Is CREB a key memory protein?,Yes,"Justification: CREB (camp response element-binding protein) is a key memory protein, as it plays a critical role in memory formation. It is a phosphorylation-dependent transcription factor that is essential for long-term memory formation in various species and learning systems. CREB is involved in memory consolidation and is a pivotal mediator of activity-regulated gene transcription that underlies memory formation and allocation. Additionally, CREB is critically involved in many important brain functions, including the formation of long-term memory. The CREB-dependent transcription necessary for long-term memory is driven by interactions with CREB-binding protein (CBP), a multi-domain protein that binds numerous transcription factors potentially affecting the expression of thousands of genes. Furthermore, CREB phosphorylation and signaling play an important role in long-term memory formation. Therefore, CREB is a key memory protein.",Yes
Is cilengitide effective for treatment of glioblastoma?,Yes,"Cilengitide has demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of glioblastoma multiforme, both as a single agent and in combination with standard chemoradiation. It is a selective integrin inhibitor that targets integrins alphavbeta3 and alphavbeta5, which are overexpressed in glioblastoma cells. Cilengitide has shown activity in recurrent adult glioblastoma and has been well tolerated in clinical trials. Preclinical studies have also demonstrated the anti-tumor effects of cilengitide, including its ability to inhibit tumor growth, invasion, and angiogenesis. However, it is important to note that the effects of cilengitide on glioma cell migration and invasiveness are not consistent and further studies are needed to fully understand its mechanism of action.",Yes
Can multiple myeloma patients develop hyperviscosity syndrome?,Yes,"Multiple myeloma patients can indeed develop hyperviscosity syndrome. This condition arises due to the hyperglobulinemia associated with multiple myeloma, which contributes to increased blood viscosity. The presence of monoclonal hypergammaglobulinemia, often seen in multiple myeloma and WaldenstrÃ¶m's macroglobulinemia, can result in hyperviscosity syndrome. The concentration and molecular configuration of the myeloma protein are crucial determinants in the development of this syndrome. It is essential to recognize and manage hyperviscosity syndrome early, as it can lead to multiple organ damage and, in some cases, be lethal. However, it is important to note that symptomatic hyperviscosity is much more common in WaldenstrÃ¶m's macroglobulinemia (10 to 30%) than it is in myeloma (2 to 6%).",Yes
Does the human lncRNA LINC-PINT promote tumorigenesis?,No,"Justification: The human long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) LINC-PINT, also known as long intergenic nonprotein-coding RNA, p53-induced transcript, has been shown to exhibit anti-invasive activity in lung and colon cancer cells. Recent studies have indicated that LINC-PINT functions as a tumor suppressor, exerting important regulatory roles in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) progression by sponging miR-208a-3p/PDCD4. Therefore, it does not promote tumorigenesis but rather plays a role in suppressing tumor growth and progression.",Yes
Is LDB1-mediated enhancer looping dependent on cohesin?,No,"LDB1-mediated enhancer looping is not dependent on cohesin. This is supported by evidence that LDB1 can mediate enhancer-gene interactions through LDB1 self-interaction, and that LDB1 is a critical effector of GATA1-mediated loop formation. Furthermore, Cas9-directed tethering of mutant LDB1 to the Î²-globin promoter forced LCR loop formation in the absence of mediator or cohesin occupancy. Chromatin immunoprecipitation results also indicate that cohesin is almost completely absent from validated and predicted LDB1-regulated erythroid enhancer-gene pairs. These findings suggest that LDB1-mediated enhancer looping can occur independently of cohesin.",Yes
Is there any link between ERCC1-XPF and cohesin?,Yes,"The ERCC1-XPF protein complex and cohesin are both involved in DNA repair and transcription regulation, providing a potential link between the two. ERCC1-XPF is essential for nucleotide excision repair, interstrand crosslink repair, and double-strand break repair, while cohesin is known to facilitate estrogen-dependent gene transcription and modulate the expression of a subset of genes in the estrogen receptor transcription program. The binding of cohesin to euchromatic regions is largely mediated by CTCF or the mediator complex, and genome-wide binding of cohesin in breast cancer cells frequently coincides with the estrogen receptor alpha (ER). The transcriptional function of cohesin is thought to derive from its ability to connect distant regulatory elements with gene promoters. These findings suggest that ERCC1-XPF and cohesin may interact in the context of DNA repair and transcription regulation, although further studies are needed to confirm this hypothesis.",Yes
Does Evolocumab improve cognitive function?,No,"Evolocumab is a medication that has been shown to significantly reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, and no difference was noted between evolocumab 140 mg q2w and evolocumab 420 mg q4w. Evolocumab has been considered as an efficacious, safe and promising therapeutic modality for hypercholesterolemia and is associated with cardiovascular diseases. However, the context does not provide any information on the effects of Evolocumab on cognitive function. Therefore, it cannot be concluded that Evolocumab improves cognitive function based on the given context.",Yes
Can radius fracture cause carpal tunnel syndrome?,Yes,"Justification: A distal radius fracture can indeed contribute to the development of carpal tunnel syndrome. This occurs when post-traumatic edema in the carpal canal generates excessive pressure on the median nerve, potentially leading to loss of median nerve function or the onset of a neuropathic pain syndrome. This complication is observed in approximately 20% of distal radius fractures. Furthermore, a rare case of carpal tunnel syndrome due to a solitary osteochondroma arising from the metaphysis of the distal radius has been reported, further supporting the association between radius fracture and carpal tunnel syndrome.",No
Can Logic Alignment Free (LAF) be used for bacterial genomes classification?,Yes,"Logic Alignment Free (LAF) can indeed be used for the classification of bacterial genomes. This method combines alignment-free techniques and rule-based classification algorithms to assign biological samples to their respective taxa. LAF is effective in identifying the signal of each class, as state-of-the-art methods to adjust the frequency of k-mers have negligible impact on classification performance. Furthermore, LAF is practical for genome-scale data and does not require pre-existing sequence clustering, making it suitable for the needs of bacterial genome and metagenome researchers. The approach has gained popularity in bacterial genomics due to its applicability to large datasets and its independence from additional functional genomics experiments.",Yes
Is Marfan syndrome associated with chordal rupture?,No,"Marfan syndrome is a genetic disorder of the connective tissue that primarily affects the cardiovascular, ocular, and skeletal systems. It is characterized by mutations in the fibrillin-1 gene, which leads to abnormalities in the formation and maintenance of connective tissue. The most serious complication of Marfan syndrome is progressive enlargement of the aortic root, which can lead to aortic dissection, rupture, or aortic regurgitation. Other cardiovascular complications include mitral valve prolapse and cardiac valvular insufficiency. However, there is no evidence to suggest that Marfan syndrome is associated with chordal rupture. Chordal rupture is a condition in which the chordae tendineae, the fibrous cords that connect the papillary muscles to the mitral valve leaflets, rupture or tear. This can lead to mitral regurgitation, which is a backflow of blood from the left ventricle into the left atrium during systole. While mitral regurgitation can be a complication of Marfan syndrome, it is not caused by chordal rupture. Instead, it is typically due to mitral valve prolapse or other structural abnormalities of the mitral valve.",Yes
Can canagliflozin cause euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis?,Yes,"Canagliflozin, a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, has been associated with the development of euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). This phenomenon is characterized by the presence of ketoacidosis without overt hyperglycemia, as observed in the reported cases of patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The mechanism of canagliflozin-associated DKA is thought to be related to its inhibition of SGLT2 in the kidney, which reduces renal reabsorption of glucose and increases its excretion in the urine. This leads to decreased blood glucose levels, independent of insulin activity. However, the reduction in glucose levels can also result in a decrease in insulin secretion, which in turn can lead to an increase in the production of ketone bodies, ultimately resulting in ketoacidosis. This hypothesis is supported by the resolution of ketoacidosis after increasing dextrose and insulin doses. The risk of euglycemic DKA with canagliflozin use should be considered, and patients should be closely monitored for signs of ketoacidosis.",Yes
Is there an association between Klinefelter syndrome and breast cancer?,Yes,"There is a well-documented association between Klinefelter syndrome (KS) and an increased risk of developing breast cancer in men. KS is characterized by the presence of an extra X chromosome, resulting in a 47,XXY karyotype. This genetic abnormality is linked to various malignancies, including male breast cancer and germ cell tumors. The lifetime risk of developing breast cancer in individuals with KS is estimated to be around 3%.

The underlying biological explanation for this association is thought to be related to the abnormal hormonal status in KS. The increased conversion of testosterone to estradiol, particularly during androgen therapy, may contribute to the development of breast cancer in these individuals. Moreover, the sex hormone imbalance present in KS may also play a role in the pathogenesis of this rare neoplasm.

Epidemiological studies have highlighted a higher incidence of morbidity and mortality among individuals with KS, although the relative impact of oncological diseases, including breast cancer, on KS subjects is still uncertain. Nonetheless, the association between KS and breast cancer is well-established, and further research is needed to elucidate the precise mechanisms underlying this relationship.",Yes
"Are the human bombesin receptors, GRPR and NMBR, frequently overexpressed G-protein-coupled-receptors by lung-cancers?",Yes,"The human bombesin receptors, GRPR and NMBR, are indeed frequently overexpressed G-protein-coupled receptors in lung cancers. These receptors belong to the bombesin family and are part of the class of G protein-coupled receptors that are most frequently overexpressed or ectopically expressed by common and important malignancies. The gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) receptor (GRPR), a bombesin family receptor, is overexpressed in many cancers, including lung cancer. Similarly, the neuromedin B (NMBR) receptor is also overexpressed in various cancers, including lung cancer. The overexpression of these receptors in lung cancer presents an attractive target for cancer diagnosis and therapy. Furthermore, the overexpression of GRPR and NMBR in lung cancer affects tumor angiogenesis, and their inhibition increases the cytotoxic potency of tyrosine-kinase inhibitors, reducing lung cancer cellular resistance and survival.",Yes
Is vorinostat effective for glioblastoma?,Yes,", with limitations

Vorinostat, a histone deacetylase inhibitor, has been shown to have potential as a therapeutic target in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Its mechanism of action involves inhibiting cell proliferation and inducing apoptosis in solid tumors, including GBM. Clinical trials have demonstrated that vorinostat monotherapy is well tolerated in patients with recurrent GBM and has modest single-agent activity. However, it is important to note that the optimal combination of vorinostat with other cytotoxic or cytostatic drugs in recurrent GBM is still unknown. Furthermore, while anti-angiogenic therapy, such as bevacizumab, has shown promising activity against recurrent GBM, the overall survival benefit of vorinostat in combination with bevacizumab and other drugs remains a subject of ongoing research. Therefore, while vorinostat has shown some efficacy in the treatment of GBM, further studies are needed to determine its optimal use and long-term benefits.",Yes
Is there any role of Dlx1 and Dlx2 transcription factors in cortical interneurons?,Yes,"Dlx1 and Dlx2 transcription factors play crucial roles in the development, differentiation, and functional longevity of cortical interneurons. Dlx1 is preferentially expressed in a subset of cortical and hippocampal interneurons, and its expression in developing interneurons suppresses two important downstream regulators, leading to a characteristic morphology with less branched dendrites and fewer dendritic spines. Dlx1/2 has a central role in restraining neurite growth of subpallial-derived immature interneurons during their tangential migration to the cortex. Moreover, Dlx1 is required for regulating the functional longevity of cortical and hippocampal interneurons in the adult brain. Dlx1 and Dlx2 coordinate key components of cortical interneuron postnatal development by promoting their excitability, inhibitory output, and survival. The widespread expression of Dlx mRNA and protein in the adult brain suggests that these genes may have additional roles in mature animals.",Yes
Has ATF4 transcription factor been linked to cancer and neoplastic transformation?,Yes,"Activating Transcription Factor 4 (ATF4) has indeed been linked to cancer and neoplastic transformation. ATF4 is a stress-induced transcription factor that promotes cell survival under hypoxic conditions and other stresses of the tumor microenvironment. Its expression has been found to be closely associated with the progression of many cancers, including non-small cell lung cancer. Overexpression of ATF4 in A549 cells significantly promoted cancer cell growth and invasion, and elevated levels of ATF4 were sufficient to suppress the expression of cellular senescence-associated genes, thereby driving oncogenic transformation. The total expression of ATF4 was found to be higher in lung cancer cells compared to normal cells. While the molecular mechanism of ATF4 in cancer progression is not fully understood, its role in promoting oncogenic transformation by suppressing a central pathway of cellular senescence has been established.",Yes
Are patients with Sjogren syndrome at increased risk for lymphoma?,Yes,"Justification: Patients diagnosed with SjÃ¶gren's syndrome have a significantly elevated risk of developing lymphoma, particularly non-Hodgkin's B-cell lymphoma. This autoimmune disorder, characterized by an abnormal immune response, is associated with an increased risk of lymphoproliferative malignancies. In primary SjÃ¶gren's syndrome, the most frequent type of lymphoma is B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma, which occurs in 5-10% of patients. The frequent association of SjÃ¶gren's syndrome with non-Hodgkin's B-cell lymphoma provides an opportunity to study the underlying mechanisms of lymphomagenesis. Patients with SjÃ¶gren's syndrome have an increased risk of developing monoclonal B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, which frequently occur in the salivary glands. Monoclonal immunoglobulin heavy chain gene rearrangements are a relatively common finding in patients with SjÃ¶gren's syndrome and may serve as a useful marker for predicting the progression to, and early detection of, malignant lymphoma.",Yes
Does prolactinoma increase osteoporosis risk?,Yes,"Prolactinoma has been associated with an increased risk of osteoporosis due to the elevated levels of prolactin in the body. Hyperprolactinemia, caused by prolactinoma, has been linked to low bone density and osteoporosis in patients on long-term treatment with prolactin-elevating antipsychotics. The presence of decreased bone mineral content in hyperprolactinemic patients suggests a direct effect of prolactin on bone, which may be another indication for early treatment of prolactin-secreting pituitary tumors. Furthermore, univariate and multivariate regression analysis has indicated that bone loss in prolactinomas is significantly correlated to disease duration and hypogonadism, which are risk factors for bone loss in prolactinoma. Therefore, patients with prolactinoma are at high risk for osteopenia and osteoporosis, which may be followed by an increased risk of fracture.",Yes
"Down's syndrome occurs when an individual has an extra copy or part of a copy of chromosome 21, yes or no?",Yes,"Down's syndrome, also known as Trisomy 21, is a genetic disorder caused by the presence of an extra copy or part of a copy of chromosome 21. This extra genetic material leads to the development of physical and cognitive characteristics that are associated with the syndrome. The presence of an extra copy of chromosome 21 results in a dosage-related overexpression of genes contained within it, leading to the various phenotypes observed in individuals with Down's syndrome. In some cases, only a specific segment of chromosome 21 may be duplicated, resulting in partial trisomy 21 and milder clinical symptoms.",Yes
Is creatinine assessment included in the MELD score?,Yes,"The Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score includes serum creatinine as one of its components. The MELD score was introduced to facilitate the allocation of orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) and incorporates markers of liver function, with serum creatinine having a strong prognostic value in cirrhosis. However, it is important to note that serum creatinine is an inaccurate marker of renal function in patients with decompensated cirrhosis, particularly for estimating the glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Despite this limitation, the MELD score has demonstrated good performance in predicting acute kidney injury (AKI) after OLT, although serum creatinine had no impact on its prediction. The excellent short-term prognostic accuracy of the MELD score was confirmed even when patients with abnormal creatinine serum levels were excluded from the analysis.",Yes
Is celiac disease caused by gliadin-induced transglutaminase-2 (TG2)-dependent events ?,Yes,"Celiac disease is initiated by the ingestion of gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. The disease is characterized by an autoimmune response to tissue transglutaminase 2 (TG2), which catalyzes the deamidation of gluten peptides. This deamidation process enhances the stimulation of T cells, leading to small-bowel mucosal injury and the production of IgA autoantibodies against TG2. The chronic, small intestinal inflammation that defines celiac disease is initiated by a HLA-DQ2 restricted T-cell response to ingested gluten peptides after their in vivo deamidation by TG2. Therefore, celiac disease is indeed caused by gliadin-induced TG2-dependent events.",Yes
"Does wheat belongs to the genus Avena, yes or no?",No,"Wheat, scientifically known as Triticum aestivum, does not belong to the genus Avena. The genus Avena includes species such as oat (Avena sativa), which is a recognized health-food with valuable nutritional, medicinal, and pharmaceutical uses. Phylogenomic analyses based on complete plastome sequences and lsc intermolecular recombination sequences support the monophyly of Avena with two clades in the genus. However, wheat is a distinct crop species that belongs to the genus Triticum, and it is an important crop that requires long day and short night to flower. The relationship between gene expression and responsiveness to aba at the seedling stage has not been well studied in wheat, and its morpho-physiological adaptation and adaptation to drought are largely unknown. Therefore, it is clear that wheat does not belong to the genus Avena.",Yes
Does Uc.160 promote cancer?,Yes,"The -160c/a polymorphism (rs16260) of the E-cadherin gene has been identified as a tumor susceptibility allele for various types of cancers. In European populations, the -160aa homozygote is associated with an increased risk of urothelial cancer, while carriers of the -160a allele are at an increased risk of lung and prostate cancers. Additionally, carriers of the -160a allele with gastric cancer suffer a significantly increased risk compared to their Asian counterparts. A meta-analysis has indicated that the -160a allele of E-cadherin provides a higher risk for the development of prostate and urothelial cancers and a protective role for colorectal cancer in an ethnicity-dependent manner. These findings suggest that the -160a allele of the E-cadherin gene is emerging as a low-penetrance tumor susceptibility allele for the development of gastric, lung, prostate, and urothelial cancers.",Yes
Can doxycycline cause photosensitivity?,Yes,"Doxycycline, a tetracycline antibiotic, has been identified as a photosensitizing agent, capable of inducing phototoxic reactions. The mechanism of this phototoxicity is complex and involves the formation of stable photoproducts. When exposed to UVA radiation, doxycycline can cause a concentration-dependent loss in melanocyte viability and induce melanin biosynthesis. This can result in the development of phototoxic rashes, as observed in a case series of adolescents with acne who developed bilateral phototoxic rashes on their hands while taking doxycycline. It is important to note that the potential for phototoxicity with doxycycline is of particular concern in patients with conditions that predominantly occur during summer, such as erythema migrans (EM), and in travelers to tropical countries who take doxycycline for malaria prophylaxis. Therefore, patients prescribed doxycycline should be counseled about the potential for phototoxicity and the need for appropriate sun protection while taking the medication.",Yes
Are paralog genes co-regulated?,Yes,"Paralog genes are hypothesized to share common regulatory mechanisms, enabling their coordinated expression in accordance with topologically associating domains (TADs). This is supported by findings indicating that paralog gene pairs are enriched for co-localization in the same TAD, share common enhancer elements more often than expected, and have increased contact frequencies over large genomic distances. Furthermore, half of the surveyed paralog pairs were found to be co-clustered in protein complexes and were more conserved and highly expressed than non-co-clustered paralogs. These observations suggest that paralog genes are co-regulated, although the mechanisms of co-regulation remain unclear.",Yes
Is polyadenylation a process that stabilizes a protein by adding a string of Adenosine residues to the end of the molecule?,No,"Polyadenylation is not a process that stabilizes a protein by adding a string of Adenosine residues to the end of the molecule. Instead, it is a post-transcriptional modification that occurs in eukaryotic cells, where a poly(A) tail is added to the 3' end of pre-mRNA molecules. This process is critical for gene expression and regulation, as it plays a central role in cellular RNA function. The poly(A) tail is a homopolymeric stretch of adenosine that is added to the 3' end of mature RNA transcripts, and its length plays an important role in nuclear export, stability, and translational regulation of mRNA. Shortening of the poly(A) tail, known as deadenylation, reduces protein synthesis and initiates destruction of the mRNA. Therefore, polyadenylation is not a process that directly affects protein stability, but rather plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression and mRNA stability.",Yes
Are stress granules membraneous?,No,"Stress granules are not membraneous. They are membrane-less organelles that form in the cytoplasm through phase separation in response to diverse stressors. Stress granules are composed of RNA-binding proteins and RNA, and form dynamic, conserved non-translating RNA-protein assemblies during cellular stress. They are related to pathological aggregates in many neurodegenerative diseases. Stress granules are also referred to as cytoplasmic ribonucleoproteins and are considered one of the main cellular solutions against stress. They contain a stable core structure surrounded by a dynamic shell, with assembly, disassembly, and transitions between the core and shell modulated by numerous protein and RNA remodeling complexes.",Yes
Is the consumption of chocolate associated with an increase in cardiovascular disease?,No,"Evidence from epidemiological studies indicates that chocolate consumption is not associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). In fact, accumulating evidence suggests potential preventive effects of chocolate and cocoa on CVD risk. Chocolate's high levels of stearic acid and antioxidant flavonoids have been hypothesized to reduce the risk of CVD. A meta-analysis of prospective studies found that chocolate intake is associated with decreased risks of coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke, and diabetes. Furthermore, chocolate consumption has been shown to have favorable effects on the cardiovascular system, such as improving endothelial function and blood pressure. However, limited data are available on the association between chocolate consumption and the risk of CHD, and relationships between chocolate eating habits and heart rate variability have not yet been studied.",Yes
Is the gene CDKN2A nevogenic?,No,"The CDKN2A gene has been implicated in various human malignancies, including melanoma and larynx cancer, and has been identified as a crucial tumor suppressor gene. However, there is no evidence in the provided context to suggest that the CDKN2A gene is nevogenic, i.e., involved in the formation of benign tumors or nevi. The gene's role in tumorigenesis is primarily associated with its inactivation leading to uncontrolled cell growth, which is a characteristic of malignant tumors rather than benign nevi. Therefore, based on the given information, it is not accurate to classify CDKN2A as a nevogenic gene.",Yes
Are there ways of joint Bayesian inference of risk variants?,Yes,"Joint Bayesian inference of risk variants is indeed possible and has been explored in recent research. Bayesian hierarchical regression methods, which incorporate prior information on the likelihood of variant causality through weighting of variant effects, have been developed and evaluated for this purpose. These methods allow for the modeling of multiple variables together and offer advantages over conventional model building strategies, including the use of existing biological evidence as modeling priors. Novel prior distributions have also been proposed to facilitate learning the role of each variable site by borrowing evidence across phenotypes and mutations in the same gene. Furthermore, Bayesian approaches have been proposed for genome-wide association studies with family-based designs and have been shown to naturally implement standard transmission disequilibrium test and family-based association test statistics in a Bayesian framework. The use of an informative prior in Bayesian methodologies could potentially borrow the strength of historical information and become more popular for their applications to clinical trials.",Yes
Has intepirdine been evaluated in clinical trials? (November 2017),No,"The context does not provide any information on the evaluation of intepirdine in clinical trials. The review focuses on integrase stand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs) such as raltegravir, elvitegravir, and dolutegravir for the management of HIV-1. The context discusses the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of these INSTIs in clinical trials and their potential impact on future clinical use. There is no mention of intepirdine or its evaluation in clinical trials.",Yes
Is subacute sclerosing panencephalitis caused by the Measles vaccine?,No,"Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) is primarily caused by a mutant form of the measles virus. While there have been reports of an association between SSPE and measles vaccination, the majority of cases are linked to wild measles virus infection. Previous studies have reported that approximately 4-5% of patients with SSPE were given measles vaccination but had no history of natural measles. This suggests that the measles vaccine is not the primary cause of SSPE. Furthermore, the widespread introduction of measles vaccines in the 1970s has led to a significant decrease in the incidence of SSPE. Therefore, it can be concluded that the measles vaccine is not the cause of SSPE.",Yes
Does armodafinil improve fatigue of glioma patients?,No,"In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, armodafinil did not demonstrate a meaningful benefit in reducing cancer-related fatigue in patients with high-grade glioma (HGG) who had moderate-to-severe fatigue. The trial involved adults with HGG who were clinically stable at least 4 weeks after completing radiation therapy. Participants were randomized to receive armodafinil daily (150 mg or 250 mg) or placebo over 8 weeks. Despite the well-tolerated nature of armodafinil in primary brain tumor patients undergoing radiotherapy, the results indicated no significant improvement in fatigue or quality of life in glioma patients. Further studies are needed to determine whether pharmacologic treatment can effectively improve fatigue in glioma patients undergoing radiotherapy.",Yes
Is pregabalin effective for sciatica?,No,"Pregabalin, an anti-convulsant drug, has shown efficacy in treating various neuropathic pain syndromes, including post-operative pain and chronic pain conditions. Its mechanism of action involves inhibiting the release of glutamate in the spinal cord dorsal horn, thereby reducing neuropathic pain symptoms. However, in the context of sciatica, a specific type of neuropathic pain characterized by leg pain associated with lumbar spine conditions, pregabalin has not demonstrated significant effectiveness. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of pregabalin in patients with sciatica found that treatment with pregabalin did not significantly reduce the intensity of leg pain or improve other outcomes compared to placebo over an 8-week period. Therefore, based on available evidence, pregabalin is not considered an effective treatment option for sciatica.",Yes
Can gas vesicles be detected by ultrasound?,Yes,"Justification: Gas vesicles, which are genetically encoded protein nanostructures, have been identified as nanoscale reporters for ultrasound. These structures exhibit non-linear behavior when exposed to ultrasound at incident pressures ranging from 160 kPa to the collapse pressure. This results in the generation of second harmonic amplitudes of -2 to -6 dB below the fundamental in media with varying viscosities. Furthermore, genetic engineering of gas vesicles can yield nanostructures with new mechanical, acoustic, surface, and functional properties, enabling harmonic, multiplexed, and multimodal ultrasound imaging, as well as cell-specific molecular targeting. Therefore, it is scientifically valid to conclude that gas vesicles can indeed be detected by ultrasound.",Yes
Is Citrobacter rodentium pathogenic?,Yes,"Citrobacter rodentium is a pathogenic bacterium, specifically classified as a murine-specific enteric pathogen. It is a gram-negative bacterium that infects epithelial cells in the colon, causing transmissible colonic hyperplasia and colitis in mice. This pathogen belongs to the attaching and effacing family of enteric bacterial pathogens, which also includes both enteropathogenic and enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli. Citrobacter rodentium shares similar virulence strategies with these human pathogens, including the ability to cause attaching and effacing lesions in the colon. It is a highly infectious pathogen that serves as a useful model for studying the pathogenicity of related human pathogens.",Yes
Can CD55 deficiency cause thrombosis?,Yes,"The context suggests that CD55 deficiency can contribute to thrombosis indirectly by compromising the complement regulatory function, leading to overactivation of complement and innate immunity. The deficiency of other protein C system proteins is known to cause thrombotic disease, and since CD55 is a complement regulatory protein, defects in the gene coding for CD55 could potentially be responsible for inherited thrombophilia. However, the direct causation of thrombosis due to CD55 deficiency requires further investigation.",Yes
Are sleep apnea and snoring associated with cardiac arrhythmias?,Yes,".

Justification: The scientific literature supports the association between sleep apnea and cardiac arrhythmias. Various cardiac arrhythmias, such as nocturnal arrhythmias, are reportedly more prevalent among subjects with sleep-disordered breathing. The pathophysiology of these arrhythmias is linked to the autonomic effects of recurrent apnea, intermittent hypoxia, and sympathetic nervous system activity surges. Although the association between sleep apnea and ventricular arrhythmias remains unclear, the treatment of sleep apnea has been shown to resolve bradyarrhythmias. Furthermore, patients with ventricular arrhythmias should be systematically assessed for sleep apnea due to its potential detrimental effects. In summary, the evidence suggests that sleep apnea and snoring are associated with cardiac arrhythmias.",Yes
Are osteoclasts specialized in bone degradation?,Yes,"Osteoclasts are specialized cells that are primarily responsible for bone degradation and resorption. These cells are multinucleated and are generated by differentiation of monocyte/macrophage hematopoietic lineages. Osteoclasts play a critical role in bone remodeling and catabolic bone diseases, such as osteoporosis and rheumatoid arthritis, by degrading bone matrix through the secretion of lytic enzymes. The major function of osteoclasts is to hydrolyze inorganic hydroxyapatite and degrade organic bone matrix, mainly collagen. Osteoclasts are the exclusive cells of bone resorption and are central mediators of both normal bone remodeling and pathologies associated with excessive bone resorption. They maintain the balance of bone metabolism by cooperating with osteoblasts, which are responsible for bone formation. Osteoclasts are therefore a major target of osteoporosis therapeutics aimed at preserving bone.",Yes
Does temsirolimus improve survival of glioblastoma patients?,No,"The context does not provide information regarding the impact of temsirolimus on the survival of glioblastoma patients. The context focuses primarily on the use of temozolomide in combination with radiotherapy as a standard treatment for newly diagnosed glioblastoma, which has been shown to improve overall survival and 2-year survival rates. The context also mentions alternative dosing schedules of temozolomide, dose-intensifying temozolomide, and molecular-targeting therapies as strategies to overcome temozolomide resistance and improve survival. However, there is no mention of temsirolimus in the context, and therefore, it cannot be determined whether temsirolimus improves survival in glioblastoma patients based on the provided information.",Yes
Are there sex differences in the transcriptome of the mouse hippocampus?,Yes,"The transcriptome of the mouse hippocampus exhibits sex differences. While it is known that sex differences in the morphology and function of the hippocampus have been reported in several species, the existence of sexual dimorphism in glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) expression in the rat hippocampus remains unknown. However, studies have revealed significant biological sex differences in ventral hippocampal modulation on anxiety in mice, suggesting the presence of sex-specific transcriptomic differences. Additionally, the significant spectrum of pathways known to predominate in neurons or astrocytes, together with the well-known neuronal and glial markers observed, revealed sex-specific metabolic differences in the hippocampus. Although the underlying molecular mechanisms contributing to such differences are not well understood, the presence of sex differences in the transcriptome of the mouse hippocampus is supported by the available evidence.",Yes
Does MC1R palmitoylation reduce pigmentation?,Yes,"Justification: The context indicates that increasing MC1R palmitoylation reduces its activity level, which in turn alters hair and/or skin pigmentation in humans. As MC1R plays a crucial role in pigmentation synthesis, a decrease in its activity would result in reduced pigmentation. This is further supported by the fact that variant alleles of MC1R reduce the ability of melanocytes to produce the dark pigment eumelanin, and that reduced function in human genetic variants is associated with a red hair phenotype and increased melanoma predisposition. Therefore, it can be concluded that MC1R palmitoylation does reduce pigmentation.",Yes
"A bite from the Lone Star Tick Amblyomma americanum, can cause the victim to become allergic to red meat, yes or no?",Yes,"Recent scientific studies have identified a correlation between bites from the Lone Star Tick, Amblyomma americanum, and the development of an allergy to red meat. This allergy is mediated by the production of IgE antibodies directed against the carbohydrate galactose-Î±-1,3-galactose (Î±-gal), which is present in non-primate mammalian tissues and also in the saliva of the Lone Star Tick. The tick bite can trigger the production of these antibodies, leading to a hypersensitivity reaction upon subsequent consumption of red meat. This phenomenon has been reported worldwide, excluding Antarctica, and is a significant public health concern due to its potential to cause severe anaphylactic reactions.",Yes
Is Rucaparib effective for ovarian cancer?,Yes,"Rucaparib has been increasingly utilized for women with recurrent ovarian cancer both as treatment and maintenance therapy. Its potential as a maintenance monotherapy in ovarian cancers irrespective of genetic mutation has been supported by clinical trials. Rucaparib, a poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor, has demonstrated anticancer activity in recurrent ovarian carcinoma harboring a BRCA mutation or high percentage of genome-wide loss of heterozygosity. Phase II and III trials have documented that rucaparib has single-agent antitumor activity in patients with high-grade ovarian carcinoma, with both BRCA-mutated (germline and somatic) and with homologous recombination deficiency (HRD). Rucaparib has been approved recently for use in women with high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC). In the ARIEL3 trial, rucaparib significantly improved progression-free survival versus placebo regardless of biomarker status when used as maintenance treatment for recurrent ovarian cancer. Ovarian cancer patients with highly malignant tumors and relapses on platinum-based chemotherapy exhibited statistically significant reductions in tumor size with maintenance rucaparib therapy versus placebo. Genetic heterogeneity of the tumor did not have an impact upon rucaparib efficacy in ovarian carcinoma.",Yes
Does verubecestat activate BACE?,No,"Verubecestat does not activate BACE. The context provided discusses Vertebrobasilar Ectasia (VBE) and Virginiae Butanolides (VBs) but does not mention Verubecestat or BACE. BACE (Beta-secretase 1) is an enzyme involved in the production of amyloid beta peptides in Alzheimer's disease. Verubecestat is a BACE inhibitor, which means it reduces the activity of BACE, rather than activating it. Therefore, it can be concluded that Verubecestat does not activate BACE.",Yes
Is Tocilizumab effective for Giant-Cell Arteritis?,Yes,"Tocilizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against the interleukin-6 receptor, has demonstrated efficacy in the induction and maintenance of remission in patients with giant cell arteritis (GCA). A randomized clinical trial involving 11 patients with newly diagnosed or recurrent GCA showed that tocilizumab was effective in treating large vessel vasculitis in a real-life setting. Additionally, a phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial involving patients aged 50 years and older with GCA demonstrated that tocilizumab was a highly effective therapeutic agent for the treatment of GCA. Furthermore, several large well-designed clinical trials and routine clinical practice studies have shown that tocilizumab is an effective and generally well-tolerated biologic for the treatment of adults with GCA, including those with an inadequate response to other treatments. In conclusion, the evidence supports the use of tocilizumab as an effective treatment for GCA.",Yes
Is there a link between nuclear position and DNA repair pathway choice?,Yes,"The results indicate a correlation between nuclear position and DNA repair pathway choice. The findings suggest that the spatial organization of DNA within the nucleus plays a crucial role in regulating DNA repair, particularly in Double-Strand Break (DSB) repair. The study reveals that DNA repair events are not evenly distributed throughout the nucleus, but rather, they are preferentially located in nuclear matrix-associated DNA. This preferential repair of DNA sequences permanently associated with the nuclear matrix is further supported by the results of pulse-chase experiments. The nuclear pore complex (NPC) is identified as a critical site for DNA repair of persistent double-strand breaks, eroded telomeres, and sites of fork collapse at expanded CAG repeats. The balance between tumor suppressors 53BP1 and BRCA1, and the availability of an undamaged template DNA for homology-directed repair, also influence the choice of repair pathway. The study also suggests that features of the chromatin structure or base composition of sequences in the nuclear center may make them more susceptible to damage.",No
Can non ubiquitinated Tomm20 promote mitophagy?,No,"The context does not provide evidence that non-ubiquitinated Tomm20 can promote mitophagy. The text focuses on the role of Tomm20 as a receptor for proteins targeted to the mitochondria and its involvement in tumorigenesis, particularly in colorectal cancer. The context also discusses the function of Tomm20 in protein import and assembly into the mitochondria. However, it does not mention or suggest that non-ubiquitinated Tomm20 plays a role in mitophagy. Therefore, based on the given context, the claim that non-ubiquitinated Tomm20 can promote mitophagy is not supported.",Yes
Does SARM1 deletion cause neurodegeneration?,No,"SARM1 deletion does not cause neurodegeneration. In fact, the provided context suggests that SARM1 plays a crucial role in mediating neuronal cell degeneration through the depletion of the essential metabolite NAD and the induction of energy crisis. However, SARM1 deficiency has been shown to delay axonal degeneration and correct axon outgrowth in mice lacking NMNAT2, independently of NMNAT metabolites. Additionally, SARM1 deficiency preserves cone visual function in surviving photoreceptors, indicating a protective role against neurodegeneration. Therefore, it can be concluded that SARM1 deletion does not cause neurodegeneration, but rather may have a neuroprotective effect.",No
Is DNA polymerase Î¸ involved in DNA repair?,Yes,"DNA polymerase Î¸ is indeed involved in DNA repair. This enzyme plays a crucial role in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) through a pathway known as theta-mediated end-joining (TMEJ). TMEJ is an error-prone DSB repair pathway that involves the use of microhomologies to align the broken DNA ends before they are joined together. DNA polymerase Î¸ is essential for this process, as it locates and pairs microhomologies present in the single-stranded DNA tails, cleaves the extraneous DNA, and extends the nascent 3' end from the microhomology annealing site. In addition to its role in DSB repair, DNA polymerase Î¸ has also been implicated in the repair of apurinic/apyrimidinic sites and DNA interstrand crosslinks.",No
Can nanoparticles be used for afterglow imaging?,Yes,"Nanoparticles have been widely investigated as agents for afterglow imaging, a technique that involves the emission of light long after the cessation of excitation. This property is advantageous for in vivo imaging as it eliminates tissue autofluorescence, enabling ultrasensitive imaging. The use of water-soluble red afterglow imaging agents based on eco-friendly nanomaterials has shown potential in time-gated afterglow bioimaging due to their larger penetration depth and non-durable excitation. Furthermore, afterglow-magnetic nanoparticles offer significant potential for bioimaging applications as they can be manipulated by a magnetic field and emit light after irradiation with an excitation source. However, challenges remain in the development of probes that can be selectively delivered into target sites and switch on afterglow luminescence. Despite these challenges, the successful synthesis, coating, and conjugation of afterglow nanoparticles, such as red afterglow imaging agents consisting of rhodamine B (RhB) and carbon nanodots (CNDs), have been demonstrated. These nanoparticles hold promise for the development of in vivo cancer diagnostic and therapeutic agents.",Yes
Is there any role of interleukin-11 in cardiovascular fibrosis?,Yes,"Interleukin-11 (IL-11) has been identified as a key player in the development of cardiovascular fibrosis. Recent studies have demonstrated its involvement in cardiovascular diseases, including ischemia-reperfusion mediated heart injury and acute myocardial infarction. IL-11 is a cytokine that has been strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of fibrotic diseases, and its levels have been found to be associated with the cardiac prognosis in patients with heart failure. In patients with chronic heart failure, higher plasma IL-11 levels significantly increase the presence of cardiac events and suggest a poor outcome. Furthermore, IL-11 has been shown to have a crucial role in the development of cardiovascular fibrosis. These findings suggest that IL-11 plays a significant role in cardiovascular fibrosis and may serve as a promising biomarker for diagnosis and prognosis in patients with cardiovascular diseases.",Yes
Is there a disease or condition called Exploding Head Syndrome?,Yes,"Exploding Head Syndrome (EHS) is a recognized and documented neurological condition characterized by the perception of abrupt, loud noises or a sense of explosion in the head during sleep-wake or wake-sleep transitions. It is classified as a benign sensory parasomnia, a category of sleep disorders that involve abnormal sensory experiences. EHS is not life-threatening, but it can cause significant distress and fear due to the sudden and unexpected nature of the symptoms. Although the exact prevalence is unknown, studies suggest that EHS is relatively common, particularly among younger individuals. Despite its name, EHS does not involve any actual explosion or physical harm to the head. The underlying cause of EHS remains unclear, and it is likely that multiple factors contribute to its development. Further research is needed to better understand this intriguing condition and develop effective treatment strategies.",Yes
Is Enlimomab effective for stroke treatment?,No,"In a clinical trial evaluating the use of Enlimomab after ischemic stroke, it was found that anti-ICAM therapy with Enlimomab was not an effective treatment for ischemic stroke in the model studied. In fact, the use of Enlimomab may significantly worsen stroke outcome. This conclusion is based on a study of 625 patients with ischemic stroke who were randomized to receive either Enlimomab or placebo within 6 hours of stroke onset. Enlimomab is a murine intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) antibody that reduces leukocyte adhesion and infarct size in experimental stroke studies. However, in this multicenter acute-stroke trial, Enlimomab had a negative outcome. These observations suggest that the use of Enlimomab in acute ischemic stroke may lead to central nervous system-related clinical deterioration. Therefore, it can be concluded that Enlimomab is not an effective treatment for stroke.",Yes
Are AAV vectors considered for the treatment of retinal dystrophies?,Yes,"Adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors have indeed emerged as a promising strategy for the treatment of retinal dystrophies. These vectors have demonstrated success in restoring visual function in certain forms of inherited retinal dystrophies. AAV vectors possess features such as lack of pathogenicity, minimal immunogenicity, and the ability to transduce postmitotic cells, making them ideal for retinal gene therapy. They have shown safety and efficacy in clinical trials for the treatment of retinal degenerations. Furthermore, AAV vectors have been utilized to treat various animal models of retinal disease and have exhibited promise in both preclinical disease models and human clinical trials for retinal degenerative disorders like Leber's congenital amaurosis and choroideremia.",Yes
Does International Citicoline Trial on acUte Stroke trial supports efficacy of citicoline for stroke treatment?,No,"The International Citicoline Trial on Acute Stroke (ICTUS) investigated the safety and efficacy of citicoline in improving outcomes for patients with acute ischemic stroke. The study found that citicoline was safe but ineffective in improving the overall outcome of patients with acute ischemic stroke as compared to placebo. Although some patients with moderate stroke severity and not treated with t-PA showed more benefit from citicoline, the overall results did not support the efficacy of citicoline for stroke treatment. Therefore, based on the ICTUS trial, it cannot be concluded that citicoline is efficacious in the treatment of moderate-to-severe acute ischemic stroke.",Yes
Is human lysyl oxidase-like 2 a glycoprotein?,Yes,"Human lysyl oxidase-like 2 (hLOXL2) is indeed a glycoprotein. Glycoproteins are proteins that contain oligosaccharide chains (glycans) covalently attached to their polypeptide side-chains. The glycosylation of proteins is a common post-translational modification that plays a crucial role in various biological processes. In the case of hLOXL2, the glycosylation sites are predicted to be N-linked, which means the glycans are attached to the amide nitrogen of asparagine residues. One of these glycosylation sites is located near the protein's active site, and at least one more is known to facilitate the protein's secretion. The presence of these glycosylation sites is a characteristic feature of glycoproteins, confirming that hLOXL2 is a glycoprotein.",Yes
Can GDF15 be a biomarker for metformin treatment?,Yes,"Evidence suggests that GDF15 can serve as a biomarker for metformin treatment. The results indicate that metformin use is associated with a 40% rise in GDF15 levels in participants with diabetes, independent of other factors. This elevation in GDF15 levels is linked to metformin-activated enhancers upstream of GDF15, as demonstrated by the location of specific genetic variants in these enhancers. Furthermore, GDF15 is known to be elevated in people receiving metformin treatment, and its bioavailability might contribute to the protective cardiovascular effects of metformin. These findings suggest that GDF15 levels could potentially be used as a biomarker to monitor metformin treatment and its associated biological effects.",Yes
Has rituximab been considered as a treatment for chronic fatigues syndrome? (November 2017),No,"Rituximab has not been explicitly mentioned as a potential treatment for chronic fatigue syndrome in the provided context. The context focuses on the use of rituximab as a therapeutic option for various autoimmune diseases, including relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis, neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder, and rheumatoid arthritis. It also discusses the safety, efficacy, and long-term effects of rituximab in treating these conditions. However, there is no mention of chronic fatigue syndrome as a target for rituximab treatment. Therefore, based on the given context, rituximab has not been considered as a treatment for chronic fatigue syndrome.",Yes
Does oncogene-induced DNA replication stress inhibit genomic instability?,No,"Oncogene-induced DNA replication stress does not inhibit genomic instability, but rather contributes to it. Activated oncogenes can interfere with replication initiation and regulation, leading to replication stress, which is characterized by the presence of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) gaps. This replication stress can cause genomic instability and has been linked to tumorigenesis. The DNA damage response (DDR) is activated in response to this replication stress, serving as an anticancer barrier. However, the mechanisms by which neoplastic cells tolerate oncogene-induced DNA replication stress are poorly understood. Additionally, exogenously supplied nucleosides have been shown to rescue the replication stress and DNA damage, thereby decreasing oncogene-induced transformation. This suggests that both genetic and non-genetic factors can modulate replication stress and affect the probability of neoplastic transformation.",Yes
Is the petrous bone used in ancient DNA sampling?,Yes,"The petrous bone, a dense and compact portion of the temporal bone, has been shown to be a valuable source of DNA in ancient DNA studies. Its high endogenous DNA content and superior DNA preservation make it an advantageous substrate for ancient DNA analysis compared to other skeletal elements. The petrous bone has been successfully utilized in archaeological and forensic contexts, particularly in cases involving infants, toothless individuals, or degraded skeletal remains. The cochlea, a part of the osseous inner ear located inside the petrous pyramid, is currently the most sought-after skeletal element for molecular analyses of ancient humans due to its high amounts of endogenous DNA. The use of petrous bones in ancient DNA analysis has been confirmed to yield better DNA content and quality compared to other skeletal elements, making it a preferred choice for DNA extraction and analysis.",No
Is recursive splicing more common in short introns?,No,"Recursive splicing, as observed in Drosophila and humans, is not more common in short introns. Instead, it has been observed in a small subset of Drosophila melanogaster introns, specifically large introns, where it is used to remove the intron in multiple steps by re-splicing at ratchet points. The process involves the creation of 5' splice sites after splicing. This mechanism allows for the accurate splicing of large introns that might otherwise be challenging to remove in a single step. The evidence suggests that recursive splicing is a mechanism for dealing with large introns, not short ones.",Yes
Is Lysyl oxidase crosslinking collagen?,Yes,"Lysyl oxidase (LOX) plays a crucial role in the crosslinking of collagen, as it initiates the process through the oxidative deamination of specific lysine and hydroxylysine residues. This enzyme, which is copper-dependent and found in the extracellular matrix, catalyzes the formation of a lysine-derived aldehyde. The resulting covalent cross-linkages in collagen are initiated by the deamination of these residues, leading to the stabilization and insolubilization of collagen fibers. Furthermore, LOX family oxidases, including LOX and LOXL1-4, contribute to the crosslinking and stabilization of collagen and elastin, providing these extracellular matrix components with their tensile strength and structural integrity. Therefore, it can be concluded that Lysyl oxidase is indeed involved in crosslinking collagen.",No
Is sternotomy closure done using either a sternal ZipFixâ¢ implant  or conventional steel wire following cardiac surgery?,Yes,"Following cardiac surgery, sternotomy closure can be performed using either a sternal ZipFixâ¢ implant or conventional steel wire. Both methods have been studied and utilized in clinical practice, with the choice of technique often dependent on the surgeon's preference and the patient's specific circumstances. The ZipFixâ¢ system is a cable-tie-based closure technique that has been shown to provide reliable sternal closure. However, a randomized study comparing the ZipFixâ¢ system to standard stainless steel wires found no demonstrable benefit in terms of pain or analgesic requirements. Conventional steel wires, particularly figure-of-8 wires, have been found to be superior to simple interrupted wires in a large cohort of consecutive cardiac operations. Despite the association of stainless steel wires with serious complications, they remain a commonly used sternum closure technique. Alternative methods, such as the use of monofilament absorbable suture material or the sternal talon device, have also been explored.",Yes
Is transcription of eRNA bidirectional?,Yes,"Transcription of enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) is bidirectional. This process occurs from the DNA sequences of enhancer regions, generating non-coding eRNAs that may regulate gene expression. The bidirectional transcription produces eRNAs in both the sense and antisense orientations, with sense eRNAs regulating adjacent mRNAs in cis and in trans. Recent evidence suggests that eRNAs play a role in initiating or activating transcription, possibly by recruiting and/or stabilizing the binding of the general transcription machinery to the proximal promoter of their target genes. The spatiotemporal regulation of eRNA action during early transcriptional elongation has been highlighted in recent studies. Chromatin looping might enable eRNAs to act locally at specific promoters, and numerous known and novel functional RNA structures have been detected within eRNA regions. The chromatin exhibits a double looping manner that facilitates sense-eRNA to promoter and antisense-eRNA to gene-ending region in cis. The bidirectional transcription of eRNAs is a widespread phenomenon that occurs in an activity-dependent manner.",Yes
Is the protein pelota a ribosomal rescue factor?,No,"The protein pelota is not mentioned in the provided context. Therefore, based solely on the information given, it is not possible to determine whether pelota is a ribosomal rescue factor. The context discusses various ribosomal proteins, such as PSRP1, RRF, EF-G, P0, RPS27L, RPP1, and others, but does not mention pelota. Ribosomal rescue factors are proteins that help rescue stalled ribosomes during protein synthesis, such as EIF5A and EFP in archaea and eukaryotes, and EF-P in bacteria. However, without information about pelota's role in ribosomal function, it is not possible to determine whether it is a ribosomal rescue factor.",No
Is CXCL7 a chemokine?,Yes,"CXCL7 is a member of the CXC chemokine family. Chemokines are a family of small cytokines, or signaling proteins secreted by cells, with the ability to induce directed chemotaxis in nearby responsive cells. They are critical to the immune system and play a role in both innate and adaptive immune responses. CXCL7, also known as platelet basic protein, is a potent chemoattractant and activator of neutrophil function. It exerts its function by activating the CXC chemokine receptor 2 (CXCR2) receptor and binding sulfated glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) that regulate receptor activity. Therefore, it can be concluded that CXCL7 is indeed a chemokine.",No
The TRPM2 gene is associated with development of spontaneous thromboembolism?,No,"The TRPM2 gene, a member of the transient receptor potential melastatin-related (TRPM) family of cation channels, has not been directly associated with the development of spontaneous thromboembolism. The gene's primary roles involve calcium ion permeability, apoptotic signaling, visceral nociception, and the development of visceral hypersensitivity. Additionally, it has been linked to inflammatory and neuropathic pain, as well as the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease. However, there is no evidence to suggest that TRPM2 is directly involved in the development of spontaneous thromboembolism. The main genetic polymorphisms known to predispose individuals to venous thromboembolism are Factor V Leiden (FVL) and Prothrombin G20210A mutation (PTM).",Yes
Is a mutation of the  ZIKV's membrane protein prM responsible for the microcephaly in new-born infants?,No,"The claim that a mutation of the Zika virus's (ZIKV) membrane protein prM is responsible for microcephaly in newborn infants is not supported by the available evidence. The pathogenesis of ZIKV-related microcephaly is not well understood, and a detailed molecular understanding of ZIKV-induced pathogenesis is lacking. However, it is known that ZIKV infection during pregnancy is associated with microcephaly, a congenital malformation resulting from neuroinflammation and direct effects of virus replication on the developing central nervous system (CNS). Apoptosis of neural progenitor cells induced by ZIKV infection is believed to be a main reason for ZIKV infection-related microcephaly. Additionally, immune activation after ZIKV infection may play an important role in the pathogenesis of ZIKV-related microcephaly. However, there is no evidence to suggest that a mutation of the ZIKV's membrane protein prM is responsible for this condition.",Yes
Is lumican a secreted protein?,Yes,"Lumican, a member of the small leucine-rich proteoglycan (SLRP) family, is known to be secreted by cells. This is evident from the observation that ht1080 fibrosarcoma cells stably transfected with lumican cDNA (ht1080/lum) secreted moderate levels of lumican. Furthermore, treatment of these cells with bb94, an inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), resulted in the accumulation of lumican in the culture medium. This suggests that lumican is indeed a secreted protein, and its secretion may be regulated by MMPs. The secretion of lumican allows it to function as a component of the extracellular matrix and as a matrikine, regulating multiple cell activities such as cell proliferation, gene expression, and wound healing.",Yes
Is Brucella abortus the organism that causes brucillosis known to cause spontaneous abortions in humans?,Yes,"Brucella abortus, the causative agent of brucellosis, is a facultative intracellular bacterial pathogen that is known to cause spontaneous abortions in domestic animals, particularly cattle. While the primary impact of Brucella abortus infection in humans is undulant fever, there is evidence that brucellosis can induce abortion in humans as well. The cell tropism of Brucella abortus in the placenta is thought to be a key event in infectious abortion, although the molecular mechanism for this is not yet fully understood. However, it is important to note that only a few studies have reported human spontaneous abortions attributable to Brucella species, and further research is needed to fully understand the role of Brucella abortus in human abortion.",Yes
Is p53 a transcription factor?,Yes,"Justification: The tumor suppressor protein p53 is indeed a transcription factor, as it possesses characteristics consistent with this role. It binds to specific DNA sequences and activates transcription from various promoters, acting as a transcriptional regulator. The wild-type p53 protein is a transcriptional activator implicated in the control of cellular growth-related gene expression. Furthermore, p53 has been shown to transcriptionally activate or silence a number of target genes, including its own promoter. The sequence-specific DNA-binding oligomeric protein can activate transcription from promoters bearing p53-binding sites. Additionally, p53 is a nuclear phosphoprotein, and phosphorylation has been proposed to be a means by which the activity of p53 is regulated. These findings support the conclusion that p53 is a transcription factor.",No
Is Cystatin D a biomarker?,No,"Cystatin D, a member of the cystatin superfamily of cysteine protease inhibitors, has not been explicitly mentioned in the provided context as a biomarker. The context discusses the potential of cyclin D1 as a tumor biomarker, its correlation with clinical features and cytokine profiles in SSc patients, and its relevance to preoperative PSA levels, Ki-67 index, and p21cip1 status in prostate cancer. Additionally, the context mentions the prognostic value of Vitamin D in CVD patients and its association with clinical biochemical parameters and mortality risk in chronic diseases. However, no information is provided regarding Cystatin D's role as a biomarker. Therefore, based on the given context, it cannot be concluded that Cystatin D is a biomarker.",Yes
