Can masks reduce corona infections when worn by a large proportion of the population?,Yes,"The scientific evidence suggests that masks are efficacious in limiting the transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The use of masks, if worn properly and consistently, can be an effective nonpharmaceutical intervention in the control of disease spread. Masks are thought to have two modes of effect: they prevent infection with COVID-19 in wearers; and prevent transmission by individuals with subclinical infection. Community-wide mask wearing may contribute to the control of COVID-19 by reducing the amount of emission of infected saliva and respiratory droplets from individuals with subclinical or mild COVID-19. Even with suboptimal efficacy in both prevention of acquisition and transmission of infection, masks could substantially decrease the reproduction number for COVID-19 if widely used.","community-wide mask wearing may contribute to the control of covid-19 by reducing the amount of emission of infected saliva and respiratory droplets from individuals with subclinical or mild covid-19. observational evidence suggests that mask wearing mitigates transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2). the current evidence suggests that masks are efficacious in limiting the transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov2). the purpose of this article is twofold: to provide a brief literature review on the unequivocal scientific evidence that masks reduce community transmission in view of the current pandemic, review mask use in children and to compare and contrast attitudes to mask wearing during the spanish flu and the covid-19 pandemic, and analyse where these attitudes stem from. although the benefit of population-level public facial masking to protect others during the covid-19 pandemic has received a great deal of attention, we discuss for one of the first times the hypothesis that universal masking reduces the ""inoculum"" or dose of the virus for the mask-wearer, leading to more mild and asymptomatic infection manifestations. we assessed the effect of community-wide mask usage to control coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) in hong kong special administrative region (hksar). educating the public on the effectiveness of masks can increase compliance whilst reducing morbidity and mortality. the use of masks during a pandemic can minimize the spread of influenza and its economic impact, yet mask-wearing compliance in adults is often poor. since the emergence of the covid-19 pandemic, the use of face masks by healthy individuals for prevention has been attracting public attention. there is sufficient evidence indicating that masks, if worn properly and consistently, are an effective nonpharmaceutical intervention in the control of disease spread. masks are thought to have two modes of effect: they prevent infection with covid-19 in wearers; and prevent transmission by individuals with subclinical infection. donning masks can play an important role in curbing the spread of sars-cov-2. the recommendation to wear surgical masks to supplement other public health measures did not reduce the sars-cov-2 infection rate among wearers by more than 50% in a community with modest infection rates, some degree of social distancing, and uncommon general mask use. during the covid-19 pandemic, face masks have been employed as a public and personal health control measure against the spread of sars-cov-2. to assess whether recommending surgical mask use outside the home reduces wearers' risk for sars-cov-2 infection in a setting where masks were uncommon and not among recommended public health measures. wearing face masks is one of the essential means to prevent the transmission of certain respiratory diseases such as coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19). in community settings, however, cloth masks may be used to prevent community spread of infections by sick or asymptomatically infected persons, and the public should be educated about their correct use. cloth masks have been used in healthcare and community settings to protect the wearer from respiratory infections. we set out to determine the prevalence of wearing masks to prevent covid-19 and compliance with appropriate measures for the correct use of face masks among the general public in japan where wearing medical masks is a ""cultural"" normality. masks, even with suboptimal efficacy in both prevention of acquisition and transmission of infection, could substantially decrease the reproduction number for covid-19 if widely used. |||",Yes
Does paxlovid protect unvaccinated people with risk factors from severe or even fatal covid 19 disease?,Yes,"The context provided does not contain information on Paxlovid, a medication used to treat COVID-19. Therefore, it is not possible to determine if Paxlovid protects unvaccinated people with risk factors from severe or fatal COVID-19 disease based solely on the given context. It is important to note that vaccines and medications such as Paxlovid are different and serve different purposes in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. Vaccines are used to prevent infection and reduce the severity of symptoms, while medications like Paxlovid are used to treat those who have already contracted the virus. Further information is needed to answer the question accurately.","covid-19 poses an extraordinary threat to global public health and an effective vaccine could provide a key means of overcoming this crisis. vaccines against covid-19 have the potential to protect people before they are exposed to the infective form of the virus. as the coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) pandemic is sweeping across the globe, there is an urgent need to develop effective vaccines as the most powerful strategy to end the pandemic. nowadays, covid-19 also known as novel coronavirus has become a global pandemic by causing severe respiratory tract infections in humans without any definite treatment or vaccine. however, because of the involvement of pathogenic immune processes in many severe presentations of covid-19, eliciting an immune response with a vaccine must strike a delicate balance to achieve viral clearance without also inducing immune-mediated harm. coronavirus (covid-19) is highly infectious agent that causes fatal respiratory illnesses, which is of great global public health concern. the impact of how innate immunity, humoral immunity, and cell-mediated immunity play a role in a harmful versus helpful response is discussed, establishing principles to guide the development and evaluation of a safe but effective covid-19 vaccine. a significant portion of the u.s. population may experience vaccine hesitancy of a new covid-19 vaccine, which poses dangers to both the individual and their community, since exposure to a contagious disease places the person at risk, and individuals are far more likely to spread the disease to others if they do not get vaccinated. these principles can not only guide efforts toward a safe and effective covid-19 vaccine, but also the development of effective vaccines for viral pandemics to come. currently, there is no effective vaccine for tackling this covid19 pandemic where disease countermeasures rely upon preventing or slowing person-to-person transmission. currently, there are no vaccines available for covid-19, and the most effective way to curb its spread is to follow preventive practices. so far, no vaccine or definitive treatment for covid-19 has been invented, and the disease has become a pandemic. globally, the current coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) pandemic is resulting in high fatality rates. respiratory viral infections such as coronavirus (covid-19) will cause a great mortality, especially in people who underly lung diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary and asthma. coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) is a public health emergency of international concern. the need for an effective vaccine to curb this pandemic cannot be overemphasized. when we have a vaccine against covid-19, who should be vaccinated first? till now there are no vaccines and explicit medicines available for the treatment of covid-19 disease, therefore the initiatives like public health and social measures are helpful in limiting the quantity of contaminations and saving lives. people with pre-existing health conditions (pehc) are vulnerable to viral infection while health literacy (hl) and preventive behaviors (pb) have been shown to benefit people during the covid-19 pandemic. these studies of coronaviruses could provide considerable benefits to public health; for instance, by improving and accelerating vaccine development. |||",Yes
Does regular HPV testing in addition to the recommended Pap smear detect more precancerous lesions than just the Pap smear alone?,Yes,"Regular HPV testing in conjunction with the recommended Pap smear has been shown to detect more precancerous lesions than just the Pap smear alone. This is due to the fact that HPV testing is more sensitive for the detection of cervical precancer and cancer than cervical cytology. The addition of high-risk HPV testing to a cervical smear may improve the efficacy of cervical cancer screening programmes, the triage of women with equivocal or borderline pap smears, and the monitoring of women who have been treated for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 (CIN 3). Several randomized controlled studies have shown that screening for cervical cancer using HPV detection can be more effective than cytology alone. Primary HPV-testing has been shown to provide a superior detection of women at risk of cervical (pre)cancer compared to cytology-based screening. Testing for HPV has been shown to increase the sensitivity and negative predictive value for detection of high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN2+), either when used in conjunction with pap cytology testing or alone.","human papillomavirus (hpv) testing is more sensitive for the detection of cervical precancer and cancer than cervical cytology. given the fact that infection with high-risk human papillomavirus (hpv) is causally involved in cervical cancer, addition of high-risk hpv testing to a cervical smear may improve the efficacy of cervical cancer screening programmes, the triage of women with equivocal or borderline pap smears, and the monitoring of women who have been treated for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 (cin 3). hpv screening is recommended for the further evaluation of abnormal pap tests or during follow-up after treating precancerous lesions. combining hpv and pap screening achieves very good risk stratification and sensitive detection of cin3 and cancer (cin3 +), but poorer specificity, and may result in an increased risk of glandular and new lesions during follow-up. several randomised controlled studies have shown that screening for cervical cancer using hpv detection can be more effective than cytology alone. primary hpv-testing has been shown to provide a superior detection of women at risk of cervical (pre)cancer compared to cytology-based screening. to gain further insight into the role of both pap testing and hrhpv testing, the authors examined prior screening results in a population of chinese patients with invasive cervical carcinoma. pap testing is considered to be the best screening tool for cervical cancer but there is currently great interest in the possible application of human papilloma virus (hpv) testing to supplement pap screening for cervical cancer. testing for human papillomavirus (hpv) has been shown to increase the sensitivity and negative predictive value for detection of high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (cin2+), either when used in conjunction with pap cytology testing or alone. testing for high-risk human papillomavirus (hpv) in primary screening for cervical cancer is considered more sensitive, but less specific, in comparison with pap-smear cytology. however, as most high-risk hpv infections are harmless, additional triage testing of hpv-positive women is necessary to identify those with cervical (pre)cancer. for that reason, hpv testing is now becoming an important addition to standard cytological screening of cervical malignancies in women (known as pap test). human papillomavirus (hpv) is recommended as the primary test in cervical cancer screening, with co-testing by cytology for hpv-positive women to identify cervical lesions. we suggest that hpv testing could usefully augment but not replace conventional cytology. given the importance of high-risk hpv (hrhpv) infection in the development of cervical cancer, some studies are now suggesting the use of primary hrhpv testing as a possible screening modality. incorporation of hpv testing into the present pap screening program has the potential of making screening for cervical cancer more effective, and a necessary prelude to assessing this is by determining the prevalence of the high-risk types. human papillomavirus (hpv) testing is proposed in addition to papanicolaou (pap) testing for the detection of cervical neoplasia. hr-hpv dna testing, alone or in combination with pap smear testing, may have a role in primary screening. testing for human papilloma virus (hpv) has been shown to be more sensitive than cervical cytology in detecting both high-grade and low-grade dysplasia. short-time repeat hpv testing increased the specificity for detection of cin2+ lesions from about 94.2% to 97.8%. |||",Yes

Can probiotics lower blood sugar in type 2 diabetes?,Yes,"The available evidence suggests that probiotics can have a beneficial effect on glycemic control in type 2 diabetes. Clinical trials have shown that probiotic supplementation significantly decreased fasting blood glucose and hemoglobin A1c in diabetic patients. The modulation of the gut microbiota by probiotics has been proposed as a potential mechanism for these effects, as type 2 diabetes has been associated with dysbiosis.

"In everyday life, when breathing with an FFP2 mask or ordinary mouth-nose protection, do you get as much oxygen as without a mask?",No,"The provided context discusses various oxygen delivery systems, including face masks and nasal cannulas, and their impact on oxygenation. While the context does not directly address the use of FFP2 masks or ordinary mouth-nose protection, it does provide insight into the general principles of oxygen delivery and mask usage.

     The context suggests that the efficiency of oxygen delivery is dependent on the type of mask used and the flow rate of oxygen. However, it is important to note that the masks discussed in the context are primarily used in medical settings for patients with respiratory insufficiency, and their purpose is to increase the concentration of oxygen delivered to the patient.

     In the context of everyday life, FFP2 masks and ordinary mouth-nose protection are not designed to increase the concentration of oxygen delivered to the wearer. Instead, they are primarily used to prevent the spread of respiratory droplets and protect the wearer from inhaling harmful particles.

     Therefore, when breathing with an FFP2 mask or ordinary mouth-nose protection in everyday life, the wearer should receive as much oxygen as without a mask, as these masks do not significantly impede the wearer's ability to breathe in and exhale air. This is supported by clinical observations that report greater patient acceptance and comfort versus oxygen masks, as well as the fact that FFP2 masks and ordinary mouth-nose protection are widely used in various settings without causing significant respiratory distress in healthy individuals.","using the mouthpiece, the fe'o2 after 2 min was significantly higher than using the face mask (p<0.01) or the modified nasoral system (p<0.01). the maximal fe'o2 with face mask and mouthpiece was significantly greater than with the modified nasoral system (p<0.05 and p<0.01). using the hi-ox80 face mask in a rescue helicopter with standard oxygen flows, it demonstrated 3.24 times longer oxygen availability because of a reduced required oxygen flow and therefore a potential calculated weight reduction. using a flow of 2 l/min or more, a significant difference for the fio(2) and pao(2) in both masks was found (p <or= .05). the time to maximal fe'o2 was significantly shorter using the modified nasoral system than with the face mask or mouthpiece (p<0.001 and p=0.0001). effective oxygenation during acute respiratory insufficiency depends on the inspiratory oxygen fraction (fio(2)) and the oxygen face mask used. feo2 was higher for the nonrebreather mask compared with the bag-valve mask with a simulated mask leak (difference 51%; 95% ci 46% to 55%). efficiency of the new mask is greater; hence, similar flow adjustment produces a significantly higher fio(2). we seek to compare the nonrebreather mask with flush rate oxygen to a bag-valve mask with flush rate oxygen (with and without inspiratory assistance) and determine whether the efficacy of bag-valve mask with flush rate oxygen is compromised by a simulated mask leak. at a low oxygen flow up to 1 l/min, the hi-ox80 mask was not superior to the basic mask (fio(2) at 1 l/min 24% +/- 3% vs. 27% +/- 5% and partial pressure of arterial oxygen [pao(2)] 164 +/- 68 vs. 193 +/- 53 mmhg; ns). feo2 for the nonrebreather mask was noninferior to the bag-valve mask with assistance at flush rate (difference 6%; 95% ci 3% to 10%). we aim to measure the efficacy of supplemental nasal cannula oxygen delivery to conventional bag-valve-mask and nonrebreather face mask preoxygenation both with and without a simulated face mask leak. in nonrebreather face mask scenarios with a mask leak, eto2 was higher for nonrebreather face mask+nasal cannula than nonrebreather face mask (mean 65% versus 48%; difference 17%; 95% ci 13% to 20%). we conclude that fico2 is similar at all flow rates while breathing through hudson mask. clinical observations report greater patient acceptance and comfort versus oxygen masks. in bag-valve-mask scenarios with a mask leak, eto2 was higher for bag-valve-mask+nasal cannula than bag-valve-mask alone (mean 66% versus 41%; difference 25%; 95% ci 21% to 29%). maximization of comfort, by delivering o2 directly via a nasal cannula through the mask, will provide better oxygenation and ultimately treat the patient with lower cpap/bipap pressure. compared with the venturi mask, nhf results in better oxygenation for the same set fio2 after extubation. feo2 for the nonrebreather mask was noninferior to the bag-valve mask at flush rate (difference 5%; 95% ci -1% to 10%). eto2 was higher for nonrebreather face mask+nasal cannula than nonrebreather face mask (mean 67% versus 52%; difference 15%; 95% ci 12% to 18%). |||",Yes
"Can a bioresonance device like ""Bioscan"" or ""Vieva Vital Analyser"" measure mineral and vitamin deficiencies or detect health problems?",No,"The context provided does not explicitly mention the ""Bioscan"" or ""Vieva Vital Analyser"" devices, making it impossible to definitively state whether these specific devices can measure mineral and vitamin deficiencies or detect health problems. However, the context does discuss the development of biosensors for real-time, on-line quantitative analysis of key biochemical parameters, including 25-oh vitamin D, which is an important factor in avoiding skeletal damage and various pathological conditions. The context also mentions the potential use of biosensors in clinical practice and their ability to be configured into simple, rapid, and cost-effective laboratory devices. Therefore, it is plausible that similar devices, such as ""Bioscan"" or ""Vieva Vital Analyser,"" could potentially measure mineral and vitamin deficiencies or detect health problems. However, without specific information about these devices, a definitive answer cannot be provided.","deficiencies in vitamins and minerals (micronutrients) are a critical global health concern, in part due to logistical difficulties in assessing population micronutrient status. the need to monitor certain key biochemical parameters in hospitalized patients is driving the development of biosensors, a new class of medical device for real-time, on-line quantitative analysis. this work has been focused on the development of novel optical (surface plasmon resonance) and electrochemical based biosensors for the determination of 25-oh vitamin d (25ohd) which is an important factor involved in avoiding both skeletal damage and a variety of pathological conditions, and to evaluate their potential use in clinical practice. the latter proposed system fits the requirement of determining vitamin d in a concentration range which is of significance for clinical applications; moreover, since a screen printed electrode has been used, this opens the possibility to miniaturize the sensor and developing a portable and easy-to-automate point-of-care testing device. in health and disease, biomarkers have been used not only for clinical diagnosis purposes but also as tools to assess effectiveness of a nutrition or drug intervention. biosensors can be configured into simple, rapid, and cost-effective laboratory devices that will allow the clinical pathologist to become even more responsive to the primary care physician. when considering nutrition studies, evaluating the appropriate biomarker is a useful tool to assess compliance and incidence of a particular dietary component in the biochemistry of the organism. in nutrition studies, selecting appropriate biomarkers is important to assess compliance, or incidence of a particular dietary component in the biochemistry of the organism, and in the diagnosis and prognosis of nutrition-related diseases. this biochemical index (quios) is clinically useful as a potential adjunct in identifying the presence of biochemical deficiencies known to cause osteopenia and the devastating effects of osteoporosis. this work provides proof of principle for the development of low-cost, minimal-equipment, field-deployable biosensors for nutritional epidemiology applications. in recent years, new biochemical and histological methodologies have been developed for assessing vitamin a nutritional status in humans at subclinical levels of nutriture. biomarkers have been used in health and disease for diagnostic purposes, as tools to assess effectiveness of nutritional or drug intervention, or as risk markers to predict the development of certain diseases. in those instances where measurements on discrete samples do not provide the required information, continuous monitoring with implantable biosensors could provide real-time data on levels of critical endogenous or exogenous substances. a biosensor is a microelectronic device that utilizes a biological molecule (eg, antibody, enzyme, or receptor) as the sensing or signal-transducing element. alternatively, a biomarker may give clues regarding the underlying pathology of the condition and be a useful research or specialist tool. a useful intervention needs to exist for a biomarker to be an effective tool. by hybridizing recent advances in transdermal substance collection with the analytical capabilities of biosensors, devices for continuous noninvasive monitoring at the bedside can be envisioned. different approaches to the determination of vitamin d using affinity based biosensors, are described herein; firstly, an immunosensor based on spr transduction was realized for direct determination of vitamin d, obtaining a lod of 2 μg/ml which unfortunately is too far from the needs in clinical analysis. quantitative measurements of various carnitines in dried blood spot (dbs) have potential use in remote health applications for disease diagnosis and epidemiological surveillance. even more importantly, detection of the biomarker should provide clinical benefits to the patient (i.e., improved survival and/or quality of life). |||",No
Does arthroscopy (joint endoscopy) help with osteoarthritis of the knee joint?,No,"The effectiveness of arthroscopy for the treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee remains a subject of debate. While some studies suggest that arthroscopic treatment regimens can improve function and activity levels in patients with moderate to severe osteoarthritis, others have found limited evidence-based research to support the use of arthroscopy as a treatment method for osteoarthritis of the knee. The benefits of arthroscopy for the treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee are thought to be subjective pain relief, potentially via a placebo effect. However, it is unclear how the procedure achieves this result. Despite the lack of consensus guidelines and randomized control trials, the use of arthroscopy for the treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee has increased over the last decade. However, recent literature suggests that knee arthroscopy in the setting of osteoarthritis is no better than placebo. Therefore, it is not possible to definitively conclude that arthroscopy (joint endoscopy) helps with osteoarthritis of the knee joint.","this arthroscopic treatment regimen can improve function and activity levels in patients with moderate to severe osteoarthritis. these data suggest that the benefits of arthroscopy for the treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee is to provide subjective pain relief, and that the means by which arthroscopy provides this benefit is via a placebo effect. to evaluate the role of arthroscopy in functional and subjective outcomes of patient with moderate to severe osteoarthritis of knee. we found limited evidence-based research to support the use of arthroscopy as a treatment method for osteoarthritis of the knee. comprehensive arthroscopic treatment regime has definite role in treating patients with knee osteoarthritis. many patients report symptomatic relief after undergoing arthroscopy of the knee for osteoarthritis, but it is unclear how the procedure achieves this result. despite the lack of consensus guidelines and randomized control trials, the use of arthroscopy for the treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee has increased over the last decade. the place of knee arthroscopy as a therapeutic option for osteoarthritis (oa) has been the subject of some debate. needle arthroscopy is a potentially valuable rheumatologic tool for the assessment of oa of the knee. recent literature tells us that knee arthroscopy in the setting of osteoarthritis is no better than placebo, but arthroscopy for isolated, nondegenerative meniscus tears is both helpful to patients and cost-effective. we conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of arthroscopy for osteoarthritis of the knee. recent advances in instrumentation and a growing understanding of the pathophysiology of osteoarthritis have led to increased use of arthroscopy for the management of degenerative arthritis of the knee. consider the complications and consequences when recommending arthroscopy to treat the painful osteoarthritic knee without mechanical symptoms, as there is no proven clinical benefit. arthroscopy may be indicated in patients with painful dysfunction of the knee joint following total joint replacement. arthroscopic surgery is a common treatment for knee osteoarthritis (oa), particularly for symptomatic meniscal tear. arthroscopy of the osteoarthritic knee is a common and costly practice with limited and specific indications. arthroscopy for degenerative conditions of the knee is among the most commonly employed orthopedic procedures, but its effectiveness (like the effectiveness of many surgical operations) has never been proven in prospective trials. arthroscopic management of degenerative arthritis is an attractive alternative to osteotomy or total knee arthroplasty if predictable improvement and durable results can be achieved. arthroscopy of the knee joint is regarded as the most objective diagnostic method in intra-articular knee joint lesions. the american academy of orthopedic surgeons guideline on the treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee (2008) recommended against performing arthroscopy with a primary diagnosis of oa of the knee, with the caveat that partial meniscectomy or loose body removal is an option in patients with oa that have primary mechanical signs and symptoms of a torn meniscus and/or loose body. |||",No
Can regular intake of cranberry juice or cranberry extract prevent recurrent cystitis in women?,Yes,"The evidence from two randomized controlled trials involving a total of about 300 young women suggests that daily use of cranberry juice or tablets reduced the relapse rate for acute cystitis.

Can ginkgo extract improve mental performance in dementia patients?,Yes,"The Ginkgo biloba extract (GBE) has been shown to have beneficial effects in improving cognitive function and alleviating symptoms of dementia in multiple clinical trials. The extract, particularly EGb 761, has been found to enhance performance in patients with cognitive impairment, including those with Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia. The chronic administration of Ginkgo has been shown to have memory-enhancing effects in both healthy subjects and patients with dementia. The use of Ginkgo extract in treating dementia is based on positive results from good-quality placebo-controlled studies. The extract is reported to improve symptoms associated with cognitive deficits, such as decreased memory performance, lack of concentration, and decreased alertness. The herbal remedy Ginkgo biloba is promoted as a treatment for memory loss and dementia. However, the pharmacological mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of Ginkgo remain unclear.","previous studies of ginkgo biloba extract (gbe) in patients with various forms of cognitive impairment or dementia have shown promising results. in previous trials of the ginkgo biloba special extract egb 761 improvements in cognitive functioning and behavioural symptoms were found in patients with aging-associated cognitive impairment or dementia. recent reviews showed that ginkgo biloba extract egb 761(1) is effective to enhance performance in patients with cognitive impairment (e.g., dementia). clinical trials report that ginkgo biloba extracts (e.g., egb761) reduce cognitive symptoms in age-associated memory impairment and dementia, including alzheimer disease (ad). neuropsychological effects of chronic administration of ginkgo in healthy and cognitively impaired subjects of any age. extracts of ginkgo biloba are widely used to alleviate or delay the progress of age-related cognitive impairment. although previous studies have demonstrated that ginkgo biloba extract has modest effects in the improvement of memory and cognitive function of the alzheimer's disease patients, the mechanism(s) underlying its beneficial effects remain(s) unclear. multiple trials investigating the efficacy of ginkgo for treating cerebrovascular disease and dementia have been performed, and systematic reviews suggest the herb can improve the symptoms of dementia. extracts of ginkgo biloba are widely used for the treatment of cognitive impairment. extracts from the leaves of ginkgo biloba have been suggested to be useful in the treatment of various symptoms of impaired brain functions in advanced age. ginkgo biloba has been shown to have chronic memory enhancing effects in healthy subjects and patients with dementia. based on compelling experimental and clinical evidence, ginkgo biloba l. exerts a beneficial effect in ameliorating mild to moderate dementia in patients with alzheimer&rsquo;s disease (ad) and other neurological disorders, although the pharmacological mechanisms remain unknown. ginkgo biloba is reported to enhance cognitive function in patients with selected neural disorders. the use of ginkgo extract in either dementias of the alzheimer or multi-infarct type or in the case of cerebral insufficiency, a symptom complex related to age-dependent impairment of cerebral circulation, is based mainly on positive results from good-quality placebo-controlled studies that enrolled approximately 1,200 patients with criteria established by international classification of diseases (9th and 10th revisions, icd-9 and icd-10) or the 3rd revision of the diagnostic and statistical manual (dsm-iii-r) (uncomplicated dementia). ginkgo biloba is a plant extract used to alleviate symptoms associated with cognitive deficits, e.g., decreased memory performance, lack of concentration, decreased alertness, tinnitus, and dizziness. the herbal product ginkgo biloba is taken frequently with the intention of improving cognitive health in aging. the herbal remedy ginkgo biloba is promoted as a treatment for a variety of ailments including memory loss and dementia, poor concentration and mood, glaucoma, 'cerebral insufficiency' and 'peripheral circulatory disturbances'. we have previously found that 1 week of treatment with ginkgo improved attention, memory and mental flexibility in post-menopausal women, but the evidence for any beneficial effects of longer treatment is less well-established. the current study aimed to examine the acute effects of ginkgo biloba (120 mg) on memory functioning in healthy older volunteers using the cognitive drug research (cdr) battery of memory tests and the rey auditory verbal learning task (avlt). ginkgo leaf is the most used form of supplement for cognitive ailments. |||",Yes
Does covid vaccination reduce the likelihood of getting long-lasting symptoms (long covid) in case of corona infection?,Yes,"Justification: The context does not provide information on the specific impact of COVID-19 vaccination on the likelihood of developing long-lasting symptoms, often referred to as ""long COVID"". While the context discusses the potential benefits of vaccination in attenuating symptom intensity and inducing an effective immune response, it does not address the duration of symptoms post-infection in vaccinated individuals. Therefore, it is not possible to definitively state whether COVID-19 vaccination reduces the likelihood of long-lasting symptoms based on the provided context.","public health risks associated to infection by human coronaviruses remain considerable and vaccination is a key option for preventing the resurgence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (sars-cov). coronaviruses (cov) are viruses widely known to cause severe respiratory distress due to the prominent clinical symptoms presented. vaccination may attenuate symptom intensity after symptom onset. coronaviruses (cov) cause common colds in humans, but are also responsible for the recent severe acute, and middle east, respiratory syndromes (sars and mers, respectively). we hypothesize that recurrent covs exposure may induce an effective antiviral b and t-cell-mediated adaptive immune response, which could also be protective against covid-19. effective vaccines should confer long-term protection against future outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) caused by a novel zoonotic coronavirus (sars-cov) with unknown animal reservoirs. coronaviruses such as sars-cov and middle east respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (mers-cov) cause high case fatality rates and remain major human public health threats, creating a need for effective vaccines. based on the high-homology between the spike protein epitopes of taxonomically-related coronaviruses, we theorize that past/recurrent contact with covs might shield children also against the circulating covid-19 through a possible neutralizing antibody response previously covs-induced. although the severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (sars-cov) epidemic was controlled by nonvaccine measures, coronaviruses remain a major threat to human health. the incidence and clinical impact of coronavirus (cov) infection in elderly persons and those with underlying cardiopulmonary disease over a long duration is not well described. high-dose vaccine augments immune response in cardiac patients, suggesting that a high-dose influenza vaccination strategy may further reduce morbidity and mortality. clinical symptoms of coronavirus infections can range from relatively mild (similar to the common cold) to severe (bronchitis, pneumonia, and renal involvement). all individuals, especially children, are exposed to various viruses including human coronavirus (covs) that can generally lead to respiratory infections. the primary hypothesis is that high-dose influenza vaccine will reduce the composite outcome of all-cause mortality and hospitalization from a cardiovascular or pulmonary cause compared with standard-dose influenza vaccine within each enrolling season. the disease caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-ncov) was called covid-19 by the world health organization in february 2020. while coronavirus antigens that induce protective neutralizing antibodies have been identified, coronavirus vaccines present a unique problem in that immunized individuals when infected by virus can develop lung eosinophilic pathology, a problem that is further exacerbated by the formulation of sars-cov vaccines with alum adjuvants. such vaccines present major challenges: coronavirus immunity often wanes rapidly, individuals needing to be protected include the elderly, and vaccines may exacerbate rather than prevent coronavirus lung immunopathology. in patients with high-risk cardiovascular disease, high-dose trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine, compared with standard-dose quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine, did not significantly reduce all-cause mortality or cardiopulmonary hospitalizations. higher influenza vaccine dose has been associated with reduced risk of influenza illness. here, we review these literatures and discuss the neurologic impact of cov while highlighting potential implications of the novel sars-cov-2 in the nervous system. |||",Yes
"Do hormonal contraceptives to swallow (the ""pill"") affect endurance performance in women?",Yes,"The use of oral contraceptives has been shown to influence endurance performance in women, primarily through alterations in lipolytic activity and hemodynamics during exercise. Oral contraceptives may increase lipid mobilization in the postprandial state, but this effect is blunted when lipolytic activity is stimulated by exercise. The use of combined oral contraceptive pills has been shown to increase blood volume, stroke volume, and cardiac output during exercise, which may be advantageous to the physical fitness of female athletes. However, low-dose oral contraceptive usage is associated with a decrease in functional aerobic capacity, which may negatively impact endurance performance. The effects of oral contraceptives on endurance performance are complex and depend on various factors, including the amount and type of hormones in the pill, duration of use, and individual genetic predisposition.","the decrease in vo(2)max that occurs when oral contraceptive is taken may influence elite sporting performance in some women. to examine the effects of a moderate dose, triphasic oral contraceptive on measures of athletic performance in highly trained women athletes. because of their hormonal content, oral contraceptives may alter lipolytic activity under resting or exercise conditions in women. these results indicate that oral contraceptive use attenuates soreness following an exhaustive stepping activity but cannot support a relationship between estrogen ingestion and other indices of exercise-induced muscle damage. the use of combined oral contraceptive pills may be advantageous to the physical fitness of female athletes. the effects of a combined oral contraceptive pill on female hemodynamics during exercise were studied in 14 young, healthy women. oral contraceptives are commonly used by women athletes. the increase in blood volume, stroke volume, and cardiac output during exercise was significantly greater during combined oral contraceptive therapy than when the patients were not taking the pill. these data suggest that oral contraceptive use does not significantly affect muscle strength. low-dose oral contraceptive usage is associated with a decrease in functional aerobic capacity, but it does not impinge on the hemostatic mechanism or lipid-lipoprotein metabolism. to determine the effects of the oral contraceptive pill (ocp) on skeletal health, soft tissue injury, and performance in female athletes. overall, oral contraceptives increased lipid mobilization in the postprandial state, but this effect was blunted when lipolytic activity was stimulated by exercise per se. twelve exercising women were randomly allocated to groups of either oral contraceptive users or non-oral contraceptive users. the present study examined the effects of regularly ingesting estrogen, in the form of oral contraceptives, on postexercise muscle damage following a bench-stepping regimen. a study was undertaken to determine whether low-dose oral contraceptive usage would negate the beneficial effect of exercise on cardiorespiratory fitness, lipid and lipoprotein levels, and coagulation. the effect of hormonal oral contraceptives (ocs) on carbohydrate metabolism depends on the amount of estrogen (ethinyl estradiol or mestranol), type and amount of progestin, formulation of the pill (monophasic, sequential, or triphasic), duration of use, mode of administration (oral v parenteral), and race and genetic predisposition of the user. to examine the effects of oral contraceptive use on maximum force production in young women. overall, the advantages of the pill for sportswomen would appear to outweigh any potential disadvantages. there were no significant changes in the concentration of endogenous oestradiol or progesterone or any measure of muscle strength between pill phases (p<0.05). the pill group did not significantly differ from the eumenorrheic group (p<0.05), despite a significant increase in the concentration of progesterone and oestradiol on day 21 of the menstrual cycle compared with day 2 of the menstrual cycle and pill consumption and withdrawal (p<0.05). |||",Yes
Does the pill affect the muscle strength of women??,No,"The data suggests that oral contraceptive use does not significantly affect muscle strength in women. In a small study, the androgenicity of the progestin in the contraceptive pill had no significant association with maximal strength in female athletes. Furthermore, there were no significant changes in the concentration of endogenous oestradiol or progesterone or any measure of muscle strength between pill phases. A study of 9704 participants aged 65 years or more found no evidence that postmenopausal estrogen use has beneficial effects on muscle strength or neuromuscular function. Therefore, based on the available data, it can be concluded that the pill does not affect the muscle strength of women.","these data suggest that oral contraceptive use does not significantly affect muscle strength. in this small study, the androgenicity of the progestin in the contraceptive pill had no significant association with maximal strength in these female athletes. this study was conducted to examine androgenicity of the progestin in oral contraceptive pills and its effect on maximal leg strength in females. these results indicate that oral contraceptive use attenuates soreness following an exhaustive stepping activity but cannot support a relationship between estrogen ingestion and other indices of exercise-induced muscle damage. the present study examined the effects of regularly ingesting estrogen, in the form of oral contraceptives, on postexercise muscle damage following a bench-stepping regimen. between two sessions, initiation of pill use significantly decreased women's preferences for male facial masculinity but did not influence preferences for same-sex faces. to examine the effects of oral contraceptive use on maximum force production in young women. there were no significant changes in the concentration of endogenous oestradiol or progesterone or any measure of muscle strength between pill phases (p<0.05). therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine whether estrogen use is associated with enhanced muscle composition and, if so, whether this translates into improved strength and physical function. hormonal variations during the menstrual cycle (mc) may influence trainability of strength. millions of women use hormonal contraception and it has been suggested that such use may alter mate preferences. both facial measurements and perceptual judgements demonstrated that partners of women who used the pill during mate choice have less masculine faces than partners of women who did not use hormonal contraception at this time. we found no evidence that postmenopausal estrogen use has beneficial effects on muscle strength or neuromuscular function or that it reduces the risk of falling. several authors have suggested that estrogen may serve to protect skeletal muscle from exercise-induced damage. maximum dynamic and isometric leg strength, maximum isometric strength of the first dorsal interosseus (fdi) muscle, and plasma concentrations of oestradiol and progesterone were measured on days 7 and 14 of pill consumption and day 5 of pill withdrawal. after adjusting for age, medications, medical history, and personal habits, current estrogen users did not differ in a clinically meaningful way from those who had never used estrogen on tests of hip abductor strength (mean difference, 0.15 kg; 95% confidence interval, -0.05 to 0.34 kg), triceps extensor strength (0.005 kg; -0.17 to 0.18 kg), or grip strength (0.30 kg; 0.00 to 0.59 kg). to determine the effect of postmenopausal estrogen use on muscle strength, neuromuscular function, and the risk of falling, we examined 9704 participants aged 65 years or more enrolled in the study of osteoporotic fractures. although the beneficial effects of estrogen use on cardiovascular and cognitive function in postmenopausal women have been recently discredited, controversy remains regarding its usefulness for maintaining skeletal muscle mass or strength. to test whether altered preference during pill use influences actual partner choice, we examined facial characteristics in 170 age-matched male partners of women who reported having either been using or not using the pill when the partnership was formed. the purpose of this pilot study was to determine the influence of oral contraceptives (oc) on electromyography (emg) and mechanomyography (mmg) during isometric (iso) muscle actions of the rectus femoris. |||",No
Can low-level laser therapy reduce wrist osteoarthritis pain?,Yes,"Low-level laser therapy (LLLT) has been shown to offer promising symptomatic relief of osteoarthritic (OA) pain, including in the wrist.

LLLT has been used for the treatment of various rheumatologic, neurologic, and musculoskeletal disorders, including OA. Although the laser therapy dose protocol has not been completely established, LLLT has been developed for non-invasive treatment of joint diseases. LLLT is thought to have an analgesic effect and may cause potential beneficial effects. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that LLLT can reduce wrist OA pain.","low level laser therapy (lllt) offers promising symptomatic relief of osteoarthritic (oa) pain. in this systematic review, we investigate the clinical effectiveness of low-level laser therapy (lllt) on joint pain. the review shows that laser therapy on the joint reduces pain in patients. of the various physical interventions used to relieve the symptoms of osteoarthritis (oa), a common degenerative joint disease causing considerable pain and disability, low power laser therapy has been reported to be extremely successful in russia and eastern europe. low-energy laser therapy has recently been popularized in the treatment of various rheumatologic, neurologic, and musculoskeletal disorders such as osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, fibromyalgia, carpal tunnel syndrome, rotator cuff tendinitis, and chronic back pain syndromes. although some studies show that low level laser therapy (lllt) has the ability to modulate inflammatory processes and relieve acute pain condition, the laser therapy dose protocol has not been yet completely established. low level laser therapy (lllt) has been developed for non-invasive treatment of joint diseases. low-power laser therapy has been used for the non-surgical treatment of mild to moderate carpal tunnel syndrome, although its efficacy has been a long-standing controversy. the aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of 904-nm low-level laser therapy (lllt) in the management of lateral epicondylitis. low-level laser therapy (lllt) treatment for pain caused by temporomandibular joint disorders (tmd) was investigated in a controlled study comparing applied energy density, subgroups of tmd, and duration of disorders. the aim of this study was to assess the effects of laser irradiation on osteoarthritic (oa) synovial protein expression. a single diode laser irradiation of the synovial samples of patients with osteoarthritis can statistically significantly alter the expression of some proteins in vitro. the objective of this study is to investigate the effect of low-power gallium-arsenide laser treatment on the patients with shoulder pain. evidence strongly supports that low-level laser therapy (lllt) is an effective physical modality for the treatment of pain associated with myofascial trigger points (mtrp). although recent clinical studies have shown that laser therapy acts as an anti-inflammatory effector in the treatment of some diseases, little is known about the mechanism by which it acts in rheumatoid arthritis (ra) patients. low-level laser therapy (lllt) is thought to have an analgesic effect as well as a biomodulatory effect on microcirculation. laser therapy may cause potential beneficial effects. here, we report the measurement of the effective optical power of low-power laser therapy for carpal tunnel syndrome. the purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of low-level laser on patients with lbp. low power laser has been proved as a pain reducing modality, but there is a lack of studies comparing it with other treatments and also among the iranian race and society. |||",No

"Does taking polyunsaturated fatty acids, such as omega-3 and omega-6, reduce ADHD symptoms in children?",Yes,"The context suggests that supplementation with omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), specifically eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), may have beneficial effects on behavioral symptoms and cognitive impairments in children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Studies have reported abnormal plasma fatty acid profiles in children with ADHD, and suboptimal omega-3 PUFA levels may contribute to ADHD and related developmental problems. Supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids has been shown to increase EPA and DHA concentrations in erythrocyte membranes and improve working memory function in children with ADHD. Additionally, omega-3 PUFAs may enhance the effects of methylphenidate (MPH), a commonly prescribed medication for ADHD. However, it is currently unclear whether lower long-chain PUFAs are related to ADHD pathology or to associated behaviors. Further research is needed to confirm these findings and determine the optimal dosage and duration of omega-3 PUFA supplementation for children with ADHD.","to determine whether supplementation with the long-chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids eicosapentaenoic (epa) and docosahexaenoic acid (dha) affects behavioral symptoms and cognitive impairments in children 6-12 years of age diagnosed with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (adhd). to investigate effects of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 pufa) docosahexaenoic acid (dha) and eicosapentaenoic acid (epa) on attention, literacy, and behavior in children with adhd. cognitive effects of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (ω-3 pufas) might make them helpful in attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (adhd). a number of research studies have reported abnormal plasma fatty acid profiles in children with adhd along with some benefit of n-3 to symptoms of adhd. suboptimal omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (n-3 pufa) levels may contribute to attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (adhd) and related developmental problems. low blood omega-3 lc-pufa have been reported in children with adhd and related behavior/learning difficulties, as have benefits from dietary supplementation. we aimed to investigate the serum fatty acid profile, attention scores and the tolerability in a group of adhd children after receiving methylphenidate (mph) and ω-3 pufas for 1 month. supplementation with the omega-3 fatty acid mix increased epa and dha concentrations in erythrocyte membranes and improved working memory function, but had no effect on other cognitive measures and parent- and teacher-rated behavior in the study population. in children, omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (pufas) may elicit a suite of health benefits including enhancement of cognitive development. increasing erythrocyte dha and epa via dietary supplementation may improve behavior, attention, and literacy in children with adhd. therefore, our study suggests that ω-3 pufas may represent a feasible and a safe adjuvant therapy in children with adhd and might enhance the effects of mph. associations between n-3 and omega-6 (n-6) pufa levels in red blood cells (erythrocytes) and learning and behaviour were investigated in 75 children aged 7-12 with adhd. the findings unveil for the first time that cu and anti-social traits in adhd are associated with lower omega-3 levels. however, it is currently unclear whether (lower) long chain-polyunsaturated fatty acids (lc-pufas) are related to adhd pathology or to associated behaviours. omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 pufas) are known to critically influence brain development and functions. findings from epidemiological and observational studies have indicated that diets high in omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (pufas) such as docosahexaenoic acid (dha) and eicosapentaenoic acid (epa) may reduce the risk of cognitive decline and alzheimer's disease (ad). these findings require confirmation, but suggest that the benefits from dietary supplementation with omega-3 lc-pufa found for adhd, dyspraxia, dyslexia, and related conditions might extend to the general school population. omega-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (lc-pufa), especially dha (docosahexaenonic acid) are essential for brain development and physical health. a combination of mph (1 mg/kg/day) and eicosapentaenoic (epa, 70 mg/day) + docosahexaenoic acids (dha, 250 mg/day) was administered to 40 adhd children (7-15 years). callous-unemotional (cu) traits were found to be significantly negatively related to both eicosapentaenoic acid (epa), and total omega-3 in the adhd group. |||",No
Does taking probiotics shorten the duration of acute infectious diarrhea?,Yes,"The evidence suggests that probiotics can reduce the duration of acute infectious diarrhea.

Can zinc mitigate the progression of Covid-19?,No,"The context suggests that there is a potential link between zinc and the severity of Covid-19. Zinc is a trace element with immunoregulatory and antiviral properties, and it has been observed that Covid-19 patients with zinc deficiency have significantly lower zinc levels compared to healthy controls. In vitro evidence has suggested that zinc sulphate may be efficacious against Covid-19, and clinical trials are ongoing to evaluate the use of zinc alone or in addition to other drugs in the prophylaxis/treatment of Covid-19. However, direct evidence to determine if zinc is effective for either prevention or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 is still pending, and more randomized studies are needed to evaluate the value of adding zinc to other therapies for Covid-19. Therefore, it is not possible to definitively state that zinc can mitigate the progression of Covid-19 based on the current evidence.","currently, indirect evidence suggests zinc may potentially reduce the risk, duration and severity of sars-cov-2 infections, particularly for populations at risk of zinc deficiency including people with chronic disease co-morbidities and older adults. this study provides the first in vivo evidence that zinc sulphate may play a role in therapeutic management for covid-19. zinc is a trace element with potent immunoregulatory and antiviral properties, and is utilized in the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19). several lines of evidence support a link between the essential element zinc and the coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19). the aim of this study was to determine the clinical significance of serum zinc in covid-19 patients and to establish a correlation with disease severity. through several mechanisms zinc may prevent, reduce severity and duration of symptoms. as a result of in vitro evidence suggesting zinc sulphate may be efficacious against covid-19, our hospitals began using zinc sulphate as add-on therapy to hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin.aim. covid-19 patients with zinc deficiency were compared to those with normal zinc levels. thereby, we aim to discuss the rationale for targeting zinc metalloenzymes as a new strategy for the treatment of covid-19. moreover, clinical trials on the use of zinc alone or in addition to other drugs in the prophylaxis/treatment of covid-19 are ongoing. direct evidence to determine if zinc is effective for either prevention or treatment of sars-cov-2 is pending. because most severely ill patients with covid-19 in our hospital showed zinc deficiency, we aimed to examine the relationship between the patient's serum zinc level and severe cases of covid-19. more randomized studies are needed to evaluate the value of adding zinc to other therapies for covid 19. results of this study show that zinc can prevent some of the toxic effects of nickel and that the mechanism of this action does not appear to involve either metallothionein or alterations in the pharmacokinetics of nickel. covid-19 patients (n = 47) showed significantly lower zinc levels when compared to healthy controls (n = 45): median 74.5 (interquartile range 53.4-94.6) μg/dl vs 105.8 (interquartile range 95.65-120.90) μg/dl (p < 0.001). zinc pretreatment is known to ameliorate the acute and chronic effects of the toxic heavy metal, cadmium. zinc pretreatment significantly increased the 14-day survival of nickel-related rats. however, we do not know the clinical significance of serum zinc levels in covid-19 patients. this was a prospective study of fasting zinc levels in covid-19 patients at the time of hospitalization. the study data clearly show that a significant number of covid-19 patients were zinc deficient. |||",No
Do herbal remedies with nasturtium and horseradish (Kren) prevent recurrent cystitis?,Yes,"The context suggests that herbal remedies containing nasturtium and horseradish can be used preventatively to aid in the treatment of urinary tract infections (UTIs).

Does regular exercise reduce the severity and duration of colds and other respiratory infections?,Yes,"Regular, moderate-intensity exercise has been shown to have a positive impact on the prevention, severity, and duration of acute respiratory infections, including the common cold. Studies have demonstrated that regular moderate exercise can enhance immune function and reduce the incidence of infections compared to a sedentary lifestyle. This is likely due to the anti-inflammatory effects and improved immune effector functions associated with regular exercise. However, it is important to note that very prolonged bouts of exercise and periods of intensified training may increase infection risk. Therefore, maintaining a consistent, moderate-to-vigorous-intensity exercise routine is recommended for optimal health benefits and disease protection.","there were some studies reporting that regular, moderate-intensity exercise increases immunity and prevents the common cold. in this meta-analysis, regular, moderate-intensity exercise may have an effect on the prevention of the common cold. exercise has been shown to improve health generally and may be effective in reducing the occurrence, severity and duration of acute respiratory infections. regular moderate exercise is associated with a reduced incidence of infection compared with a completely sedentary state. regular moderate exercise has been suggested to exert anti-inflammatory effects and improve immune effector functions, resulting in reduced disease incidence and viral infection susceptibility. our study showed that regular exercise resulted in a higher sickness severity score and bacterial (p. aeruginosa) loads in the lungs. while intense and exhaustive exercise is considered an important immunosuppressor agent and increases the incidence of upper respiratory tract infections (urti), moderate regular exercise has been associated with significant disease protection and is a complementary treatment of many chronic diseases. regular, moderate exercise enhances immune function and attenuates immune disturbances associated with acute exercise (ie, a single bout of vigorous exercise). consistent, moderate-to-vigorous-intensity exercise has been associated with a lower risk of upper respiratory tract infection (uri). epidemiologic data suggest that vigorous exercise may temporarily reduce resistance to viral infection. we conducted a meta-analysis to determine the effects of exercise on prevention of the common cold. regular moderate exercise reduces the risk of infection compared with a sedentary lifestyle, but very prolonged bouts of exercise and periods of intensified training are associated with increased infection risk. the effect of exercise on the prevention of the common cold had a relative risk (rr) of 0.73 (95% confidence interval [ci], 0.56 to 0.95; i(2) = 7%). generally however, your patients can safely exercise with colds-and may even feel better-if some commonsense rules are followed. moderate exercise may reduce the risk of upper respiratory tract infections, but intense training can increase that risk. although regular moderate exercise has many health benefits, healthy mice showed increased bacterial (p. aeruginosa) load and symptoms, after regular voluntary exercise, with perseverance of the phagocytic capacity of monocytes and neutrophils. conclusion: recreational winter exercise at moderately cold temperatures reduces allergic airway inflammation measured as feno, nasal eosinophilic cell count and induces sustainable improvements in allergic symptoms. contrary to previous suggestions, moderate physical activity is not associated with lower risk of common cold in middle-aged male smokers. to evaluate the effectiveness of exercise for altering the occurrence, severity or duration of acute respiratory infections. we evaluated whether physical activity at work, or at leisure, is associated with the risk of the common cold, and whether the antioxidants vitamin e and beta-carotene affect common cold risk in physically active people. |||",Yes
Can regular exercise prevent you from getting a cold or other respiratory infections???,Yes,"Regular, moderate-intensity exercise has been shown to have a positive effect on the prevention of the common cold and other respiratory infections.

Regular moderate exercise has been associated with a reduced risk of upper respiratory tract infections, while unusually heavy acute or chronic exercise may increase the risk. However, it is important to note that intense exercise may reduce immunity and increase the risk of infection, particularly in athletes who already have a cold.

"Can filtering out blue light using blue filter glasses or night mode settings on smartphone, tablet or laptop screens have a beneficial effect on sleep?",Yes,"Justification: The evidence suggests that exposure to blue light, particularly from electronic devices, can negatively impact sleep by suppressing melatonin and causing neurophysiologic arousal. The use of blue-light filtering spectacle lenses or night mode settings on electronic devices has been shown to improve sleep quality in individuals with insomnia and delayed sleep phase disorder. These interventions can partially filter high-energy short-wavelength light without substantially degrading visual performance. Furthermore, wearing blue-blocking glasses in the evening has been associated with improved sleep and mood in patients with major depressive disorder. Therefore, it can be concluded that filtering out blue light using blue filter glasses or night mode settings on smartphone, tablet, or laptop screens can have a beneficial effect on sleep.","to evaluate the optical performance of blue-light filtering spectacle lenses and investigate whether a reduction in blue light transmission affects visual performance and sleep quality. because the timing and quantity of light and darkness both affect sleep, evening use of amber lenses to block blue light might affect sleep quality. this study aimed to test whether blocking nocturnal blue light improves neuropsychological function in individuals with insomnia symptoms. our results could therefore suggest that exposure to bright light during the day - as in the present study - may help combat sleep disturbances associated with the evening use of electronic devices emitting blue light. we aimed to determine if wearing amber-tinted blue light-blocking lenses before bedtime improves sleep in individuals with insomnia. we investigated the effect of blue light-blocking glasses in subjects with delayed sleep phase disorder (dspd). blue-light filtering spectacle lenses can partially filter high-energy short-wavelength light without substantially degrading visual performance and sleep quality. our data suggest that exposure to blue-enriched polychromatic light at relatively low room light levels impacts upon homeostatic sleep regulation, as indexed by reduction in frontal slow wave activity during the first non-rapid eye movement episode. the use of blue light-emitting devices (smartphones, tablets, and laptops) at bedtime has negative effects on sleep due to light stimulation and/or problematic excessive use. we investigated whether exposure to blue light during daytime could be an efficient countermeasure to limit sleep restriction's impact on relevant behavioral (stress, sleepiness, sustained attention, and memory performance) and physiological (saliva cortisol, testosterone, and alpha-amylase) markers. altogether, these findings lead us to this conclusion that blocking the short-wavelength component of the light emitted by smartphones' screens improves human sleep. exposure to blue-wavelength light in particular from these devices may affect sleep by suppressing melatonin and causing neurophysiologic arousal. therefore, we tested the hypothesis that cutting the blue portion of the light spectrum with orange lens glasses (blue blockers) would prevent the light-induced melatonin suppression, a test broadly used as an indirect assessment of the circadian clock sensitivity. evidence points to the role of nocturnal light exposure in disrupted sleep patterns, particularly blue light emitted through smartphones and computers used before bedtime. among the 22 participants who were each admitted twice, use of blue light smartphones was associated with significantly decreased sleepiness (cohen's d = 0.49, z = 43.50, p = 0.04) and confusion-bewilderment (cohen's d = 0.53, z = 39.00, p = 0.02), and increased commission error (cohen's d = -0.59, t = -2.64, p = 0.02). using a randomized, placebo-controlled crossover design, we demonstrated improvement in processing speed and working memory with a nocturnal blue light blocking intervention among individuals with insomnia symptoms. the use of electronic devices emitting blue light during evening hours has been associated with sleep disturbances in humans, possibly due to the blue light-mediated suppression of the sleep-promoting hormone melatonin. we hypothesized that wearing blue-blocking (bb) glasses in the evening may influence circadian rhythm disturbances in patients with major depressive disorder (mdd), resulting in improved sleep and mood. this study suggests that, while blue-enriched light has potential to improve subjective sleepiness in night shift workers, further research is needed in the selection of light properties to maximise the benefits. in this study, we examined the effects of covering the screens of smartphones with different filters (changing the effective wavelength of the light) on sleep delay time in 43 healthy students. |||",No
Can regular intake of vitamin C prevent colds?,No,"The studies conducted on the effect of vitamin C on the common cold have not shown a significant decrease in the incidence of colds with regular supplementation. Although vitamin C has been shown to consistently decrease the duration of cold episodes and the severity of symptoms, it has not been unequivocally shown to affect the incidence of colds. The failure of vitamin C supplementation to reduce the incidence of colds in the general population indicates that routine vitamin C supplementation is not justified. However, vitamin C may be useful for people exposed to brief periods of severe physical exercise.","these studies do not support a considerable decrease in the incidence of the common cold with supplemental vitamin c. however, vitamin c has consistently decreased the duration of cold episodes and the severity of symptoms. regular vitamin c supplementation (> or =1 g/day) has quite consistently reduced the duration of colds, but the size of the benefit has varied greatly. the effect of vitamin c on the common cold has been the subject of several studies. although the role of vitamin c in common cold incidence had been studied extensively, the level of vitamin c intake has not been unequivocally shown to affect the incidence of colds. the severity of colds was also reduced by regular vitamin c administration.seven comparisons examined the effect of therapeutic vitamin c (3249 episodes). the combination of a regular daily supplement of vitamin c with extra dosage at the time of illness has been shown to reduce the disability due to common colds and other winter illness, but we have seen little effect on frequency of infections, sense of (well-being), or levels of serum cholesterol. in children, 1 to 2 g/day vitamin c shortened colds by 18%. nevertheless, given the consistent effect of vitamin c on the duration and severity of colds in the regular supplementation studies, and the low cost and safety, it may be worthwhile for common cold patients to test on an individual basis whether therapeutic vitamin c is beneficial for them. however, in four studies with british male schoolchildren and students a statistically highly significant reduction in common cold incidence was found in groups supplemented with vitamin c (pooled rr 0.70; 95% ci 0.60, 0.81). the effect of vitamin c on preventing common cold in healthy adults has been investigated extensively, but not that of other micronutrients. doses of between four and six grams of vitamin c for the first three days of a cold may reduce its symptoms, but as long as vitamin c intake is adequate, long-term prophylaxis is not indicated. in the present study the six largest vitamin c supplementation (> or = 1 g/d) studies, including over 5000 episodes in all, have been analysed, and it is shown that common cold incidence is not reduced in the vitamin c-supplemented groups compared with the placebo groups (pooled rate ratio (rr) 0.99; 95% ci 0.93, 1.04). nevertheless, in each of the 21 studies, vitamin c reduced the duration of episodes and the severity of the symptoms of the common cold by an average of 23%. the failure of vitamin c supplementation to reduce the incidence of colds in the general population indicates that routine vitamin c supplementation is not justified, yet vitamin c may be useful for people exposed to brief periods of severe physical exercise. these studies have not found any consistent evidence that vitamin c supplementation reduces the incidence of the common cold in the general population. nevertheless, the analysis was continued with the hypothesis that vitamin c intake may affect common cold susceptibility in specific groups of people. thus, these studies with british males indicate that vitamin c intake has physiological effects on susceptibility to common cold infections, although the effect seems quantitatively meaningful only in limited groups of people and is not very large. five trials involving a total of 598 marathon runners, skiers and soldiers on subarctic exercises yielded a pooled rr of 0.48 (95% ci 0.35 to 0.64).thirty-one comparisons examined the effect of regular vitamin c on common cold duration (9745 episodes). a large scale double-blind trial was conducted to test the claim that the intake of one gram of vitamin c per day substantially reduces the frequency and duration of ""colds"". the review found that micronutrients supplementation, except vitamin c, may not prevent cold incidence or reduce symptom severity among healthy adults. |||",No

Placebo-controlled trials have shown that vitamin C supplementation decreases the duration and severity of common cold infections. In children, 1 to 2 g/day of vitamin C shortened colds by 18%. The consistent effect of vitamin C on the duration and severity of colds in regular supplementation studies indicates that it may be worthwhile for common cold patients to test on an individual basis whether therapeutic vitamin C is beneficial for them. The failure of vitamin C supplementation to reduce the incidence of colds in the general population indicates that routine vitamin C supplementation is not justified, yet vitamin C may be useful for people exposed to brief periods of severe physical exercise.","these studies do not support a considerable decrease in the incidence of the common cold with supplemental vitamin c. however, vitamin c has consistently decreased the duration of cold episodes and the severity of symptoms. doses of between four and six grams of vitamin c for the first three days of a cold may reduce its symptoms, but as long as vitamin c intake is adequate, long-term prophylaxis is not indicated. placebo-controlled trials have shown that vitamin c supplementation decreases the duration and severity of common cold infections. the effect of vitamin c on the common cold has been the subject of several studies. the combination of a regular daily supplement of vitamin c with extra dosage at the time of illness has been shown to reduce the disability due to common colds and other winter illness, but we have seen little effect on frequency of infections, sense of (well-being), or levels of serum cholesterol. the severity of colds was also reduced by regular vitamin c administration.seven comparisons examined the effect of therapeutic vitamin c (3249 episodes). in children, 1 to 2 g/day vitamin c shortened colds by 18%. current evidence from published systematic reviews indicate that oral intake of vitamin c may assist with symptoms of acute viral respiratory infections (ari) by reducing fever and chills, relieving chest pain and assist in reducing symptoms of common cold-induced asthma. nevertheless, given the consistent effect of vitamin c on the duration and severity of colds in the regular supplementation studies, and the low cost and safety, it may be worthwhile for common cold patients to test on an individual basis whether therapeutic vitamin c is beneficial for them. nevertheless, in each of the 21 studies, vitamin c reduced the duration of episodes and the severity of the symptoms of the common cold by an average of 23%. the trials analyzed in this work used regular vitamin c supplementation, but it is conceivable that therapeutic supplementation starting early at the onset of the cold episode could produce comparable benefits. given the evidence suggesting that vitamin c alleviates common cold symptoms and the findings of this systematic review, it may be reasonable for asthmatic patients to test vitamin c on an individual basis, if they have exacerbations of asthma caused by respiratory infections. the failure of vitamin c supplementation to reduce the incidence of colds in the general population indicates that routine vitamin c supplementation is not justified, yet vitamin c may be useful for people exposed to brief periods of severe physical exercise. to discover whether oral doses of 0.2 g or more daily of vitamin c reduces the incidence, duration or severity of the common cold when used either as continuous prophylaxis or after the onset of symptoms. asthma exacerbations are often induced by the common cold, which, in turn, can be alleviated by vitamin c. to investigate whether vitamin c administration influences common cold-induced asthma. this study examined the impact of vitamin c on physical activity and respiratory tract infections during the peak of the cold season. vitamin c may also have some effect on the immune system. the role of vitamin c (ascorbic acid) in the prevention and treatment of the common cold has been a subject of controversy for 60 years, but is widely sold and used as both a preventive and therapeutic agent. oral vitamin c may assist with the symptoms of acute respiratory viral infections (ari) and common cold-induced asthma but no studies have been identified justifying oral vitamin c for the prevention or treatment of coronavirus infections including covid-19. administration of a single dose of 1 gram of vitamin c to italian non-asthmatic common cold patients increased the provocative concentration of histamine (pc20) 3.2-fold (95% ci: 2.0 to 5.1), but the vitamin c effect was significantly less when the same participants did not suffer from the common cold. |||",No
Do remedies with ginseng help with erectile dysfunction?,Yes,"The study investigated the effects of tissue-cultured mountain ginseng extract (tmge) on male patients with erectile dysfunction (ED). The results showed that the overall therapeutic efficacies on ED were 60% for the ginseng group, compared to 30% for the placebo and trazodone treated groups. This statistically confirmed the effect of ginseng (p < 0.05). In Asia, ginseng is commonly included in herbals used for the treatment of sexual dysfunction. Korean ginseng and mountain ginseng (Panax ginseng ca meyer) are important traditional herbal plants whose ginsenosides are generally accepted as serving to improve sexual functions, such as penile erection. In the group receiving ginseng, changes in early detumescence and erectile parameters such as penile rigidity and girth, libido and patient satisfactions were significantly higher than that of other groups (p < 0.05). Several reports have promoted the root-derived Korean red ginseng (krg; Panax ginseng) as alternative treatment for ED, and ginsenosides are known to be the principal active ingredients of ginseng. Indeed, there is good evidence that ginsenosides can facilitate penile erection by directly inducing the vasodilatation and relaxation of penile corpus cavernosum. Animal studies lend growing support for the use of ginseng in the treatment of sexual dysfunction and provide increasing evidence for a role of nitric oxide in the mechanism of ginsenoside action.","we investigated the effects of tissue-cultured mountain ginseng extract (tmge) on male patients with erectile dysfunction (ed). the overall therapeutic efficacies on erectile dysfunction were 60% for ginseng group and 30% for placebo and trazodone treated groups, statistically confirming the effect of ginseng (p < 0.05). in asia, ginseng is commonly included in herbals used for the treatment of sexual dysfunction. korean ginseng and mountain ginseng (panax ginseng ca meyer) are important traditional herbal plants whose ginsenosides are generally accepted as serving to improve sexual functions, such as penile erection. however in the group receiving ginseng, changes in early detumescence and erectile parameters such as penile rigidity and girth, libido and patient satisfactions were significantly higher than that of other groups (p < 0.05). in this study, we have evaluated the efficacy and safety of an extract of ginseng berry, which has a ginsenoside profile distinct from other parts of the plant, on sexual function in men with erectile dysfunction. several reports have promoted the root-derived korean red ginseng (krg; panax ginseng) as alternative treatment for erectile dysfunction (ed), and ginsenosides are known to be the principal active ingredients of ginseng. indeed, there is good evidence that ginsenosides can facilitate penile erection by directly inducing the vasodilatation and relaxation of penile corpus cavernosum. to investigate the efficacy in treating erectile dysfunction and to develop a natural drug without complications, the results of ginseng treatments are compared to placebo and other drug. as more informations are available, possible breakthrough in treatment of erectile dysfunction could be arisen from active saponin extracted from red ginseng, bringing hopes to many sufferers of erectile dysfunction. thus, animal studies lend growing support for the use of ginseng in the treatment of sexual dysfunction and provide increasing evidence for a role of nitric oxide in the mechanism of ginsenoside action. ginseng is beneficial for many aspects of human physiology, including sexual function. recent studies in laboratory animals have shown that both asian and american forms of ginseng enhance libido and copulatory performance. recent studies showed that ginseng berries produce more ginsenosides than krg; thus, we investigated the ability of the korean ginseng berry extract gb0710 to relax the penile corpus cavernosum smooth muscle (ccsm) in this study. ginseng has a long history of use as a tonic for restoration of vigor. in recent years, there has been increasing interest in the use of herbs and supplements as an alternative to drugs used for the treatment of erectile dysfunction, in order to enhance sexual performance. this study demonstrates that ginseng activity is mediated through estrogenic components and provides further evidence for ginseng treatment of postmenopausal symptoms. ginseng has been recommended to alleviate the menopausal symptoms, which indicates that components of ginseng very likely contain estrogenic activity. treatment with american ginseng also affects the central nervous system and has been shown to significantly alter the activity of hypothalamic catecholamines involved in the facilitation of copulatory behavior and hormone secretion. ginseng is a popular herb for alleviating menopausal symptoms; however, no conclusive scientific data has shown ginseng as being efficient in such therapies. |||",No
Can capsules or tablets with lactase improve the symptoms of lactose intolerance and make dairy products more tolerable?,Yes,"The administration of lactase supplements, such as capsules or tablets, has been shown to improve lactose digestion in individuals with impaired or absent intestinal lactase activity. This is supported by a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, 5-arm crossover study, which demonstrated that different lactase preparations and freeze-dried yogurt culture can affect gastrointestinal lactose digestion and reduce symptoms of lactose intolerance. Furthermore, microbial-derived beta-galactosidase enzyme preparations have been shown to improve in vivo lactose digestion and tolerance through enhanced gastrointestinal digestion of lactose. Therefore, it can be concluded that capsules or tablets with lactase can improve the symptoms of lactose intolerance and make dairy products more tolerable.","management of lactose intolerance can be achieved through the administration of lactase supplements. the replacement of milk with low-lactose and probiotic-enriched dairy products is an effective strategy of mitigating the symptoms of lactose intolerance. lactose digestion can be improved in subjects with impaired or completely absent intestinal lactase activity by administration of lactase preparations and particularly of acid lactase, which is active in the stomach, or by yogurt containing live lactic acid bacteria. we investigated in a randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, 5-arm crossover study on 24 lactose malabsorbers with variable degrees of lactase deficiency if different lactase preparations and freeze-dried yogurt culture affect gastrointestinal lactose digestion after consuming moderate amounts of lactose (12.5 g) by assessing hydrogen exhalation over 6 h. furthermore, symptoms of lactose intolerance (excess gas production, abdominal pain, diarrhoea or nausea) were assessed using validated questionnaires. lactase and other constituent enzymes of various culturing organisms should contribute to assimilation of lactose by lactose intolerant individuals. lactose intolerance syndrome can be efficiently tackled consuming low lactose products. a gradation of lactase activity in the intolerant population may result in sufficient lactose hydrolysis to obviate symptoms and lead to continued milk consumption. this systematic review summarizes the available evidence on the influence of prebiotics and probiotics on lactase deficiency and li. when lactose-malabsorbing individuals use dairy products decreased lactase activity and the subsequent reduction in hydrolysis of ingested lactose can result in gastrointestinal and gaseous symptoms (lactose intolerance). three different beta-gal preparations, lactogest (soft gel capsule), lactaid (caplet), and dairyease (chewable tablet) and placebo were fed to lactose maldigesters with either 20 g or 50 g of lactose to compare the efficacy of these products and to further establish a dose-response relationship for use. the combined administration of freeze-dried yogurt cultures and acid lactase increases lactose digestion more than either freeze-dried yogurt cultures or acid lactase alone, and more lactose malabsorbers benefited from this effect. microbial-derived beta-galactosidase (beta-gal) enzyme preparations improve in vivo lactose digestion and tolerance through enhanced gastrointestinal digestion of lactose. lactose intolerance resulting in gastrointestinal symptoms is a common health concern. in view of an exponential growth in the understanding of intestinal microfloral host interactions and the expanding therapeutical potential of probiotics, a reassessment of the role of lactose as a potential prebiotic in lactase nonpersistent subjects is required. evidence was insufficient that lactose-reduced solution or milk with a lactose content of 0 to 2 g, compared with greater than 12 g, is effective in reducing symptoms of lactose intolerance. nutritional and therapeutic qualities of fermented dairy products are reviewed. our results demonstrate that it is feasible to develop a low-lactose yogurt to which hn001 has been added for lactose-intolerant persons who wish to strengthen their immune system. although ingestion of high energy milk delayed the gastric emptying of lactose for significantly longer than the ingestion of half-skimmed milk (p < 0.01), it did not lead to significant improvement in symptoms and reflected only a trend toward improved lactose digestion (p = 0.07), as measured by the area under the breath h2 excretion curve. as a result, most research to date has concentrated on ways of improving lactose tolerance to enhance dairy as a source of nutrition. uncontrolled studies of lactose intolerant subjects have shown that symptom severity decreases after chronic lactose consumption. |||",Yes
Does the drug remdesivir prevent COVID-19 deaths?,No,"The context suggests that remdesivir may reduce mortality in hospitalized adults with severe COVID-19 by a small amount, with an absolute risk difference range of -4% to 1%. However, it does not provide evidence that remdesivir prevents COVID-19 deaths entirely. The context also mentions that very recent data from the WHO showed little if any COVID-19 protective effect of remdesivir. Therefore, it is not accurate to claim that remdesivir prevents COVID-19 deaths.","in hospitalized adults with covid-19, remdesivir probably improves recovery and reduces serious adverse events and may reduce mortality and time to clinical improvement. remdesivir is one of the most promising drugs to treat covid-19 based on the following facts: remdesivir has a broad-spectrum antiviral mechanism of action; it demonstrated in vitro activity against sars-cov-2 and in vivo efficacy in animal models against the similar coronavirus mers-cov; its safety profile has been tested in ebola patients and in compassionate use in covid-19 patients. to evaluate the effectiveness and harms of remdesivir for covid-19. currently, the fda has approved remdesivir, an inhibitor of sars-cov-2 replication, to treat covid-19, though very recent data from who showed little if any covid19 protective effect. remdesivir might shorten the time to clinical improvement among hospitalized adults with severe covid-19. remdesivir has been associated with accelerated recovery of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19). english-language, randomized trials of remdesivir treatments for adults with suspected or confirmed covid-19. preliminary clinical trial results suggest that there may be a favourable benefit-risk profile for remdesivir compared with placebo in severe covid-19 infection and further data on benefits would strengthen this evaluation. observational studies report an association between remdesivir treatment and decreased mortality, as well as increased survival. remdesivir is a nucleotide prodrug with in vitro and in vivo efficacy against coronaviruses. this scoping review maps the evidence on the efficacy, effectiveness, and safety of remdesivir for patients with covid-19, up to september 14th , 2020. remdesivir, a broad spectrum anti-viral drug, is now under in vitro and in vivo investigation as a potential agent against sars-cov-2. in adults with severe covid-19, remdesivir compared with placebo probably improves recovery by a large amount (absolute risk difference [ard] range, 7% to 10%) and may result in a small reduction in mortality (ard range, -4% to 1%) and a shorter time to recovery or clinical improvement. remdesivir is one of the repurposed drugs under investigation to treat patients with covid-19. these data support early remdesivir treatment initiation in covid-19 patients to prevent progression to severe pneumonia. remdesivir® an small molecule and nucleic acid analogue, it is used to treat adults and children with laboratory confirmed covid-19, only administrated in hospital settings. covid-19 is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2) and is currently being treated using remdesivir, a nucleoside analog that inhibits the rna-dependent-rna polymerase (rdrp). a systematic benefit-risk assessment was designed and conducted to examine the benefit-risk profile of remdesivir in covid-19 patients compared with standard of care, placebo or other treatments. therapeutic remdesivir treatment initiated early during infection has a clear clinical benefit in sars-cov-2-infected rhesus macaques. remdesivir probably reduces serious adverse events by a moderate amount (ard range, -6% to -8%). |||",No
Does magnetic resonance therapy improve complaints of knee osteoarthritis or herniated discs (e.g. pain)?,No,"The context provided primarily discusses the diagnostic value of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in knee disorders, including osteoarthritis and meniscal injuries. While MRI is a valuable tool for accurately diagnosing soft tissue disorders and augmenting the diagnostic process, the context does not provide evidence that magnetic resonance therapy, which is not the same as MRI, improves complaints of knee osteoarthritis or herniated discs. In fact, the context suggests that the role of MRI in improving patient outcomes is controversial. Therefore, based on the provided context, it cannot be concluded that magnetic resonance therapy improves complaints of knee osteoarthritis or herniated discs.","although magnetic resonance imaging (mri) of the knee is known to be an accurate technique for diagnosing soft tissue disorders of the knee, the value of mri in improving patient outcome is controversial. evidence suggests that magnetic resonance imaging (mri) allows accurate diagnosis of meniscal and ligamentous injuries of the knee. this article focuses on the role of mri in the evaluation of disorders of the knee. we investigated whether radiographic severity and treatment type were associated with improvements in pain after nonoperative treatment of patients with knee oa. due to the recent development of arthroscopic techniques in meniscal surgery and anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, an increasing number of postoperative patients are referred for a magnetic resonance examination of the knee because of recurrent injury. magnetic resonance imaging has been found useful in demonstrating degenerative disc disease, disc herniations, cord impingements and instabilities that are not amenable to diagnosis by myelograms and computed tomography. magnetic resonance imaging and plain radiography of the knee were performed in a group of 154 patients with clinical symptoms of knee osteoarthritis and a group of forty-nine age-matched asymptomatic controls. the study shows that mri of the knee is a valuable tool for augmenting the diagnostic process. recent developments in articular cartilage defect repair and the possible role of magnetic resonance imaging in the follow-up are discussed. mri can delineate meniscal tears, cruciate and collateral ligament injuries, and tendon, capsule and cartilage problems. these data do not support the routine use of magnetic resonance imaging for the evaluation and management of meniscal tears in patients with osteoarthritis of the knee. the purpose of this project was to study the value of mri in a subgroup of patients with knee pain and disability whose diagnosis was uncertain after standard orthopaedic evaluation. meniscal tears are commonly found on mri and increase the risk for radiographic knee osteoarthritis (oa). magnetic resonance imaging (mri) is rapidly replacing other techniques as the study of choice for evaluating knee injuries. while standard roentgenograms provide most of the information needed to assess these disorders, the role of magnetic resonance imaging (mri) is rapidly increasing in the diagnostic evaluation of soft-tissue, ligament, tendon, and osseous abnormalities. this paper presents the results of three hrqol questionnaires (sf-36, rosser and euroqol) used to measure health change in 332 patients referred for mri of the knee. meniscal tears are frequently found during magnetic resonance imaging of osteoarthritic knees. to assess whether the presence of subchondral bone marrow abnormalities (bone marrow edema (bme)) and cartilage defects, determined by magnetic resonance imaging (mri), would explain the difference between painful osteoarthritis of the knee (oak) compared with painless oak or pain without oak. patients with knee pain as a result of osteoarthritis or degenerative meniscal injury may seek treatment through arthroscopic surgery. eswt improves womac and rom better then kin on the affected knee in patients with oa of the knee. |||",No
Are oral zinc supplements effective for treating a cold (chill)?,Yes,"The evidence suggests that oral zinc supplements may be effective for treating a cold. Biochemical evidence and clinical studies have shown that zinc, particularly in the form of zinc gluconate glycine lozenges, can reduce the duration and severity of cold symptoms in adults. When initiated within 24 hours of symptom onset, oral zinc is associated with a shorter duration of the common cold in healthy people. Controlled clinical trials have shown that zinc gluconate glycine lozenges can reduce symptom severity and duration of symptoms in patients with the common cold. However, the use of intranasal zinc is strongly associated with anosmia, or the loss of the sense of smell, in humans. Therefore, oral zinc supplements may be a viable option for treating a cold, but caution should be exercised with intranasal zinc.","this review summarizes the current basic and clinical knowledge of zinc for the common cold, and suggests the present role of zinc therapy and future research needs. zinc (zn) has long been touted as a panacea for common cold. used prophylactically, oral zinc is associated with a reduced cold incidence in children. biochemical evidence suggests that zinc may be an effective treatment, and zinc gluconate glycine (zgg) lozenges have been shown to reduce the duration of cold symptoms in adults. these results provide evidence that zinc nasal gel is effective in shortening the duration of common cold symptoms off when taken within 24 hours of their onset. is oral zinc associated with a shorter duration, decreased severity, and reduced incidence of the common cold compared with placebo? no consistently effective therapy for the common cold has been well documented, but evidence suggests that several possible mechanisms may make zinc an effective treatment. common cold patients may be encouraged to try zinc lozenges for treating their colds. when initiated within 24 hours of symptom onset, oral zinc is associated with a shorter duration of the common cold in healthy people. clinical studies have shown that ionic zinc (zn2+) dissolved in the mouth shortened manifestations of the common cold significantly, by an unknown mechanism. we studied a new approach to zinc therapy--an over-the-counter nasal gel formulation (zicam)--to independently evaluate its efficacy as a treatment for the common cold. there is no evidence that zinc doses over 100 mg/day might lead to greater efficacy in the treatment of the common cold. several controlled clinical trials have shown that zinc gluconate glycine lozenges can reduce symptom severity and duration of symptoms in patients with the common cold. oral zinc has been studied as a possible means of preventing or alleviating symptoms, with mixed results. five trials used zinc doses of 80-92 mg/day, common cold duration was reduced by 33%, and two trials used zinc doses of 192-207 mg/day and found an effect of 35%. previous studies have suggested that oral zinc supplementation can help reduce the duration of the common cold; however, the use of intranasal (in) zinc is strongly associated with anosmia, or the loss of the sense of smell, in humans. three trials that used lozenges composed of zinc acetate found that colds were shortened by 40% and four trials that used zinc gluconate by 28%. recently, intranasal zinc gluconate has been recommended as a treatment for the common cold. to compare the efficacy of zinc acetate lozenges with zinc gluconate lozenges in common cold treatment and to examine the dose-dependency of the effect. intranasal application of zinc gluconate has commonly been used to treat the common cold. |||",Yes
Do probiotics alleviate the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome?,Yes,"The use of probiotics in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) has been increasingly studied, with several studies reporting significant improvements in symptoms compared to placebo. Probiotics have been shown to improve overall IBS symptoms, as well as abdominal pain scores. The mechanisms of action for probiotics in IBS are not fully understood, but they may include altering gut microflora, reducing mucosal inflammation, and exerting antibacterial effects. However, it is important to note that not all studies have reported significant improvements in symptoms after probiotic supplementation, and the results of trials are conflicting. Additionally, the use of specific combinations of probiotics or specific species and strains may be more effective than others. Overall, probiotics have the potential to impact the management of IBS, but further research is needed to fully understand their efficacy and safety.","to review the rationale and current evidence for the efficacy of probiotics in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome (ibs), the following specific questions are addressed from a review of the published literature: are bacterial flora altered in ibs? scientific bases for possible benefits of selected probiotics on irritable bowel symptoms have been identified. what is the efficacy of probiotics in ibs? although probiotics are increasingly used in irritable bowel syndrome (ibs), their mechanism of action has not been elucidated sufficiently. probiotics have been used with apparent success for several gut disorders, so it is not surprising they have been tried in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome (ibs). the efficacy of probiotics for improving clinical symptoms, altering the fecal microbiota, and regulating serum immune cytokine levels was investigated in patients with irritable bowel syndrome-constipation (ibs-c) or functional constipation (fc). there have been many studies suggesting that probiotics are effective in patients with diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (ibs-d). although probiotics have been used for many years by those who suffer from what would now be defined as irritable bowel syndrome (ibs), a scientific rationale for their use in this indication and clinical evidence to support their benefits have only emerged very recently. the use of lactobacilli as probiotics during irritable bowel syndrome is based on their interesting mechanisms of action and their excellent safety profile but little is known about their clinical efficacy due to the lack of adequately designed clinical trials. probiotics may ease symptoms in ibs patients by changing gut microflora, reducing mucosal inflammation and exerting antibacterial effects. probiotics and synbiotics have been shown to improve symptoms of ibs, although mechanisms of action are currently not understood. the aim of this systematic review was to assess the latest randomized controlled trials (rcts) evaluating the effect of probiotic supplementation on symptoms in ibs patients. this study aimed to investigate whether a mixture of lactobacilli probiotics could improve abdominal symptoms in patients with unconstipated ibs. recent studies provide increasing support for the concept that disturbances in gut flora occur in patients with irritable bowel syndrome and that such abnormalities may contribute to irritable bowel syndrome-type symptoms. seven studies (63.6%) reported that supplementation with probiotics in ibs patients significantly improved symptoms compared to placebo, whereas the remaining four studies (36.4%) did not report any significant improvement in symptoms after probiotic supplementation. this systematic review focuses on identifying the efficacy and safety of probiotics in the treatment of ibs. recently, some studies showed probiotics may have a positive effect in ibs and they are widely used to improve the symptom of ibs, which indicate probiotics may play an important role in the treatment of ibs. probiotics may have the potential to impact the management of ibs; however, the results of trials are conflicting. particular combinations of probiotics, or specific species and strains, showed probiotics have beneficial effect on overall ibs symptoms (22 studies, n = 3144, rr of improvement in overall ibs symptoms = 1.5, ci 1.23 to 1.83) or overall ibs symptom and abdominal pain scores (18 studies, n = 2766, smd = -0.31, ci -0.45 to -0.17). more recently, probiotics have been evaluated in the management of specific colonic disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, and clostridium difficile colitis. |||",Yes
Is ivermectin an effective drug for treating covid 19 disease?,Yes,"Ivermectin, an anti-helminthic drug, has been proposed for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19. In vitro studies have shown that ivermectin inhibits the replication of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. A systematic review and meta-analysis of currently available data on the therapeutic potential of ivermectin for the treatment of COVID-19 as an add-on therapy revealed that adding ivermectin led to significant clinical improvement compared to usual therapy. Ivermectin has also demonstrated broad-spectrum antiviral activity against both DNA and RNA viruses. However, further investigation is warranted to explore the potential benefits of ivermectin in humans.","does ivermectin benefit hospitalized coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) patients? ivermectin, an anti-helminthic drug is also being proposed for treatment and prevention of covid-19. ivermectin treatment was associated with lower mortality during treatment of covid-19, especially in patients with severe pulmonary involvement. therefore, ivermectin administered via inhalational route needs to be explored for potential beneficial role in covid-19 in preclinical and clinical studies. hence, we conducted this systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the currently available data on the therapeutic potential of ivermectin for the treatment of covid-19 as add on therapy. it is hypothesised that inhaled formulation of ivermectin may be effective against sars-cov-2. ivermectin was shown to inhibit severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 replication in vitro, which has led to off-label use, but clinical efficacy has not been described previously. we report here that ivermectin, an fda-approved anti-parasitic previously shown to have broad-spectrum anti-viral activity in vitro, is an inhibitor of the causative virus (sars-cov-2), with a single addition to vero-hslam cells 2 h post infection with sars-cov-2 able to effect ~5000-fold reduction in viral rna at 48 h. ivermectin therefore warrants further investigation for possible benefits in humans. ivermectin has demonstrated broad spectrum antiviral activity against both dna and rna viruses. ivermectin, a newly available drug, is well tolerated and effective in onchocerca volvulus infection. similarly, the random effect model revealed that adding ivermectin led to significant clinical improvement compared to usual therapy (or=1.98, 95% ci: 1.11 to 3.53, p=0.02). ivermectin is a broad-spectrum anti-parasitic drug used widely for the treatment of onchocerciasis and lymphatic filariasis. ivermectin, given as a single oral dose, has shown considerable promise as a new treatment for onchocerciasis. amidst the crisis, reports of in vitro inhibitory activity of ivermectin, an approved anthelmintic, against the causative sarscov2 virus, have generated lot of optimism. these results confirm that single-dose ivermectin is effective and well-tolerated and suggest that 150 micrograms of ivermectin/kg may be the optimal dose for initial therapy. thus, ivermectin is suitable for inclusion in mass treatment programmes and is the best therapeutic option presently available to combat onchocerciasis. ivermectin, (=ivomec) a broad spectrum antiparasitic agent has become a promising drug for treating wide range of parasitic infection and infestation. single-dose ivermectin shows promise as the first acceptable treatment for severe onchocercal dermatitis. ivermectin is currently approved for treatment of both clinical and veterinary infections by nematodes, including onchocerca cervicalis in horses and onchocerca volvulus in humans. the results showed that ivermectin is effective at a dose of 200 mg/kg. |||",No
Does carnosine relieve autism symptoms in children?,Yes,"The study found that after 8 weeks of l-carnosine supplementation, children with autism showed statistically significant improvements on the Gilliam Autism Rating Scale (total score and the behavior, socialization, and communication subscales) and the Receptive One-Word Picture Vocabulary Test. Although no significant difference was detected on the irritability subscale scores, l-carnosine add-on can improve hyperactivity/noncompliance subscales of the ABC-C rating scale in patients with ASD. However, supplementation of l-carnosine did not improve the total score of CARS2-ST, ATEC, Bears Sleep Screening Tool, and 6-GSI scores of children with ASD. The mechanism of action of l-carnosine is not well understood, but it may enhance neurologic function, perhaps in the entorhinal or temporal cortex. Further investigations are needed with more objective assessments to critically validate the effectiveness of l-carnosine on ASD children for more decisive results.","this study aimed at investigating the efficacy and tolerability of l-carnosine as an add-on to risperidone in the management of children with autism. after 8 weeks on l-carnosine, children showed statistically significant improvements on the gilliam autism rating scale (total score and the behavior, socialization, and communication subscales) and the receptive one-word picture vocabulary test (all p < .05). there is a paucity of data about the effectiveness of l-carnosine in the management of autism spectrum disorder (asd) in children. this study aimed at investigating the effectiveness of l-carnosine as adjunctive therapy in the management of asd. we investigated 31 children with autistic spectrum disorders in an 8-week, double-blinded study to determine if 800 mg l-carnosine daily would result in observable changes versus placebo. although no significant difference was detected on the irritability subscale scores, l-carnosine add-on can improve hyperactivity/noncompliance subscales of the abc-c rating scale in patients with asd. supplementation of l-carnosine did not improve the total score of cars2-st, atec, bears sleep screening tool and 6-gsi scores of children with asd. some open-label studies suggest that risperidone can be useful in the treatment of certain target symptoms in children with autism. further investigations are needed with more objective assessments to critically validate the effectiveness of l-carnosine on asd children for more decisive results. although the mechanism of action of l-carnosine is not well understood, it may enhance neurologic function, perhaps in the enterorhinal or temporal cortex. we aimed to study whether the use of risperidone in comparison with placebo improved functioning in children with autism with regard to behavior (aggressiveness, hyperactivity, irritability), social and emotional responsiveness, and communication skills. l-carnosine, a dipeptide, can enhance frontal lobe function or be neuroprotective. children aged 3-6 years with a diagnosis of mild to moderate asd were assigned to standard care arm (occupational and speech therapy) and intervention care arm (l-carnosine, 10-15 mg/kg in 2 divided doses) plus standard care treatment. we conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with 40 consecutive children with autism, whose ages ranged from 2 to 9 years, who were receiving either risperidone or placebo given orally at a dose of 1 mg/day for 6 months. the authors report on whether risperidone improves the core symptoms of autism, social and communication impairment and repetitive and stereotyped behavior. in the risperidone group, 12 of 19 children showed improvement in the total childhood autism rating scale score and 17 of 19 children in the children's global assessment scale score compared with 0 of 20 children for the childhood autism rating scale score and 2 of 20 children for the children's global assessment scale score in the placebo group (p < .001 and p = .035, respectively). risperidone improved global functioning and social responsiveness while reducing hyperactivity and aggression in children with autism and was well tolerated. clomipramine, haloperidol, and placebo were compared with baseline in the treatment of autism, and overall outcome, specific symptoms, and side effects were examined. the children were assessed at the baseline and the end of 2 months for the scores of childhood autism rating scale, second edition-standard version (cars2-st), autism treatment evaluation checklist (atec), bears sleep screening tool and 6-item gastrointestinal severity index (6-gsi). risperidone has been found efficacious for decreasing severe tantrums, aggression, and self-injurious behavior in children and adolescents with autistic disorder (autism). |||",No
Can ginkgo extract relieve the symptoms of tinnitus?,No,"The context suggests that Ginkgo Biloba extract has been used in the treatment of tinnitus, particularly in elderly patients, and is a frequently prescribed treatment for this condition.

Therefore, it is not possible to definitively conclude whether Ginkgo extract can relieve the symptoms of tinnitus based on the available information.","to assess the effect of ginkgo biloba in patients who are troubled by tinnitus. there are a number of reports in the literature suggesting that ginkgo biloba may be effective in the management of tinnitus. background ginkgo biloba extract egb 761® and pentoxifylline are frequently prescribed for the treatment of tinnitus. in earlier clinical trials, ginkgo biloba extract egb 761® was found to alleviate tinnitus and dizziness in elderly patients. in conclusion, egb 761(®), a standardized ginkgo biloba extract, is an evidence-based treatment option in tinnitus. there was no evidence that ginkgo biloba was effective for the primary complaint of tinnitus. ginkgo biloba l (ginkgoaceae) is a traditional herbal medicinal plant for the treatment of mild to moderate cognitive disorders, tinnitus, and dementia. the limited evidence did not demonstrate that ginkgo biloba was effective for tinnitus which is a primary complaint. ginkgo biloba is a plant extract used to alleviate symptoms associated with cognitive deficits, e.g., decreased memory performance, lack of concentration, decreased alertness, tinnitus, and dizziness. one of the frequently prescribed treatments is ginkgo biloba extract. ginkgo biloba is commonly used in the treatment of early-stage alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia, peripheral claudication, and tinnitus of vascular origin. there was no reliable evidence to address the question of ginkgo biloba for tinnitus associated with cerebral insufficiency. extract of ginkgo biloba egb 761 has been used in the treatment of various common geriatric complaints including vertigo, short-term memory loss, hearing loss, lack of attention, vigilance and cerebral vascular disorder. pharmacologic studies have shown that the therapeutic effect of ginkgo is based on several active constituents with vasoactive and free radical-scavenging properties. it has been empirically known that ginkgo extract is useful for reducing many symptoms associated with cerebral blood flow (cbf) insufficiency, but its mechanisms have been uncertain. the pharmacologic advantage of ginkgo seems to be a very tolerable side-effect profile, with a side-effect frequency at the placebo level. ginkgo biloba, an extract of the ginkgo tree, may prevent or lessen symptoms of acute mountain sickness in humans. based on these studies, we decided to assess the effectiveness of ginkgo biloba extract (ginko t.d., tolidaru, iran) as an adjunctive agent to risperidone in the treatment of autism. a positive difference is in favor of ginkgo. the present results suggest that ginkgo extract contains a substance which increases normal cbf and reduces ischemic brain damage. |||",No

Can inhalation with budesonide spray relieve symptoms of covid-19?,Yes,"The provided context discusses the use of budesonide in managing loss of smell in COVID-19 patients and its effects on various respiratory conditions such as asthma and COPD. However, it does not provide direct evidence on the efficacy of inhaled budesonide in relieving the general symptoms of COVID-19. The context primarily focuses on the impact of budesonide on airway responsiveness, inflammation, and cough in patients with asthma and COPD. Therefore, it is not possible to definitively conclude whether inhalation with budesonide spray can relieve symptoms of COVID-19 based on the provided information. Further research is needed to establish the role of budesonide in managing the symptoms of COVID-19.","to assess the efficacy of local intranasal treatment with budesonide (nasal irrigation), in addition to olfactory rehabilitation, in the management of loss of smell in covid-19 patients without signs of severity and with persistent hyposmia 30 days after the onset of symptoms. we conclude that in pollen-sensitive subjects with mild asthma, inhaled budesonide blocks the effects of natural allergen exposure on the methacholine threshold value. atopic copd patients not treated with budesonide had an increased incidence of cough over time (or: 1.79, 95% ci: 1.03-3.08, p = 0.038), while those treated with budesonide had increased remission of cough (or: 1.93, 95% ci: 1.11-3.37, p = 0.02) compared to non-atopic copd patients. the aim of this study was to determine the effect of inhaled budesonide on the perception of breathlessness induced by histamine challenge. we conclude that treatment with budesonide enhances the perception of airway narrowing, but the effect is unrelated to budesonide dose, or to changes in circulating eosinophil markers. budesonide significantly inhibited the increase in airway responsiveness but not the eosinophilic inflammation induced by exposure to tma dust in sensitized guinea pigs. budesonide did not inhibit the number of subepithelial eosinophils of guinea pigs exposed to tma dust (54.0 +/- 3.7 cells/unit area) or in those exposed to air (24.3 +/- 6.7 cells/unit area) and did not affect the increase in eosinophils found in bronchoalveolar fluid. the effects of inhaled budesonide (800 micrograms.day-1) on the threshold value (pc20) and maximal response plateau to inhaled methacholine were studied in 28 pollen-sensitive subjects with mild asthma during a pollen season in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel fashion. the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of inhaled budesonide on modifications of the provocative concentration of agonist causing a 20% fall in forced expiratory volume in one second (fev1) (pc20) and maximal response plateau to inhaled methacholine during the pollen season in pollen-sensitive subjects with mild asthma. if atopic copd patients are treated with budesonide, they more often show remission of symptoms compared to non-atopic copd patients who are treated with budesonide. thirty-five subjects with poorly controlled asthma were randomized to receive budesonide (1,600 or 3,200 microg/d) for 8 wk, followed by 8 wk at 1,600 microg/d and subsequent downtitration according to a clinical algorithm. we assessed the effect of a nebulized corticosteroid, budesonide, on airway hyperresponsiveness and inflammatory response provoked by inhalation of trimellitic anhydride (tma) dust, a known cause of occupational asthma in human beings, in guinea pigs sensitized to the free hapten. subjects treated with budesonide (n = 13) were protected from the decrease in pc20 seen in the placebo (n = 15) group (geometric mean pc20 placebo group: preseasonal = 8.51, may = 2.19 and june = 1.78 mg.ml-1; budesonide group: preseasonal = 3.71, may = 3.23 and june = 2.40 mg.ml-1; intergroup differences in doubling concentrations, p < 0.05). male dunkin-hartley guinea pigs (n = 24) were injected intradermally with 0.1 ml of 0.3% tma in corn oil, followed by exposure 21 to 28 days later to five consecutive doses of budesonide aerosol (0.5 mg/ml) or saline solution, administered for 10 minutes every 12 hours. the european respiratory society study on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (euroscop) investigated long-term effects of budesonide; 18% of the copd participants were atopic. the participants will be recruited from: hôpital fondation adolphe de rothschild and hôpital lariboisière in paris, france intervention and comparator: intervention: experimental group: nasal irrigation with budesonide and physiological saline (budesonide 1mg/2ml diluted in 250ml of physiological saline 9°/00): 3 syringes of 20ml in each nasal cavity, morning and evening, for 30 days, in addition to olfactory rehabilitation twice a day. we tested the hypothesis that inhaled combined long-acting beta2-agonist (salmeterol) and corticosteroid (fluticasone propionate) will reduce inflammation. there have been suggestions that corticosteroid treatment might improve bronchodilator responses in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd). we report a study investigating the effect of inhaled beclomethasone diproprionate (bdp) on lung function and symptoms in a group of patients with copd. systemic corticosteroids have been recommended as a therapeutic option in patients with moderate to severe copd. |||",Yes
Are rapid antigen tests as reliable as slower PCR tests? Does a negative (inconspicuous) rapid test result reliably exclude an infection with the coronavirus?,No,"The rapid serological test had a sensitivity of 30% and a specificity of 89% compared to the standard RT-PCR assay. This indicates that rapid antigen tests are less reliable than RT-PCR tests in detecting the virus. A negative rapid test result does not reliably exclude an infection with the coronavirus, as the test may produce false-negative results. In contrast, RT-PCR testing is the gold standard for confirming COVID-19 infection, despite its disadvantages. However, technical issues limit its utilization for large-scale screening. Low-dose chest CT is a safe, rapid, and reliable alternative to RT-PCR for the diagnosis of COVID-19 in high-prevalence regions.","to determine sensitivity of rapid diagnostic tests for detecting influenza a(h7n9) virus, we compared rapid tests with pcr results and tested different types of clinical samples. real-time polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) remains the gold standard for confirmation of coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) despite having many disadvantages. here, we investigated the diagnostic performance of chest computed tomography (ct) as an alternative to rt-pcr in patients with clinical suspicion of covid-19 infection. the objective of our study was to compare the results of the rapid serological vivadiag test for sars-cov-2-related igm/igg detection with those of the standard rt-pcr laboratory test for identifying sars-cov-2 nucleic acid. the sensitivity of reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) has been questioned due to negative results in some patients who were strongly suspected of having coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19). despite an initially less serious clinical presentation, the mortality of patients infected by sars-cov-2 with a negative rt-pcr did not differ from those with positive rt-pcr. the protocols of who network laboratories facilitated development of rapid diagnosis for sars coronavirus (cov) using reverse transcription (rt)-pcr assays. as no sars cov was detected among specimens collected during post-epidemic period, the positive predictive value of real-time pcr assays for detection of sars cov during low epidemic requires further evaluation. these results indicate that small quantities of the virus that cause false-negative ridt results can be detected efficiently with qrt-pcr follow-up. real-time polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) testing for the identification of viral nucleic acid is the current standard for the diagnosis of sars-cov-2 infection, but technical issues limit its utilization for large-scale screening. the results provided by a new rapid serological colorimetric test for analyzing igm/igg expression were compared with those of rt-pcr testing for sars-cov-2 detection. low-dose chest ct is a safe, rapid and reliable alternative to rt-pcr for the diagnosis of covid-19 in high-prevalence regions. currently, diagnosis of influenza is performed either through tedious polymerase chain reaction (pcr) or through rapid antigen detection assays. testing for the presence of coronavirus is an essential diagnostic tool for monitoring and managing the current covid-19 pandemic. tests for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2) based on reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) are being used to rule out infection among high-risk persons, such as exposed inpatients and health care workers. the rapid serological test had a sensitivity of 30% and a specificity of 89% compared to the standard rt-pcr assay. molecular assays based on reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) provide reliable results for the detection of respiratory pathogens, although diagnostic agreement varies. after 10 days had passed since symptom appearance, the predictive value of the rapid serological test was higher than that of the standard molecular assay (proportion of positive results: 40% vs 20%). rapid but yet sensitive, specific, and high-throughput detection of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2) in clinical samples is key to diagnose infected people and to better control the spread of the virus. the aim of our study was to analyze the prognosis of infected patients with initial negative rt-pcr in the emergency department (ed) during the covid-19 outbreak. |||",No
Are heavy (ex-)smokers less likely to die of lung cancer if they regularly participate in lung cancer screening by computed tomography (CT)?,Yes,".

     The National Lung Screening Trial demonstrated a significant reduction in lung cancer-specific mortality among high-risk current and former smokers who underwent yearly low-dose chest computed tomography (CT) screening. This finding was further supported by a recent randomized screening trial, which also showed a reduction in lung cancer mortality with CT scans. The US Preventive Services Task Force recommends annual lung cancer screening with low-dose CT for current and former smokers aged 55-80 years with a 30-pack-year smoking history. The risk-based model for CT screening for lung cancer was estimated to be associated with a greater number of lung cancer deaths prevented over 5 years compared to a model based on USPSTF recommendations. In a trial involving high-risk persons, lung-cancer mortality was significantly lower among those who underwent volume CT screening than among those who underwent no screening. The preliminary results of the National Lung Screening Trial confirmed that lung cancer screening by CT is associated with a reduction in lung cancer mortality compared to a control group undergoing chest X-ray at the same time intervals. Current and former smokers with COPD may disproportionately benefit from lung cancer screening.","the national lung screening trial demonstrated a lung cancer-specific mortality benefit in high-risk current and former smokers with yearly low-dose chest computed tomography (ct). emphasizing the risk of lung cancer can encourage smoking cessation; however, computerized tomography (ct) scans reduced lung cancer mortality in a recent randomized screening trial. lung cancer screening with low-dose chest ct has been demonstrated to reduce lung cancer mortality among a subset of high-risk current and former smokers. lung cancer screening with annual low-dose computed tomography (ct) decreases lung cancer mortality in high-risk patients, as defined by smoking history (> 30 pack-years) and age (55-74 years). current and former smokers are currently being screened for lung cancer with computed tomography (ct), although there are limited data on the effect screening has on lung cancer outcomes. lung cancer screening with low dose computed tomography (ct) is the only method ever proven to reduce lung cancer-specific mortality in high-risk current and former cigarette smokers. lung cancer screening with annual chest computed tomography (ct) is recommended for current and former smokers with a ≥30-pack-year smoking history. lung cancer screening with chest computed tomography (ct) reduces lung cancer death. among a cohort of us ever-smokers aged 50 to 80 years, application of a risk-based model for ct screening for lung cancer compared with a model based on uspstf recommendations was estimated to be associated with a greater number of lung cancer deaths prevented over 5 years, along with a lower nns to prevent 1 lung cancer death. in this trial involving high-risk persons, lung-cancer mortality was significantly lower among those who underwent volume ct screening than among those who underwent no screening. screening for lung cancer with low-dose ct may increase the rate of lung cancer diagnosis and treatment, but may not meaningfully reduce the risk of advanced lung cancer or death from lung cancer. perhaps, recommendations from multiple cancer screenings may promote smoking abstinence among individuals at high risk for lung carcinoma. the relation between undergoing a single computed tomography (ct) screening for lung carcinoma and the potential long-term impact on smoking status has been equivocal. empirical risk models for lung cancer incidence and death in the absence of ct screening using data on ever-smokers from the prostate, lung, colorectal, and ovarian cancer screening trial (plco; 1993-2009) control group. recent guidelines recommend chest computed tomography (ct) for smokers based on studies of individuals aged 55 to 74 years with 30-pack year smoking to detect lung cancers. computed tomography (ct)-based lung cancer screening may provide an opportunity to detect additional individuals with copd at an early stage. low-dose computed tomography (ct) screening can detect early stage lung cancer in high-risk populations. lung cancer mortality was favourable compared to age- and sex-matched population of us smokers, suggesting that mortality can be lowered by screening, although larger trials with longer follow-up are necessary to confirm these findings. recently, the preliminary results of the randomised controlled national lung screening trial (nlst), a study organised by the us national cancer institute, confirmed for the first time that lung cancer screening by ct is associated with a reduction in lung cancer mortality (20.3%) and in all-cause mortality (7%) compared with a control group undergoing cxr at the same time intervals. current and former smokers with copd may disproportionately benefit from lung cancer screening. |||",Yes
Can lung cancer screening by computed tomography (CT) also do harm???,Yes,"Justification: While low-dose computed tomography (CT) screening for lung cancer has been shown to reduce lung cancer mortality, it is not without potential harms. These include overdiagnosis, false positives, and invasive procedures for benign nodules. Overdiagnosis can lead to unnecessary treatment and associated complications, while false positives can cause anxiety and further invasive testing. The risks for false-positive results on lung cancer screening tests are substantial after only 2 annual examinations, particularly for low-dose CT. Further study is warranted to fully understand the economic, psychosocial, and physical burdens of these methods.","screening for lung cancer with low-dose ct may increase the rate of lung cancer diagnosis and treatment, but may not meaningfully reduce the risk of advanced lung cancer or death from lung cancer. annual computed tomography (ct) is now widely recommended for lung cancer screening in the united states, although concerns remain regarding the potential harms, including those from overdiagnosis. low-dose computed tomography (ct) screening for lung cancer can reduce lung cancer mortality, but overdiagnosis, false positives and invasive procedures for benign nodules are worrying. lung cancer screening using computed tomography (ct) is effective in detecting lung cancer in early stages. screening for lung cancer with low-dose computed tomography (ct) is controversial. computed tomography (ct) screening of the chest has shown promise for early detection of lung cancer, but evidence for a reduction in lung cancer mortality by ct screening is not available. lung cancer screening with chest computed tomography (ct) reduces lung cancer death. the use of computerized tomography (ct) scans has been recently brought into attention to help screen high risk individuals for lung cancer. evidence from previous controlled trials of chest radiography and sputum cytology does not support lung cancer screening, but computed tomography (ct) screening has recently emerged as a more sensitive screening tool. current and former smokers are currently being screened for lung cancer with computed tomography (ct), although there are limited data on the effect screening has on lung cancer outcomes. evidence regarding lung cancer screening by ct shows that this technology detects earlier-stage and smaller lung cancers with greater frequency than other screening methods. as we sit on the brink of widespread adoption of lung cancer screening ct, we aim to explain why the risks associated with radiation exposure from lung cancer screening are very low and should not be used to avoid screening or dissuade individuals who qualify for screening ct to participate in a lung cancer screening program. low-dose computed tomography (ct) screening was shown to reduce lung cancer-specific mortality in a large randomized trial of a high-risk population. low-dose ct screening has been associated with a 20% reduction in lung cancer mortality in a large randomized controlled trial (national lung screening trial [nlst]) of a high-risk population. risks for false-positive results on lung cancer screening tests are substantial after only 2 annual examinations, particularly for low-dose ct. further study of resulting economic, psychosocial, and physical burdens of these methods is warranted. to discuss the evidence for use of chest x-rays and low-dose ct in screening for lung cancer; to describe potential benefits, harms, and uncertainties of ct screening; and to review current guidelines for ct screening. lung cancer screening with low dose computed tomography (ct) is the only method ever proven to reduce lung cancer-specific mortality in high-risk current and former cigarette smokers. further evaluation is necessary to determine if cad chest radiography has a role as a lung cancer screening tool. this paper reviews the issue of lung cancer screening and low-dose spiral ct. the results of the current study indicate that ct screening along with early stage treatment can reduce lung cancer-specific mortality. |||",Yes

Nonetheless, the overall evidence suggests that Echinacea may be beneficial in reducing the incidence and duration of the common cold.","published evidence supports echinacea's benefit in decreasing the incidence and duration of the common cold. echinacea is a widely used herbal remedy for the treatment of colds and other infections. some studies have concluded that echinacea effectively reduces the symptoms and duration of the common cold. echinacea, a native of north america, is widely used to prevent, or provide early treatment for, colds. the objective of this review was to assess the effects of preparations containing extracts of echinacea in the prevention and treatment of the common cold. echinacea is a popular herbal medicine used in the treatment of common cold and it is also a prominent dietary supplement used throughout the world. are echinacea products associated with a reduced incidence and a shorter duration of common colds compared with placebo? echinacea is one of the most commonly used herbal products, but controversy exists about its benefit in the prevention and treatment of the common cold. echinacea is an herbal supplement commonly used as an immune system stimulant to prevent infections, such as the common cold or flu. echinacea decreased the odds of developing the common cold by 58% (or 0.42; 95% ci 0.25-0.71; q statistic p<0.001) and the duration of a cold by 1.4 days (wmd -1.44, -2.24 to -0.64; p=0.01). echinacea preparations are widely used herbal medicines for the prevention and treatment of colds and minor infections. individual prophylaxis trials show no association with prevention of the common cold, but exploratory meta-analysis suggests that echinacea products may be associated with a small reduction in cold incidence. numerous clinical trials have been carried out on echinacea preparations: it appears that the extracts shorten the duration and severity of colds and other upper respiratory infections (uris) when given as soon as symptoms become evident. recently, echinacea has regained popularity as one of the treatments chosen most commonly by consumers with the expectation that it will reduce the severity and duration of the common cold. in addition to widespread use in reducing the symptoms of colds and flu, echinacea is traditionally employed to treat fungal and bacterial infections. echinacea extracts have traditionally been used in the treatment of many infectious and other diseases (such as rhinovirus colds), and research has revealed the presence of various bioactivities in these extracts, particularly those connected with immune responses. preparations of echinacea are widely used as alternative remedies to prevent the common cold and infections in the upper respiratory tract. echinacea supplementation may assist with the symptoms of acute respiratory infections (ari) and the common cold, particularly when administered at the first sign of infection; however, no studies using echinacea in the prevention or treatment of conditions similar to covid-19 have been identified. current evidence suggests that echinacea supplementation may decrease the duration and severity of acute respiratory tract infections; however, no studies using echinacea in the prevention or treatment of conditions similar to covid-19 have been identified. thus, we did a meta-analysis evaluating the effect of echinacea on the incidence and duration of the common cold. |||",Yes
Can light therapy with light lamps relieve the symptoms of autumn-winter depression?,Yes,"The context provided indicates that light therapy, including the use of light lamps, has been shown to be an effective treatment for seasonal and non-seasonal major depression. Specifically, a 1- to 2-week open trial of bright (greater than or equal to 2,000 lux) incandescent light with seasonal (fall/winter) and nonseasonal depressives produced a therapeutic effect on seasonal depression. This effect was measured by three criteria for recovery: final score on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD) less than 10; final HRSD score less than or equal to 50% of pretreatment HRSD score; and no longer meeting DSM-III criteria for major depressive disorder. Additionally, a meta-analysis including 881 participants from 20 randomized controlled trials demonstrated a beneficial effect of light therapy in non-seasonal depression. These findings suggest that light therapy, including the use of light lamps, can be an effective treatment for relieving the symptoms of autumn-winter depression.","observations from clinical trials have frequently demonstrated that light therapy can be an effective therapy for seasonal and non-seasonal major depression. light therapy has been successfully used to treat seasonal and non-seasonal depression, but there is limited evidence for its efficacy in subthreshold depression. the present study, a 1- to 2-week open trial of bright (greater than or equal to 2,000 lux) incandescent light with seasonal (fall/winter) and nonseasonal depressives, produced a therapeutic effect on seasonal depression, as measured by three criteria for recovery: final score on the hamilton rating scale for depression (hrsd) less than 10; final hrsd score less than or equal to 50% of pretreatment hrsd score; no longer meets dsm-iii criteria for major depressive disorder. investigators, in studies demonstrating the usefulness of bright light therapy, also have implicated light's role in non-seasonal depression. previous reports have shown that bright light exposure may benefit patients with seasonal depression. previous studies suggest that light therapy, as used to treat seasonal affective disorder, may be beneficial for pre-menstrual depressive disorders. however, considering that light therapy has minimal side-effects and our meta-analysis demonstrated that a significant proportion of patients achieved a clinically significant response, light therapy may be effective for patients with non-seasonal depression and can be a helpful additional therapeutic intervention for depression. light therapy is a known treatment for patients with seasonal affective disorder. light therapy is a well-established treatment option for seasonal affective disorders and is effective in reducing sleep problems and daytime fatigue. this study examines the efficacy of light therapy for symptoms of depression and anxiety in non-seasonal subthreshold depression. light therapy (lt) has been widely used in the treatment of seasonal affective disorder. antidepressant and energizing effects of bright light exposure (phototherapy) have been widely reported to occur in patients with seasonal affective disorder. to provide the current state of evidence for efficacy of light therapy in non-seasonal depressive disorders. light therapy, both at high- and low-intensity, was efficacious in the treatment of college students with non-seasonal subthreshold depression. in the present study, the possible therapeutic effect of bright light in nonseasonal major depressive disorder was examined. our findings suggest that light therapy is generally applicable to depressive illnesses, and that the light intensities commonly used are suboptimal. a meta-analysis including 881 participants from 20 rcts demonstrated a beneficial effect of light therapy in non-seasonal depression (standardised mean difference in depression score -0.41 (95% ci -0.64 to -0.18)). a highly predictable onset of a recurrent depressive episode with seasonal pattern provides a rationale for testing the efficacy of bright-light treatment as a preventive measure. phototherapy is regularly used in the treatment of seasonal affective disorder. the effects of treatment with bright light in different forms of depressive conditions are described. |||",Yes
Does taking coenzyme Q10 improve movement disorders in Parkinson's disease?,No,"The therapeutic value of coenzyme Q10 in Parkinson's disease is still being tested, and the preliminary results are promising.

Does treatment with focused high-intensity ultrasound (HIFU) reduce abdominal girth?,Yes,"High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) has been found to be an effective treatment for reducing localized adiposities in the abdominal region. HIFU treatment has been shown to effectively reduce abdominal fat in a porcine model, accurately targeting the subcutaneous fat layer and reducing it effectively as measured by ultrasound. HIFU is also an effective and safe modality for reducing waist circumference in nonobese individuals with focal fat accumulation. The use of non-invasive devices for fat reduction involving HIFU has been gaining attention, and a thermal HIFU device for abdominal body shaping has been evaluated for its efficacy and safety. HIFU treatment at different energy levels and multiple tissue depths was well tolerated and effective in reducing waist circumference. HIFU has also been proven effective in body sculpting when used noninvasively to reduce subcutaneous fat and improve body contour. Therefore, it can be concluded that treatment with focused high-intensity ultrasound (HIFU) reduces abdominal girth.","high-intensity focused ultrasound (hifu) treatment is a non-surgical fat reduction procedure that permanently destroys unwanted abdominal fat. high-intensity focused ultrasound was found to be an effective treatment in reducing localized adiposities in the abdominal region. hifu treatment effectively reduced abdominal fat in a porcine model; it accurately treated the target subcutaneous fat layer and the subcutaneous fat was reduced effectively via ultrasonic measurement after hifu treatment. high-intensity focused ultrasound is an effective and safe treatment modality for reducing waist circumference in nonobese individuals with focal fat accumulation. nonfocused low-intensity ultrasound is generally believed to be less efficacious than high-intensity focused ultrasound (hifu) at body fat reduction; nevertheless, this technology has already been widely used clinically for body contouring purposes. high-intensity focused ultrasound effectively decreases waist circumference in chinese. non-invasive devices for fat reduction involving high-intensity focused ultrasound (hifu) are attracting attention. we evaluated the efficacy and safety of a thermal high-intensity focused ultrasound (hifu) device for abdominal body shaping. hifu treatment at different energy levels and multiple tissue depths was well tolerated and effective in reducing waist circumference. high-intensity focused ultrasound (hifu) is a non-invasive uterine-preserving treatment alternative to hysterectomy for women with fibroids. high-intensity focused ultrasound (hifu) has been proven effective in body sculpting when used noninvasively to reduce subcutaneous fat and improve body contour. high intensity focused ultrasound (hifu) treatment in the abdominal cavity is challenging due to the respiratory motion. high-intensity focused ultrasound (hifu) is a minimally invasive technique that has been used for the treatment of both benign and malignant tumours. this study validated nonfocused low-intensity ultrasound as an effective and safe method for body fat reduction, especially with repetitive treatment. although high intensity focused ultrasound (hifu) is a promising technology for tumor treatment, a moving abdominal target is still a challenge in current hifu systems. high-intensity focused ultrasound (hifu) has been applied clinically for the noninvasive treatment of pathological conditions in various organs for over 50 years; however, there are little data describing the use of thermal hifu to ablate fat for body contouring and treatment of collagen-rich layers. high-intensity focused ultrasound (hifu) is a noninvasive thermodestructive procedure targeting internal organs with concentrated sonification energy that may cause pain. the clinical use of high intensity focused ultrasound (hifu) therapy for noninvasive tissue ablation has been recently gaining momentum. high-intensity focused ultrasound (hifu) is a noninvasive technology for body contouring. high-intensity focused ultrasound (hifu) is a highly precise medical procedure used locally to heat and destroy diseased tissue through ablation. |||",Yes
Does melatonin help against jet lag?,Yes,"Melatonin has been shown to have therapeutic potential for alleviating jet lag. Its circadian effects in humans have led to its use in treating jet lag and circadian-based sleep disorders. The hormone melatonin, produced by the pineal gland, plays a role in maintaining sleep-wake rhythms and can help regulate sleep disturbances associated with jet lag. Both field and simulated studies have demonstrated that appropriately timed melatonin can improve sleep and hasten the readaptation of circadian rhythms following a phase shift. Furthermore, recent studies support the use of melatonin as a remedy for jet lag on long-haul flights. Melatonin has been shown to significantly reduce sleep-onset latency, improve mood, and improve daytime functioning. It has also been found to improve the quality and depth of nighttime sleep, reduce the number of nighttime awakenings, and increase the duration of sleep without producing a morning hangover. Therefore, it can be concluded that melatonin is helpful in alleviating jet lag.","it has been suggested that melatonin may have therapeutic potential for alleviating jet lag. we concluded the use of oral melatonin probably reduces symptoms associated with jet lag syndrome. the circadian effects of melatonin in humans have led to its use to treat jet lag and circadian-based sleep disorders. the role of the pineal gland hormone, melatonin, in the synchronization of biological rhythms has raised interest in its use to alleviate jet lag. melatonin is being increasingly promoted as a treatment for ""jet lag"" and insomnia and has been suggested to act as an antioxidant in vivo. melatonin plays a role in maintaining sleep-wake rhythms; supplementation may help to regulate sleep disturbance that occur with jet lag, rotating shift-work and depression. thus, there is considerable clinical interest in using melatonin to treat disorders, such as jet-lag. both in field and simulated studies of jet lag and shift work suitably timed melatonin improved sleep and, in some cases, hastened readaptation of the circadian rhythms following the phase shift. the pineal hormone melatonin (n-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine) is normally secreted at night: in animals it serves to transmit information about light-dark cycles to body physiology suitable timed administration will alleviate 'jet-lag' severity ratings in humans, the major effect being to improve sleep. indeed, recent studies support the use of this well-tolerated drug as a remedy for jet lag on long-haul flights. subjectively, melatonin also significantly reduced sleep-onset latency, heightened freshness on awakening, improved mood, and improved daytime functioning (p < .05). if used in physiologic doses and at appropriate times, melatonin can be helpful for those suffering from insomnia or circadian rhythm disorders. pharmacological doses of melatonin were reported to have sleep-inducing effects in insomniacs. although melatonin is approved only for the treatment of jet-lag syndrome and some types of insomnia, clinical data suggest that it is effective in the adjunctive therapy of osteoporosis, cataract, sepsis, neurodegenerative diseases, hypertension, and even cancer. relative to placebo, melatonin significantly improved the quality and depth of nighttime sleep, reduced the number of nighttime awakenings, and increased the duration of sleep without producing a morning hangover (p < .05). it has been suggested that the pineal hormone melatonin can modulate circadian rhythmicity and may have clinical utility in treating biological clock disorders. compared with placebo, melatonin advanced the sleep period in subjects with dsps. our results show a clear stabilizing effect of melatonin on sleep onset time with elimination of day time sleep, but no entrainment of rectal temperature or urinary cortisol rhythms. jet lag syndrome is an exogenous circadian rhythm sleep disorder, frequently reported in travelers who cross multiple time zones in a short period of time. oral melatonin -a pineal neurohormone normally produced during darkness and responsible for regulating the body's circadian rhythms- has been used as treatment for this condition. |||",Yes
Are international travel restrictions and border health checks effective in curbing the spread of covid-19?,Yes,"Justification: The context suggests that various strategies, including travel restrictions and border health checks, have been implemented to reduce and slow the spread of COVID-19. These measures, such as the closure or severe restriction of border transit, quarantines, and self-isolation, have been used to limit the further spread of the virus. The effectiveness of these measures is supported by the fact that they have been recommended by the World Health Organization and adopted by numerous countries worldwide. Furthermore, the context indicates that these measures have led to a significant reduction in international passenger traffic, suggesting their effectiveness in curbing the spread of COVID-19.","travel restrictions have become a common disease control measure during the 2019 coronavirus disease pandemic (covid-19). in response to the covid-19 pandemic, countries have implemented various strategies to reduce and slow the spread of the disease in the general population. at the time of writing, in july 2020, the covid-19 pandemic has already inflicted dramatic international restrictions, including airports closing and limiting international travel. after officially declared as a pandemic by the world health organization (who), drastic measures to restrict human movements to contain the covid-19 infection are employed by most of the countries. these findings can support evidence-based policy to combat the spread of covid-19, and prospective planning to mitigate future emerging pathogens. to slow down the spread of covid-19, governments worldwide are trying to identify infected people, and contain the virus by enforcing isolation, and quarantine. covid-19 pandemic provoked a number of restrictive measures, such as the closure or severe restriction of border transit for international trading traffic, quarantines and self-isolation. traveller screening is being used to limit further spread of covid-19 following its recent emergence, and symptom screening has become a ubiquitous tool in the global response. since the world health organization (who) declared covid-19 a global pandemic, several strict measures have been recommended to prevent and control the spread of the virus worldwide. the worldwide consensus that physical distancing is an effective instrument for mitigating the spread of the virus has led policymakers to temporarily limit the freedom of movement of people between and within countries, cities, and even neighborhoods. with covid-19 spreading around the world, many countries are exposed to the imported case risk from inbound international flights. the covid-19 pandemic is impacting national and international public health. therefore, this study aimed to assess the impact of precautionary measures to contain the covid-19 outbreak. vaccine entry requirements have proved effective in controlling the international spread of yellow fever but more can be done to ensure better use of this measure. precautionary measures adopted by the saudi arabian health authorities were evidently effective in controlling the spread and further burden of covid-19. in response to the covid-19 pandemic, numerous countries worldwide declared national states of emergency and implemented interventions to minimise the risk of transmission among the public. this study examined commercial airline passengers' health concerns and attitudes towards infection prevention and control measures for travel health and safety in the current covid-19 global pandemic. covid-19 and its associated travel bans have reduced international passenger traffic by over 80% below 2019 levels. for countries that have implemented restrictions on its population in a step-wise manner, monitoring of covid-19 prevalence is of importance to guide decision on when to impose new, or when to abolish old, restrictions. evidence was needed to inform strategies for limiting covid-19 transmission on public transport. |||",Yes
Does denosumab (Prolia) reduce the risk of vertebral fractures in osteoporosis?,Yes,"Justification: Denosumab has been shown to significantly reduce the risk of new vertebral fractures in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis, as evidenced by multiple randomized controlled trials. The Freedom trial demonstrated that denosumab reduced bone resorption, increased bone mineral density, and decreased the risk of new vertebral, hip, and nonvertebral fractures in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. Compared to placebo, denosumab significantly reduced the risk of new vertebral fractures in women with multiple and/or severe prevalent vertebral fractures. Denosumab is an approved therapy for postmenopausal women with osteoporosis at high or increased risk for fracture, and has been shown to be an efficacious and safe osteoporosis treatment option with sustained fracture risk reduction.","denosumab reduced the incidence of new vertebral and hip fractures in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis at higher risk for fracture. denosumab is a potent antiresorptive drug leading to significant reduction in the risk of vertebral and non-vertebral fractures in postmenopausal osteoporosis. denosumab significantly decreased the risk of clinical osteoporotic fractures in postmenopausal women. denosumab has been shown to reduce new vertebral, nonvertebral, and hip fractures in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. in randomized controlled trials, denosumab has been shown to significantly reduce the fracture risk in women with osteoporosis. denosumab, a rankl inhibitor, reduced the risk of vertebral, hip, and nonvertebral fractures in the fracture reduction evaluation of denosumab in osteoporosis every 6 months (freedom) trial of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis compared with placebo. the freedom (fracture reduction evaluation of denosumab in osteoporosis every 6 months) trial showed denosumab significantly reduced the risk of fractures in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. denosumab reduced bone resorption, increased bone mineral density (bmd), and decreased new vertebral, hip, and nonvertebral fracture risk in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis in the freedom trial. this paper presents a summary of the evidence review group (erg) report into denosumab for the prevention of osteoporotic fractures in postmenopausal women. we evaluated the effect of denosumab on the incidence of new vertebral and hip fractures in subgroups of women at higher risk for these fractures. studies in women with post-menopausal osteoporosis have shown that discontinuation of treatment with denosumab leads to an increased risk of vertebral fractures because of rebound bone turnover and rapid loss of bone mineral density (bmd). compared with placebo, denosumab significantly reduced the risk of new vertebral fractures in women with multiple and/or severe prevalent vertebral fractures (16.6% placebo vs. 7.5% denosumab; p < 0.001). denosumab has been shown to reduce the incidence of vertebral, nonvertebral, and hip fractures. denosumab is an approved therapy for postmenopausal women with osteoporosis at high or increased risk for fracture. in the freedom study, denosumab reduced fracture risk and increased bone mineral density (bmd). denosumab has been shown in a large randomised trial to reduce the frequency of osteoporotic fractures when given subcutaneously at 6-monthly intervals. denosumab is an efficacious and safe osteoporosis treatment option, with current data from up to 8 years of continued use showing continued improvement in bone density with sustained fracture risk reduction. denosumab specifically inhibits the receptor activator for nuclear factor-kappa b ligand (rankl), and prevents osteoporotic fractures. denosumab reduced fracture risk to a greater extent in those at moderate to high risk. clinical vertebral fractures occurred in 0.8% of women taking denosumab and 2.6% of control subjects. |||",Yes
Do people with blood group AB have a higher risk of developing dementia?,No,"The study showed no association between ABO blood group and risk of Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia, or unspecified dementia. The results provide no evidence that ABO blood group influences the risk of dementia. However, recent data indicates that blood group AB is associated with impaired cognition in elderly patients, and there is a higher incidence of cognitive deficits in ABO blood-type system 'AB' individuals. Additionally, ABO blood group has been linked to the risks for cardiovascular diseases and cancers that affect lifespan. A potential role for the ABI3 gene has been suggested in the risk of Alzheimer's disease, but the detailed mechanism before typical AD onset was unclear.

Is it possible to reliably detect coronavirus infection based only on symptoms but without laboratory testing?,No,"The diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) primarily relies on viral nucleic acid detection, as the clinical features are nonspecific and can be similar to other respiratory pathogens. In the absence of laboratory-based tests, such as a virus nucleic acid real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test, clinical diagnosis can be challenging. The presumed low diagnostic sensitivity of upper respiratory specimens for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) makes it difficult to confirm infection and recommend de-isolation. Therefore, it is not possible to reliably detect coronavirus infection based only on symptoms without laboratory testing.","the current diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (sars-cov) relies on laboratory-based tests since its clinical features are nonspecific, unlike other respiratory pathogens. in the absence of a virus nucleic acid real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) test and experienced radiologists, clinical diagnosis is challenging for viral pneumonia with clinical symptoms and ct signs similar to that of coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19). rapid spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (sars-cov-2) and concern for viral transmission by ambulatory patients with minimal to no symptoms underline the importance of identifying early or subclinical symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) infection. although direct detection of sars-cov2 in symptomatic or asymptomatic individuals is the ideal epidemiological tool for determining the burden of disease, the lack of availability of testing can preclude its wider implementation as a robust surveillance system. the diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 using biomarkers and indicators at point-of-care level is much crucial. the presumed low diagnostic sensitivity of upper respiratory specimens for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (sars-cov-2) makes it difficult to confirm infection and recommend de-isolation. the diagnosis of coronavirus 19 (covid-19) relies mainly upon viral nucleic acid detection, but false negatives can lead to missed diagnosis and misdiagnosis; severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2)-specific antibody detection is convenient, safe and highly sensitive. rapid but yet sensitive, specific, and high-throughput detection of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2) in clinical samples is key to diagnose infected people and to better control the spread of the virus. central and peripheral nervous system symptoms and complications are being increasingly recognized among individuals with pandemic sars-cov-2 infections, but actual detection of the virus or its rna in the central nervous system has rarely been sought or demonstrated. in this study, a simple colorimetric and multiplex loop-mediated isothermal amplification (lamp) assay was developed to rapid screening of severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (sars-cov). computed tomography (ct) of the chest can verify infection in patients with clinical symptoms and a negative test result, accelerating treatment and actions to prevent further contagion. detection of the virus in cutaneous samples has been assessed in very few cases until now, and the causative role of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2) has not been proven for every type of cutaneous manifestations yet. usually, there is no indication to perform diagnostic imaging or run laboratory tests in patients with bronchiolitis since the diagnosis is based on the clinical presentation. the diagnosis of acute hepatitis c virus (hcv) infection is not straightforward; few people exhibit clinical symptoms and genome/antigen detection techniques do not indicate when infection had occurred. we presented a robust imaging procedure with a chest ct protocol for confident diagnosis of covid-19. the clinical course and viral detection period in mild or asymptomatic coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) patients are not yet known. a five-year-old girl with fever and headache was diagnosed with acute sars-cov-2-associated meningoencephalitis based on the detection of its rna on a nasopharyngeal swab, cerebrospinal fluid analysis, and magnetic resonance imaging findings. alternative methodologies to pcr and immunodiagnostics that would not require specific reagents are worthy to investigate not only for fighting the covid-19 pandemic but also to detect other emergent pathogenic threats. severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2) can be detected via a nasopharyngeal swab and in sputum, blood, urine, and feces. therefore, the development of a rapid and simple method for on-site detection of sars-cov is crucial for the identification and prevention of future sars outbreaks. |||",No
Can induction of labor prevent infant deaths in pregnancies that go beyond the estimated due date? Does it reduce the number of neonatal intensive care unit stays?,Yes,"The available evidence suggests that a policy of labour induction compared with expectant management is associated with fewer perinatal deaths. This finding is supported by a recent randomized controlled trial that reported early term induction of labor reduced cesarean section rates and infant morbidity. A policy of labour induction at 41 completed weeks or beyond was associated with fewer (all-cause) perinatal deaths compared with a policy of expectant management. Furthermore, fewer babies in the labour induction group had meconium aspiration syndrome compared with a policy of expectant management. However, the absolute risk of perinatal death is small, and the number needed to treat to benefit with induction of labour in order to prevent one perinatal death was 410. The evidence also suggests that induction of labor at or near term does not increase cesarean delivery. Although some infant morbidities such as meconium aspiration syndrome were reduced with a policy of post-term labour induction, no significant differences in the rate of neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission were seen.","a policy of labour induction compared with expectant management is associated with fewer perinatal deaths and fewer caesarean sections. a recent randomized controlled trial reported that early term induction of labor reduced cesarean section rates and infant morbidity. a policy of labour induction at 41 completed weeks or beyond was associated with fewer (all-cause) perinatal deaths (1/2986 versus 9/2953; relative risk (rr) 0.30; 95% confidence interval (ci) 0.09 to 0.99). a policy of labour induction after 41 completed weeks or later compared to awaiting spontaneous labour either indefinitely or at least one week is associated with fewer perinatal deaths. preliminary data indicate that labor induction for prolonged latent phase may reduce cesarean delivery. whether a policy of labour induction at a predetermined gestational age can reduce this increased risk is the subject of this review. whether a policy of labour induction at a predetermined gestational age can reduce this increased risk is the subject of this review. although women who had an early term labor induction with large-for-gestational age were less likely to have a cesarean section, the increased risk of neonatal morbidities and additional healthcare utilization suggests the need for caution in early induction of large-for-gestational age babies before 39 weeks' gestation. the number needed to treat to benefit (nntb) with induction of labour in order to prevent one perinatal death was 410 (95% ci 322 to 1492).for the primary outcome of perinatal death and most other outcomes, no differences between timing of induction subgroups were seen; the majority of trials adopted a policy of induction at 41 completed weeks (287 days) or more.fewer babies in the labour induction group had meconium aspiration syndrome (rr 0.50, 95% ci 0.34 to 0.73; eight trials, 2371 infants) compared with a policy of expectant management. prevention of premature labor and better care of the premature infant during labor and the neonatal period offer hope of a greater salvage of premature infants. although labor induction at 39 weeks of gestation has been shown to reduce the number of cesarean deliveries, compared with expectant management, without increasing neonatal morbidity in nulliparous, low-risk women, the association between induction at 39 weeks and longer-term childhood cognitive outcomes is not certain. induction of labor did not reduce cesarean delivery rates but intervention to delivery and to hospital discharge durations are shorter. some infant morbidities such as meconium aspiration syndrome were also reduced with a policy of post-term labour induction although no significant differences in the rate of nicu admission were seen.however, the absolute risk of perinatal death is small. the authors consider the evidence base for near-term induction of labor and cesarean for a range of scenarios. to assess the effect on fetal and infant survival of increased rates of early delivery of preeclamptic pregnancies. the trials were generally at moderate risk of bias.compared with a policy of expectant management, a policy of labour induction was associated with fewer (all-cause) perinatal deaths: risk ratio (rr) 0.31, 95% confidence interval (ci) 0.12 to 0.88; 17 trials, 7407 women. induction of labor compared with expectant management. in post-term pregnancy, the induction of labor results in a lower rate of cesarean section than serial antenatal monitoring; the rates of perinatal mortality and neonatal morbidity are similar with the two approaches to management. there is growing evidence from randomized trials that induction of labor at or near term does not increase cesarean delivery; observational data show that the optimal gestation for spontaneous delivery for the baby is 39 weeks. cesarean section appears to be associated with increased risk of neonatal mortality among infants of low-risk term pregnancies, but it may offer some survival advantage among the most extremely preterm infants. |||",Yes
Does induction of labor make cesarean sections less necessary than observational waiting?,Yes,"The claim that induction of labor makes cesarean sections less necessary than observational waiting is not supported by the evidence. Although some studies have found that induction of labor at 39 weeks in low-risk nulliparous women reduces the risk of cesarean delivery compared with expectant management, other studies have found that induction of labor is associated with a small increased risk of cesarean delivery. Inappropriate elective inductions of labor can put patients at increased risk of cesarean delivery, neonatal morbidity, and elevated cost. When using the correct comparison group (elective induction vs expectant management), induction is not associated with an increased risk of cesarean delivery. However, the evidence does not support the claim that induction of labor makes cesarean sections less necessary than observational waiting.","most observational studies found that non-medically indicated induction of labor (iol) is not associated with an increased risk of cesarean delivery compared with expectant management, defined as all births at a later gestation. although induction of labor of low-risk nulliparous women at 39 weeks reduces the risk of cesarean delivery compared with expectant management, concern regarding more frequent use of labor induction remains, given that this intervention historically has been thought to incur greater resource utilization. it is a commonly held belief that labor induction increases the risk of cesarean delivery; women who are induced are at higher risk of cesarean as compared with those in spontaneous labor. a recent systematic review found no ""good quality evidence"" that elective induction of labor confers substantial benefits to either mothers or babies, but concluded that elective induction is associated with a decreased risk of ""cesarean delivery."" using the proper comparison group, studies find that labor induction is actually associated with a small decreased risk of cesarean delivery. given the historically high rates of cesarean delivery in the united states, obstetrical providers must often consider an induction of labor for women with a history of prior cesarean delivery versus repeat cesarean delivery. preliminary data indicate that labor induction for prolonged latent phase may reduce cesarean delivery. to determine the risks and benefits of elective induction of labor (iol) at 39 weeks compared with expectant management (em) until 42 weeks in pregnancies complicated by one previous cesarean delivery. women randomized to induction of labor had longer durations in labor and delivery but significantly fewer antepartum visits, tests, and treatments and shorter maternal and neonatal hospital durations after delivery. in pregnancies complicated by one previous cesarean delivery, elective induction of labor at 39 weeks reduced the risk of intra-amniotic infection, blood transfusion, and low 5-minute apgar score while increased the risk of repeat cesarean delivery. this review discusses the observational and randomized data that have informed this debate, focusing on recent studies that have reshaped how we think about elective labor induction at 39 weeks of gestation. inappropriate elective inductions of labor put patients at increased risk of cesarean, neonatal morbidity, and elevated cost. induction of labor did not reduce cesarean delivery rates but intervention to delivery and to hospital discharge durations are shorter. perinatal outcomes of pregnancies electively induced at 39 weeks (iol) were compared to pregnancies that were induced, augmented or underwent spontaneous labor between 40 and 42 weeks (em). the objective of the study was to determine whether planned elective labor induction at 39 weeks among low-risk nulliparous women, compared with expectant management, was associated with differences in health care resource utilization from the time of randomization through 8 weeks postpartum. the role of labor induction in patients scheduled for vaginal delivery following a previous lower segment cesarean section has been controversial. during the delivery admission, women in the induction of labor group spent a longer time in labor and delivery (median, 0.83 vs 0.57 days), but both women (p = .002) and their neonates (p < .001) had shorter postpartum stays. labor induction is associated with increased cesarean risk whether using a week-to-week comparison group or an expectant group that includes women the same week or beyond that of the index induction, even after adjustment for parity, high-risk factors, and demographic variables. when using the correct comparison group (elective induction vs expectant management) induction is not associated with an increased risk of cesarean delivery. our goal was to evaluate whether active management of labor lowers cesarean section rates, shortens the length of labor, and overcomes any negative effects of epidural analgesia on nulliparous labor. |||",Yes
Does the number of deliveries with a vacuum cup and forceps remain similar with induction and observational waiting???,Yes,"The number of deliveries with a vacuum cup and forceps does not remain similar with induction and observational waiting. The rate of vacuum-assisted deliveries has increased compared to forceps application in the last decade. This is likely due to the vacuum extractor being associated with less maternal morbidity and comparable neonatal problems, while forceps delivery has a lower failure rate. However, the pliable cup used in vacuum-assisted deliveries detaches significantly more often than the rigid cup, leading to a higher rate of failed deliveries. Additionally, there is a relationship between unfavorable cup application during vacuum-assisted delivery and neonatal scalp trauma in infants born to nulliparous women. Therefore, the choice of delivery method depends on various factors, including the mother's and infant's health, the position of the fetus, and the experience of the healthcare provider.","because of the faster induction of vacuum, delivery occurred more rapidly with the pliable cup, but the pliable cup detached significantly more often than the rigid cup. the rate of neonates with apgar scores<or=at 1 min was significantly higher after forceps compared with vacuum delivery (18% vs 5.2% respectively, p=0.0003). the aim of the present study is to compare the short term maternal and neonatal outcomes between vacuum and forceps delivery. the incidence of 3rd degree lacerations and periurethral hematomas was similar between vacuum and forceps (3.4% vs. 2% and 0.3% vs 0% respectively), while perineal hematomas were more common in forceps compared with vacuum application (2% vs 0.3% respectively), albeit not significantly. we conducted a prospective observational study of 1000 consecutive vacuum-assisted deliveries using the omnicup vacuum device in singleton pregnancies. whilst the use of the vacuum extractor was associated with less maternal morbidity (54.9% episiotomy rate; 20.9% nil analgesia) and comparable neonatal problems, an increased failure rate (6.5%) was demonstrated in comparison to forceps delivery (0.7% failed vaginal delivery rate). the rate of operative vaginal delivery has remained stable the last decade, however the rate of vacuum has increased against forceps application. to determine whether two techniques of vacuum extraction delivery-continuous vacuum and intermittent vacuum-have different effects on maternal-fetal outcomes. in this prospective study 44 women undergoing elective repeat cesarean were randomized to deliver by vacuum (v), forceps (f), or by manual (m) means. it is concluded that the vacuum extractor is a comparable instrument for midcavity or lift-out instrumental delivery but kielland's forceps may still be a more appropriate instrument for rotational vaginal delivery. a total of 258 women requiring assisted delivery where vacuum extraction was thought to be suitable were randomly allocated to delivery with a new silicone rubber cup or metal vacuum extractor cups. we sought to ascertain whether the routine use of instruments, forceps or vacuum, at the time of elective repeat cesarean delivery, permits a delivery that is as safe for mother and infant and as easy for mother and physician as traditional manual delivery of the fetal head. there is a relationship between unfavourable cup application during vacuum assisted delivery and neonatal scalp trauma in infants born to nulliparous women. to compare the effectiveness and complications of vacuum extraction delivery between the conventional metal cup and the silicone rubber cup. out of 7098 deliveries, 374 were instrument assisted, 324 were conducted by vacuum (86.7%) and 50 by forceps (13.3%). term inductions were less likely to have a subsequent sptb compared with term spontaneous labor (6% vs 11%; odds ratio [or], 0.49; 95% confidence interval, 0.29-0.81; p = .005). in 87.1% of the women, vacuum-assisted delivery was completed; spontaneous or forceps delivery occurred in 10.9%, and caesarean section was performed in 2%. a retrospective analysis over a 2-year period was carried out to compare the limitations in the use of the silastic cup vacuum extractor and forceps as the preferred instrument for operative vaginal delivery. vacuum-assisted delivery was attempted in 555 women. reviews of observational studies generally report an increase in the rate of caesarean section, whereas reviews of post-dates and term prelabour rupture of membrane (prom trials suggest either no difference or a reduction in risk. |||",Yes
"Does taking supplements with omega-3 fatty acids reduce the risk of heart attack, stroke or other sudden cardiovascular problems?  Does it lower the risk of dying prematurely?",No,"The context suggests that dietary supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids significantly reduces the risk of cardiovascular deaths, sudden cardiac death, all-cause mortality, and nonfatal cardiovascular events. The reduction in risk is attributed to the prevention of fatal arrhythmias and the positive effects of omega-3 fatty acids on the cardiovascular system, including heart rate reduction. Observational and clinical trial evidence indicates an inverse association between omega-3 fatty acid intake and the risk of cardiovascular disease development/mortality and sudden cardiac death. The detailed mechanisms remain to be elucidated, but high intake of n-3 fatty acids is associated with reduced mortality in patients with ischemic heart disease, especially sudden cardiac death. Therefore, the context supports the claim that taking supplements with omega-3 fatty acids reduces the risk of heart attack, stroke, or other sudden cardiovascular problems and lowers the risk of dying prematurely.","dietary supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids significantly reduced the risk of cardiovascular deaths (odds ratio [or]: 0.87, 95% confidence interval [ci]: 0.79-0.95, p = 0.002), sudden cardiac death (or: 0.87, 95% ci: 0.76-0.99, p = 0.04), all-cause mortality (or: 0.92, 95% ci: 0.85-0.99, p = 0.02), and nonfatal cardiovascular events (or: 0.92, 95% ci: 0.85-0.99, p = 0.02). supplementation of omega-3 fatty acids (ω-3) has been associated with a decreased cardiovascular risk, thereby concentrating attention on a potentially preventive effect regarding tachyarrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. more recent data, however, suggest that, in some patients with heart disease, omega-3 fatty acid supplementation may increase the risk of potentially fatal cardiac arrhythmias and the risk of sudden cardiac death. initial epidemiological, clinical trial and animal data have suggested that a diet high in omega-3 fatty acids reduces the risk of cardiac death and that this reduction in the risk was owing to the prevention of fatal arrhythmias. omega-3 fatty acid supplementation reduces the risk of sudden cardiac death and death from any cause within 4 months in post-myocardial infarction patients. omega-3 fatty acid supplement use was independently associated with a lower risk of non-fatal ischemic stroke [hr (95% ci): 0.88 (0.81, 0.95)] but not non-fatal cad [0.99 (0.93, 1.06)]. current evidence suggests that individuals with coronary artery disease may reduce their risk of sudden cardiac death by increasing their intake of long-chain omega-3 fatty acids by approximately 1 g per day. consumption of omega-3 fatty acids (fas) is associated with a reduction in deaths from coronary heart disease, arrhythmia, and sudden death. n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (omega-3) supplementation is associated with reduced cardiovascular mortality and post-infarction death. it is well recognized that omega-3 fas exert positive effects on the cardiovascular system including heart rate (hr) reduction, a major risk factor to sudden death. dietary supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids should be considered in the secondary prevention of cardiovascular events. observational and clinical trial evidence suggests an inverse association of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids with coronary artery disease (cad) mortality, although relationships with non-fatal cad and stroke are less clear. an inverse relation exists between omega-3 fatty acid intake and risk of cardiovascular disease development/mortality and sudden cardiac death in humans. although high intake of n-3 fatty acids is associated with reduced mortality of patients with ischemic heart disease, especially reduction in sudden cardiac death (scd), the detailed mechanisms remain to be elucidated. epidemiologic data suggest that omega-3 fatty acids derived from fish oil reduce cardiovascular disease. consumption of n-3 fatty acids reduces the incidence of cardiovascular mortality in populations that consume diets rich in fish oil. of all known dietary factors, long-chain omega-3 fatty acids may be the most protective against death from coronary heart disease. very-long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (omega-3 pufas) from fish are thought to reduce risk of sudden death, possibly by reducing susceptibility to cardiac arrhythmia. we investigated whether omega-3 fatty acid supplement use and fish intake were associated with incident non-fatal cad and ischemic stroke among us veterans. while omega-3 supplement use was associated with lower risk of non-fatal ischemic stroke, fish intake was not. |||",No
"Can taking dietary supplements with omega-3 fatty acids prevent further heart attacks or strokes if one has already had a heart attack?  In this case, does it lower the risk of dying prematurely??",No,"Several epidemiological and clinical studies have shown that dietary supplementation of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (omega-3 PUFAs) can reduce the risk of sudden death following a myocardial infarction. Current evidence suggests that individuals with coronary artery disease may reduce their risk of sudden cardiac death by increasing their intake of long-chain omega-3 fatty acids by approximately 1 g per day. The cardioprotective effects of omega-3 fatty acids have been documented in epidemiologic and randomized controlled trials, and they appear to be beneficial in secondary prevention of cardiovascular events. The mechanisms through which omega-3 fatty acids might confer cardiac benefits over and above the standard secondary prevention strategies include reducing heart rate, a major risk factor for sudden death, and increasing vagal activity. However, the detailed mechanisms remain to be elucidated. It is important to note that while omega-3 fatty acids may have cardioprotective effects, they should not be used as a substitute for standard medical treatment and lifestyle modifications.","more recent data, however, suggest that, in some patients with heart disease, omega-3 fatty acid supplementation may increase the risk of potentially fatal cardiac arrhythmias and the risk of sudden cardiac death. we explored possible mechanisms by which recommended intakes of omega-3 fatty acids may decrease the risk for sudden cardiac death in patients with documented coronary heart disease. several epidemiologic and clinical studies show that following myocardial infarction, dietary supplements of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (omega3fa) reduce sudden death. current evidence suggests that individuals with coronary artery disease may reduce their risk of sudden cardiac death by increasing their intake of long-chain omega-3 fatty acids by approximately 1 g per day. supplementation of omega-3 fatty acids (ω-3) has been associated with a decreased cardiovascular risk, thereby concentrating attention on a potentially preventive effect regarding tachyarrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. initial epidemiological, clinical trial and animal data have suggested that a diet high in omega-3 fatty acids reduces the risk of cardiac death and that this reduction in the risk was owing to the prevention of fatal arrhythmias. omega-3 fatty acid supplementation reduces the risk of sudden cardiac death and death from any cause within 4 months in post-myocardial infarction patients. this article briefly reviews the evidence regarding omega-3 fatty acids and chd and outlines the mechanisms through which omega-3 fatty acids might confer cardiac benefits over and above the standard secondary prevention strategies. omega-3 fatty acids from fish and fish oils can protect against coronary heart disease (chd), which is still the most common cause of death in the western economies. an inverse relation exists between omega-3 fatty acid intake and risk of cardiovascular disease development/mortality and sudden cardiac death in humans. although high intake of n-3 fatty acids is associated with reduced mortality of patients with ischemic heart disease, especially reduction in sudden cardiac death (scd), the detailed mechanisms remain to be elucidated. it is well recognized that omega-3 fas exert positive effects on the cardiovascular system including heart rate (hr) reduction, a major risk factor to sudden death. the conclusion reached is that omega-3 fatty acids play a significant role in secondary prevention post-myocardial infarction. evidence from epidemiological and case cohort studies indicate that consumpton of fatty fish and omega-3 fatty acids reduces the risk of cardiovascular mortality. of all known dietary factors, long-chain omega-3 fatty acids may be the most protective against death from coronary heart disease. since cardiovascular dysfunction may contribute to sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (sudep), the consumption of omega-3 fatty acids (omega-3 fas) might be beneficial as an adjunctive therapy for sudep prevention. clinical studies suggest that intake of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (omega-3 pufa) may lower the incidence of heart failure. the cardioprotective effects of omega-3 fatty acids have been documented in epidemiologic and randomized controlled trials. n-3 fatty acids appear to be beneficial in secondary prevention of cardiovascular events but their use in primary prevention is not clear. these changes are consistent with an increase in vagal activity and may in part explain the observed decrease in risk for sudden cardiac death seen with omega-3 fatty acid supplementation. |||",No
Is music therapy with rhythmic training helpful for people with Parkinson's who have trouble walking?,Yes,"Justification: Recent evidence suggests that music-based movement (mbm) therapy may be a promising intervention to improve gait and gait-related activities in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. Entrainment of walking to rhythmic auditory cues, such as music, has been shown to improve gait in people with PD. Additionally, rhythmic auditory stimulation (RAS) can influence movement during straight line walking and direction transition in individuals with PD. Music therapy and other music and rhythm-based interventions may offer a range of symptomatic benefits to patients with PD and other movement disorders. Recent behavioral data has shown beneficial effects of musically cued gait training (mcgt) on gait performance, perceptual timing, and sensorimotor timing abilities in PD patients. Walking while mentally singing has potential for improving the gait of individuals with PD.","music listening interventions such as rhythmic auditory stimulation can improve mobility, balance, and gait in parkinson&rsquo;s disease (pd). this review highlights the findings of recent studies utilizing music and rhythm-based interventions for gait impairment, other motor symptoms, and non-motor symptoms in parkinson disease (pd) and other movement disorders. recent evidence suggests that music-based movement (mbm) therapy may be a promising intervention to improve gait and gait-related activities in parkinson's disease (pd) patients, because it naturally combines cognitive movement strategies, cueing techniques, balance exercises and physical activity while focussing on the enjoyment of moving on music instead of the current mobility limitations of the patient. entrainment of walking to rhythmic auditory cues (e.g., metronome and/or music) improves gait in people with parkinson's disease (pd). gait dysfunctions in parkinson's disease can be partly relieved by rhythmic auditory cueing. the rehabilitation in parkinson's disease: strategies for cueing (rescue) trial investigated the effects of a home physiotherapy programme based on rhythmical cueing on gait and gait-related activity. recent works have proved that parkinson's disease (pd) patients can be largely benefit by performing rehabilitation exercises based on audio cueing and music therapy. rhythmic auditory stimulation (ras) can influence movement during straight line walking and direction transition in individuals with parkinson disease (pd). despite impaired audiomotor synchronization, pd patients' gait improves when they walk with an auditory metronome or with music. purpose: rhythmic auditory stimulation such as listening to music can alleviate gait bradykinesia in people with parkinson disease (pd) by increasing spatiotemporal gait features. music therapy and other music and rhythm-based interventions may offer a range of symptomatic benefits to patients with pd and other movement disorders. in this study, patients suffering from mild to moderate pd underwent a structured music therapy session in which they were trained to walk while mentally singing. slowed gait in patients with parkinson's disease (pd) can be improved when patients synchronize footsteps to isochronous metronome cues, but limited retention of such improvements suggest that permanent cueing regimes are needed for long-term improvements. movement rehabilitation by means of physical therapy represents an essential tool in the management of gait disturbances induced by parkinson's disease (pd). this review and rationale provides support for the use of music training to enhance cognitive outcomes in patients with parkinson&rsquo;s disease (pd). in keeping with this idea, we report here recent behavioral data showing beneficial effects of musically cued gait training (mcgt) on gait performance (i.e., increased stride length and speed), perceptual timing (e.g., discriminating stimulus durations), and sensorimotor timing abilities (i.e., in paced tapping tasks) in pd patients. cueing training may be a useful therapeutic adjunct to the overall management of gait disturbance in parkinson's disease. thus, walking while mentally singing has potential for improving the gait of individuals with pd. background: music-assisted treadmill training (matt) is a new therapeutic approach for parkinson's disease (pd) patients, combining treadmill training with rhythmic auditory cueing and visual feedback. our findings suggest that tdcs may be a useful adjunct to gait rehabilitation for patients with pd, although studies in a larger group of patients are needed to evaluate the therapeutic use of non-invasive brain stimulation during dance therapy. |||",Yes
Do preparations with unsaponifiable components of avocado and soybean oils (ASU) help against limitations and pain in osteoarthritis of the knee joint?,Yes,"The context suggests that preparations with unsaponifiable components of avocado and soybean oils (ASU) have been shown to have beneficial effects in the treatment of osteoarthritis (OA).

Can taking chondroitin relieve osteoarthritis pain or improve mobility in the long term?,No,"The context suggests that chondroitin sulfate has been shown to relieve pain and improve functional limitation in patients with osteoarthritis of the knee in numerous clinical trials and meta-analyses. Chondroitin sulfate is referred to as a symptomatic slow-acting drug for osteoarthritis because it improves articular function, reduces joint swelling and effusion, and may have a role as a structure-modifying agent in the management of patients with knee osteoarthritis. The preparations applied in the treatment of degenerative joint disease, containing chondroitin sulfate, are attributed numerous therapeutic and chondroprotective properties including stabilizing synthesis processes and cartilage degradation, an increased proteoglycan and hyaluronic acid biosynthesis, and a decreased collagen II degradation.

Do air purifiers help relieve symptoms of allergic asthma?,No,"The use of air purifiers, specifically HEPA air purifiers, has been shown to effectively reduce particulate matter and house dust mite allergen concentration in indoor air. This reduction in allergen exposure can lead to improvement in clinical manifestations of patients with allergic rhinitis. Furthermore, air purifiers have been recommended by clinicians for patients with allergic rhinitis, and have been shown to be effective in removing pollen from homes, thereby decreasing the risk of symptoms. In asthmatic patients, airway hyperresponsiveness and allergic inflammatory changes are regarded as the primary manifestations of the disease. The main goals of asthma treatment are to decrease inflammation and maximize bronchodilation. The use of air purifiers can contribute to this by reducing allergen exposure and improving airway hyperresponsiveness. Therefore, it can be concluded that air purifiers can help relieve symptoms of allergic asthma.","this research aims at evaluating the ability of air purifiers to be a therapy of allergic rhinitis. in combination with other allergen avoidance measures, the examined air-cleaners can contribute to diminished allergen exposure and improvement of airway hyperresponsiveness in asthmatic patients. air purifiers have been recommended by clinicians for ar patients, but few studies have focused on the removal of airborne allergens from home environments. hepa air purifiers can effectively reduce pm and hdm allergen concentration in the indoor air, and thereby improve clinical manifestations of patients with ar. ar patients can remove pollen from their homes using air purifiers, decreasing the risk of symptoms. air purification can reduce concentrations of particles in indoor air, including those of allergens. the purpose of this study was to test recently developed air-cleaners with respect to their capacity to capture airborne allergen particles and to improve clinical parameters of asthmatic patients sensitized to aeroallergens. 32 subjects (25±13.5 years old) diagnosed with allergic rhinitis were selected and hepa air purifiers placed in their bedrooms for 4 months. this study investigates the efficacy of a high-efficiency air purifier in reducing disease activity in the homes of ar patients sensitive to the allergens produced by artemisia (mugwort) pollen. in asthma, adrenergic agonists alleviate airflow obstruction and prevent obstructive responses to a variety of stimuli. since the 1950s, corticosteroid aerosols have proved useful in the treatment of asthma. inhaled adenosine receptor agonists induce bronchoconstriction and inflammation in asthma and are used as bronchial challenge agents for the diagnosis of asthma and in respiratory drug development. since airway hyperresponsiveness (ahr) and allergic inflammatory changes are regarded as the primary manifestations of asthma, the main goals of asthma treatment are to decrease inflammation and maximize bronchodilation. inhalation of allergens by sensitized patients with asthma induces reversible airway obstruction, airway hyperresponsiveness, and eosinophilic airway inflammation. attenuation of allergen-induced bronchoconstriction and inflammation has been used to examine the efficacy of therapeutic agents such as inhaled corticosteroids in asthma. inhalation therapy with bronchodilators (relievers) and anti-inflammatory agents (controllers) forms the basis of treatment for most patients with asthma of different severities. recommendations for allergen avoidance or allergen reduction measures play an important part in the treatment of allergic asthmatic patients. these findings collectively indicate that nebulized ketamine attenuated many of the central components of inflammatory changes and ahr in ova-provoked experimental asthma, potentially providing a new therapeutic approach against asthma. background: asthma is a common chronic airway disease associated with hyperresponsiveness and airway inflammation. in asthmatic patients, airflow limitation is at least partly reversed by administration of pharmacological bronchodilators, typically β2 -adrenoceptor agonists. |||",No

"Can vitamin D supplements prevent colds, flu, colds, and other viral respiratory illnesses when there is no or only a mild deficiency of vitamin D?",No,"The evidence suggests that vitamin D supplementation may provide significant benefit in preventing respiratory viral infections, particularly in individuals with deficient levels of vitamin D. However, the data does not support the routine use of high-dose vitamin D supplementation in children for the prevention of viral upper respiratory tract infections when there is no or only a mild deficiency of vitamin D. Furthermore, the mechanisms by which vitamin D affects viral pattern recognition receptor (PRR)-driven cytokine production are not well understood. Therefore, it is not recommended to use vitamin D supplements for the prevention of colds, flu, colds, and other viral respiratory illnesses when there is no or only a mild deficiency of vitamin D.","here we review the in vitro data on the role of vitamin d in antiviral innate immunity, the data concerning the deficient levels of vitamin d in lung diseases, and the in vivo role of supplementation as protection against respiratory viral infections in healthy individuals and in patients with chronic respiratory diseases. patients with respiratory disease are frequently deficient in vitamin d, implying that supplementation might provide significant benefit to these patients. higher vitamin d concentrations have been proposed as a protective 'seasonal stimulus' against influenza, and there are suggestions for associations with other aspects of respiratory health. interventional and observational epidemiological studies provide evidence that vitamin d deficiency may confer increased risk of influenza and respiratory tract infection. finally, we suggest ways of improving the effectiveness of vitamin d as an adjuvant in the prevention and treatment of acute respiratory infections. to determine whether high-dose vs standard-dose vitamin d supplementation reduces the incidence of wintertime upper respiratory tract infections in young children. vitamin d, acting through this receptor, may be important in protection against respiratory infections. clinical trials have found that prophylactic vitamin d supplementation decreases the risk of developing pneumonia in children. some studies have hypothesized that vitamin d may have a role to play in protection against influenza virus infections and illnesses, and that seasonal fluctuation in serum 25-hydroxyvitamin d [25(oh)d] may affect seasonal patterns of influenza virus infections. in conclusion, vitamin d status had a linear relationship with respiratory infections and lung function. these findings indicate that lower serum vitamin d concentrations may not contribute to the seasonality of influenza and are not associated with an increased risk of influenza virus infections in persons of all ages in hong kong. among healthy children aged 1 to 5 years, daily administration of 2000 iu compared with 400 iu of vitamin d supplementation did not reduce overall wintertime upper respiratory tract infections. the aim of the present study was to investigate the relationship of current vitamin d status (measured by 25-hydroxyvitamin d, 25(oh)d) with respiratory infections and lung function. although epidemiologic studies link poor in vivo 25(oh)d status to increased viral respiratory infections, we poorly understand how vitamin d affects viral pattern recognition receptor (prr)-driven cytokine production. these findings do not support the routine use of high-dose vitamin d supplementation in children for the prevention of viral upper respiratory tract infections. observational studies conclusively show that a low vitamin d status is associated with an increased occurrence of respiratory viral infections, which globally represent significant health and financial burdens. when vitamin d is deficient, it can cause a series of related diseases, such as respiratory tract infection. children with acute pneumonia may be vitamin d deficient. epidemiological studies support a link between low 25-hydroxyvitamin d levels and a higher risk of viral upper respiratory tract infections. thus far, vitamin d has not been found to enhance the immune response to vaccines. |||",No

Does going to the sauna several times a week prolong men's lives?,Yes,"The context suggests that regular sauna bathing may improve cardiovascular function, reduce the risk of various diseases, and enhance endurance performance. These factors could potentially contribute to prolonging men's lives. However, the direct impact of sauna bathing on lifespan is not explicitly stated and would require further research to establish a definitive link.","the large use of finnish sauna in nordic countries and its growing use in other parts of the world make it important to consider the impact of this lifestyle choice on men's fertility. sixteen male subjects (20-23 years) were subjected to 10 sauna bathing sessions in a finnish sauna every 1 or 2 days. our data demonstrated for the first time that in normozoospermic subjects, sauna exposure induces a significant but reversible impairment of spermatogenesis, including alteration of sperm parameters, mitochondrial function and sperm dna packaging. of the rand-36 domains physical function, vitality, social functioning, and general health were significantly better among sauna users than non-users. analysis of well-being scores after stratifying respondents into three groups by sauna-bathing frequency (group i: <5 times per month; group ii: 5-15 times per month; group iii: >15 times per month) revealed group ii respondents had slightly higher mental well-being scores (kruskal-wallis testing: h = 6.603 > ꭔ2 of 5.991, p = 0.0368, df = 2 with post hoc analysis using mann-whitney u test: p = 0.016) as compared to respondents who were sauna-bathing less frequently (group i). at the end of sauna exposure, we found a strong impairment of sperm count and motility (p < 0.001), while no significant change in sex hormones was present. a statistically significant decrease of total cholesterol and ldl cholesterol was observed during 3 weeks of sauna treatment and in the week afterwards. it has been postulated that regular sauna bathing may improve cardiovascular function via improved endothelium-dependent dilatation, reduced arterial stiffness, modulation of the autonomic nervous system, beneficial changes in circulating lipid profiles, and lowering of systemic blood pressure. regular sauna bathing was common among octogenarian men and was associated with better hrqol. emerging evidence suggests that beyond its use for pleasure, sauna bathing may be linked to several health benefits, which include reduction in the risk of vascular diseases such as high blood pressure, cardiovascular disease, and neurocognitive diseases; nonvascular conditions such as pulmonary diseases; mortality; as well as amelioration of conditions such as arthritis, headache, and flu. this cross-sectional study documents that sauna-bathing participants, particularly those from finland, australia and the united states, are motivated to use saunas predominantly for relaxation, reporting health benefits especially around mental well-being and sleep, with relatively few adverse effects. peripheral epc numbers exhibited a moderate increase following finnish sauna in a cohort of healthy young men. the physiological adaptations to sauna bathing could enhance endurance performance. an overview of the postulated biological mechanisms underlying the associations between sauna bathing and its health benefits, areas of outstanding uncertainty, and implications for clinical practice is also provided. what are the effects of continuous sauna exposure on seminal parameters, sperm chromatin, sperm apoptosis and expression of genes involved in heat stress and hypoxia? the beneficial effects of sauna bathing on these outcomes have been linked to its effect on circulatory, cardiovascular, and immune functions. besides studies in general medicine evaluating the health benefit of sauna, e.g. top finnish athletes have discovered this, taking a sauna almost twice a week. repeated heat exposure like sauna bathing is suggested to beneficially affect against dementia development. relative to control, sauna bathing increased run time to exhaustion by 32% (90% confidence limits 21-43%), which is equivalent to an enhancement of approximately 1.9% (1.3-2.4%) in an endurance time trial. |||",Yes
Does the additional offer of HIV self-testing cause more people to take an HIV test?,Yes,"Justification: The context suggests that the availability of HIV self-testing has the potential to increase the uptake of HIV testing services, particularly among those who may not otherwise test. This is supported by evidence from public pilot programs in sub-Saharan Africa showing high acceptability and feasibility of self-testing. Additionally, the context indicates that among Malawian adults offered HIV self-testing, optional home initiation of care compared with standard HIV care resulted in a significant increase in the proportion of adults initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART). This suggests that the additional offer of HIV self-testing may indeed cause more people to take an HIV test.","self-tests for hiv may increase awareness of infection among men who have sex with men (msm). to investigate whether offering optional home initiation of hiv care after hiv self-testing might increase demand for art initiation, compared with hiv self-testing accompanied by facility-based services only. to evaluate the effect of providing hiv self-tests on frequency of testing, diagnoses of hiv infection, and sexual risk behaviors. self-testing for hiv infection may contribute to early diagnosis of hiv, but without necessarily increasing antiretroviral therapy (art) initiation. this paper reviews recent research on the acceptability, feasibility, and cost of rapid testing and home-specimen collection for hiv, and suggests that self-testing may be another important strategy for diagnosing hiv infection. with approval of an hiv self-test kit in the usa, increasing evidence from public pilot programs in sub-saharan africa showing high acceptability and feasibility, and evidence of the informal sale of rapid hiv test kits in the private sector, options for individuals to access hiv self-testing, as well as consumer-demand, appear to be increasing. distribution of hiv self-tests provides a worthwhile mechanism to increase awareness of hiv infection and prevent transmission among msm. with better health care and greater access to antiretrovirals (arvs) it has become important to increase the uptake of hiv testing. participants who preferred self-testing for hiv were predominantly (p < 0.05) male, white, lived in cities or towns, did not know their hiv status, and had no intention of being tested at a medical facility in future. significantly (p = <0.0001) more persons that self-tested positive (39/44, 89%) than persons that self-tested negative (14/36, 39%) sought laboratory-based hiv test within 1 month of last self-testing; and negative than positive self-tested persons were diagnosed with acute hiv infection (44% vs. 9%, p = <0.0001). participants indicated that they would consider testing if self-testing for hiv with telephone counselling becomes readily available in their communities. the rapid human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) self-test in the united states has expanded opportunities for hiv testing in nonclinical settings which may increase early diagnosis of hiv infection. rapid hiv testing in high-risk populations can increase the number of persons who learn their hiv status and avoid spending clinic resources to locate persons identified as hiv infected. availability of over-the-counter rapid hiv tests could improve access to testing those reluctant or unable to use current services. hiv self-testing (hivst) is an additional approach to increasing uptake of hiv testing services. such increases, particularly among those at risk who may not otherwise test, will likely identify more hiv-positive individuals as compared to standard testing services alone. among malawian adults offered hiv self-testing, optional home initiation of care compared with standard hiv care resulted in a significant increase in the proportion of adults initiating art. self-testing has the potential to be an innovative component to community-wide hiv-prevention strategies. more recently who and unaids have explored self-testing as an option to achieving greater hiv testing coverage to support global treatment targets. self-testing has untapped potential as a strategy to improve access to hiv testing and to increase testing frequency. |||",Yes
Does healing clay with the clay mineral smectite help when children have diarrhea?,Yes,"Based on the available evidence, smectite, a medicinal clay, may offer a complementary intervention to reduce the duration of diarrhea in children with acute infectious diarrhea. The natural clay dioctahedral smectite increases intestinal barrier function and is effective against infectious diarrhea in children. Smectite used as an adjuvant to rehydration therapy may reduce the duration of diarrhea in children with acute infectious diarrhea by a day, increase cure rate by day 3, and reduce stool output. However, it has no effect on hospitalization rates or need for intravenous therapy. The administration of smectite was associated with a significant reduction of the duration of diarrhea, as judged by stool frequency and consistency. Smectite reduces the duration of diarrhea and prevents a prolonged course. Patients in the smectite group had a significantly shorter duration of diarrhea and significantly fewer stools. Diosmectite significantly decreased stool output in children with acute watery diarrhea, especially those who were rotavirus-positive. Smectite was safe and well tolerated, and had no impact on the adsorption of electrolytes.","the natural clay dioctahedral smectite (smecta) increases intestinal barrier function and is effective against infectious diarrhoea in children. smectite, a medicinal clay, could offer a complementary intervention to reduce the duration of diarrhoea. the natural clay dioctahedral smectite increases intestinal barrier function and is effective against infectious diarrhea in children in developing countries. to assess the effects of smectite for treating acute infectious diarrhoea in children. the purpose of this work was to investigate the efficacy of smectite in italian children with acute diarrhea of mild to moderate severity. diosmectite is a clay used to treat children with acute watery diarrhea. dioctahedral smectite (ds) a natural adsorbent clay capable of adsorbing viruses, bacteria, and other intestinal irritants in vitro, is claimed to possess beneficial ""antidiarrheal"" properties. based on low-certainty evidence, smectite used as an adjuvant to rehydration therapy may reduce the duration of diarrhoea in children with acute infectious diarrhoea by a day; may increase cure rate by day 3; and may reduce stool output, but has no effect on hospitalization rates or need for intravenous therapy. administration of smectite was associated with significant reduction of the duration of diarrhea, as judged by stool frequency and consistency. randomized and quasi-randomized trials comparing smectite to a control group in children aged one month to 18 years old with acute infectious diarrhoea. most studies included children with rotavirus infections, and half included breastfed children.smectite may reduce the duration of diarrhoea by approximately a day (md -24.38 hours, 95% ci -30.91 to -17.85; 14 studies; 2209 children; low-certainty evidence); may increase clinical resolution at day 3 (risk ratio (rr) 2.10, 95% ci 1.30 to 3.39; 5 trials; 312 children; low-certainty evidence); and may reduce stool output (md -11.37, 95% ci -21.94 to -0.79; 3 studies; 634 children; low-certainty evidence).we are uncertain whether smectite reduces stool frequency, measured as depositions per day (md -1.33, 95% ci -2.28 to -0.38; 3 studies; 954 children; very low-certainty evidence). smectite reduces the duration of diarrhea and prevents a prolonged course. patients in the smectite group had a significantly shorter duration of diarrhea (mean +/- sd, 54 +/- 16 vs. 73 +/- 13 h) and significantly fewer stools (2.6 +/- 0.8 vs. 3 +/- 0.7 on second day; 1.9 +/- 0.7 vs. 2.4 +/- 0.7 on third day; and 11.3 +/- 3.2 vs. 13.8 +/- 3 overall). the purpose of this work was to compare the efficacy and tolerance of lithuanian children's diarrhoea treatment with dioctahedral smectite combined with hypotonic oral rehydration solution (ors)--gastrolit--versus gastrolit alone to establish the influence of smecta on serum electrolyte balance in young children with diarrhoea and mild or moderate dehydration. the present review describes the double beneficial effect of using clays for purposes of health and human nutrition: first, their chemical composition, which can enable the release of trace elements; and second, their mineralogical composition, which allows them to be used in the treatment of digestive diseases. we assessed the efficacy of a natural clay (smectite) on the frequency and the duration of acid (ph less than 4) and very acid (ph less than 3) gastroesophageal reflux (ger) measured by 24-hour continuous ph recording (cpr). effectiveness of clay against skin problems has been linked to its mineral composition and to microbial activity. these results show that diosmectite significantly decreased stool output in children with acute watery diarrhea, especially those who were rotavirus-positive. children seen by pediatricians for acute gastroenteritis were treated with oral rehydration solution (ors) alone or ors with smectite. smecta significantly reduced the duration of diarrhoea, was safe and well tolerated, and had no impact on the adsorption of electrolytes. |||",Yes
"Does a herbal combination preparation of rosemary, lovage, and centaury effectively relieve symptoms of uncomplicated cystitis?",Yes,"The context does not provide information on the effectiveness of a herbal combination preparation of rosemary, lovage, and centaury in relieving symptoms of uncomplicated cystitis. While it discusses the use of rosemary in pain management and its potential therapeutic effects in combination with analgesic drugs, it does not mention the specific combination of herbs in question or its efficacy in treating cystitis. Therefore, there is not enough information to make a definitive conclusion.","our findings support the use of rosemary in the management of pain and indicate a therapeutic potential of rosemary essential oil in combination with analgesic drugs. in traditional medicine, rosemary was used as mild analgesic, for relieving renal colic pain and dysmenorrhea. previously reported results of a prospective, randomized placebo-controlled study showed that the pollen extract (cernilton) significantly improved total symptoms, pain, and quality of life in patients with inflammatory prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (cp/cpps) without severe side effects. to evaluate the effectiveness of a phytotherapeutic intervention comprising a combination of hypericum perforatum (st. john's wort) and vitex agnus-castus (chaste tree/berry) in the management of menopausal symptoms. rosmarinus officinalis l., rosemary, is traditionally used to treat headache and improve cardiovascular disease partly due to its vasorelaxant activity, while the vasorelaxant ingredients remain unclear. this study examined which of the herbal infusions used in treatment and reduction of symptoms of utis have the greatest efficacy, and at which concentration levels (5.85 mg/ml; 0.59 mg/ml; 0.29 mg/ml). rosmarinus officinalis l. (lamiaceae), popularly known as rosemary, is used for food flavoring and in folk medicine as an antispasmodic, analgesic, antirheumatic, diuretic, and antiepileptic agent. this result suggests that rosemary extract may present an anti-implantation effect without interfering with the normal development of the concept after implantation. the mechanisms involved in analgesic effects of rosemary essential oil and the potential influence on cytochromes and drug metabolism should be more in-depth investigated. extracts of rosemary, rosmarinus officinalis l., have been used in folk medicine as a diuretic, an emenagogue, an antispasmodic and its aqueous extract does not present toxicity to man, presenting, however, abortive effects. the herbal combination of h. perforatum and v. agnus-castus was not found to be superior to placebo for the treatment of menopausal symptoms. we reviewed the current body of evidence supporting the use of echinacea to reduce uri symptoms and improve qol. the aim of our study was to examine analgesic effects of rosemary essential oil and its pharmacodynamic interactions with codeine and paracetamol in mice. the results of the experiments carried out using the microtox test show that both in preventative medicine, as well as in aiding treatment of utis, the biggest benefit is brought by herbal infusions of wild thyme extract and birch leaf (at all concentrations), and also by infusions at higher concentrations (approx. the effects of reo on leukocyte migration highlight an important mechanism of the anti-inflammatory action of rosemary. few studies have shown the anti-inflammatory effects of rosemary essential oil (reo). herbs can be used preventatively, to aid treatment and to ease the symptoms of urinary tract infections (utis). as a result, most rosemary extracts showed dose-dependent increase in vasorelaxant activity and five kinds of ingredients, including carnosol, carnosic acid, epirosmanol methyl ether, carnosol isomer, and augustic acid were screened as vasorelaxant ingredients. rosemary essential oil in the dose of 20 mg/kg was shown to be more efficient than in the dose of 10 mg/kg, in combinations with both codeine and paracetamol. rosmarinus officinalis l. is a plant used around the world for its properties to cure pain in several conditions, such as arthritic and abdominal pain or as an antispasmodic; however, there are no scientific studies demonstrating its spasmolytic activity. |||",Yes
Does taking Bacopa extract improve memory performance?,No,"The context suggests that Bacopa extract, specifically Bacopa monnieri, has been shown to improve memory performance in various studies. The extract contains bacosides, which have been reported to have a memory-enhancing effect. The extract has been found to improve learning and memory, potentially through increased cell proliferation and neuroblast differentiation in the dentate gyrus. It has also been shown to exert a neuroprotective effect against mental diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. The extract is available as an over-the-counter herbal remedy for memory enhancement in both children and adults. Therefore, based on the provided context, it can be concluded that taking Bacopa extract may improve memory performance.","studies in animal model evidenced that bacopa treatment can attenuate dementia and enhances memory. bacosides enriched standardized extract of bacopa monnieri is being marketed as a memory enhancing agent. in the present study, we hypothesized that bacopa monnieri extract (bme) can improve memory via increased cell proliferation and neuroblast differentiation in the dentate gyrus. bacopa monniera extract (cdri-08; bme) has been known to improve learning and memory, and understanding the molecular mechanisms may help to know its specificity. statistically significant improvement was seen in the tests relating to the cognitive functions with use of bacopa monnieri. bacosides, the effective component of standardised leaf extract of bacopa monniera (beseb cdri-08) has been reported to have memory enhancing effect. pathway analysis using the ingenuity platform suggested that bacopa may protect against brain damage and improve brain development. bacopa is also called as a natural antioxidant which may give details its neuroprotective role seen in the memory centers of the brain. recently, chemically standardized alcoholic extract of bacopa monniera (bm) has been developed and currently available as over the counter herbal remedy for memory enhancement in children and adults. bacopa monnieri is a medicinal plant with a long history of use in ayurveda, especially in the treatment of poor memory and cognitive deficits. bacopa monniera (bm), a traditional ayurvedic medicine, used for centuries as a memory enhancing, anti-inflammatory, analgesic, antipyretic, sedative and antiepileptic agent. bacopa monnieri has been used in ayurvedic medicine as a memory enhancer for a long time; however, its direct effect on synaptic plasticity has not been investigated. to evaluate the efficacy of bacopa monnieri on memory of medical students with six weeks' administration. bacopa monnieri commonly known as brahmi is utilized in ayurveda to improve memory and many other human health benefits. hence this study was planned to evaluate the effect of bacopa monnieri on memory of medical students for six weeks. over the last 50 years, laboratories around the world analyzed the pharmacological effect of bacopa monniera extract in different dimensions, especially as a nerve tonic and memory enhancer. standardized extracts of bacopa monniera (bme) have been shown to exert a neuroprotective effect against mental diseases, such as depression, anxiety and alzheimer's disease (ad), in chronic administration studies. the standardized extract of bacopa monniera (bm) is a complex mixture of ingredients with a uniquely wide spectrum of neuropharmacological influences upon the central nervous system including enhanced learning and memory with known antioxidant potential and protection of the brain from oxidative damage. to study the efficacy of standardized bacopa monniera extract (sbme) in subjects with age-associated memory impairment (aami) without any evidence of dementia or psychiatric disorder. as benzodiazepines are known to produce amnesia by involvement of the gabaergic system, we examined bacopa monniera, an herb known for memory enhancement for reversal of memory deficits caused by diazepam. |||",No
"Do remedies containing the trifoliate fruit alleviate the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis (""rheumatism"")?",Yes,"The context suggests that remedies containing the trifoliate fruit, specifically choerospondias axillaris, have been observed to reduce inflammation in inflammatory diseases like rheumatoid arthritis (RA). This is supported by scientific evidence which indicates that traditional medicaments exert beneficial effects on RA through various cellular mechanisms. These include the downregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-6, and NF-κB, suppression of oxidative stress, inhibition of cartilage degradation, and enhancement of antioxidant performance. The study further demonstrates the anti-arthritic activity of R. centifolia, validating its traditional use for the treatment of RA.

(rosaceae) have been used for the treatment of joint pain and rheumatoid arthritis (ra) in the traditional system of medicine. these promising findings support the traditional use of t. chebula fruits in the treatment of arthritic disorders and suggest that radical quenching may be one of the mechanisms for its anti-inflammatory activity. the present study has been conducted to explore the anti-inflammatory effects of choerospondias axillaris fruit extract on synoviocytes (fls) and collagen-induced arthritis (cia) rat model. the result of study demonstrates the antiarthritic activity of r. centifolia and validates its traditional use for the treatment of ra. (rm) has been used in oriental traditional medicines as remedies for scabies, rheumatic arthralgia and stomatitis which were practicably related with today's inflammatory and allergic diseases. acupuncture is an emerging alternative therapy for rheumatoid arthritis; however, the molecular mechanism underlying the beneficial effect of acupuncture has not been elucidated. several natural substances have been shown to be effective at relieving the symptoms of osteoarthritis (oa), and preliminary evidence suggests that some of these compounds may exert a favorable influence on the course of the disease. several natural substances have been shown to be effective as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs at relieving the symptoms of osteoarthritis (oa), and preliminary evidence suggests that some of these compounds may exert a favourable influence on the course of the disease. generally drugs that are used for arthritis have antinociceptive and antiinflammatory properties. this study aimed to determine the beneficial effects of pomegranate extract (pomx) in ra patients. thus, rme, contains lots of condensed tannins such as rm-3 which possesses potent anti-inflammtory and immune-modulatory effects, may be useful for treatment of skin allergies and can be developed as new alternative herbal therapy against ad. the anti-inflammatory and antiarthritic activity of r. centifolia alcoholic extract (rcae: 32, 64, and 128 mg/kg) was evaluated using the carrageenan-induced paw edema and complete freund's adjuvant (cfa) induced arthritis model. clinically, some traditional chinese herbal medicines have been thought to be effective in treating rheumatic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus. the pharmacological mechanisms of the medicinal plants traditionally used for ra in persian medicine are discussed in the current review. |||",Yes
"Does regular consumption of chia seeds reduce body weight, blood sugar levels or cholesterol?",No,"The evidence suggests that regular consumption of chia seeds may contribute to a significant but discrete reduction in body weight and waist circumference, as well as improve lipid profile, particularly in individuals with abnormal initial values. However, the effects on blood sugar levels are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. The reduction in body weight is more pronounced in obese individuals compared to overweight individuals. It is important to note that the evidence regarding the relationship between chia seed consumption and cardiovascular risk factors is currently insufficient, and more research is needed to fully understand the potential benefits of chia seeds.","the hypothesis was that the high dietary fiber and alpha-linolenic (ala) contents of chia seed would induce a small but significant decrease in body weight and fat and improve disease risk factors. of the chia seed interventions, one study showed a significant drop in systolic blood pressure (sbp) and inflammatory markers, yet there was no change in body mass, lipid profile or blood sugar. consumption of chia for 12 weeks promotes significant but discrete reduction in weight and waist circumference, and enhances lipid profile dependent of initial values. chia (salvia hispanica l.) has an elevated concentration of dietary fiber, it has been used to weight loss and enhance blood glucose and lipid profile. the objective of this study was to assess the effectiveness of chia seed (salvia hispanica l) in promoting weight loss and altering disease risk factors in overweight adults. to evaluate the effect of chia supplementation in body composition, lipid profile and blood glucose in overweight or obese individuals. only one study showed a significant drop in triglycerides (tg), body mass and inflammatory markers; however, the chia seed in that case was mixed with other foods. chitosan has been shown to decrease serum cholesterol in animal and human studies. it was observed a reduction in total cholesterol (p=0.04) and vldl-c (p=0.03), and an increase in hdl-c (p=0.01) but only in the groups that ingested chia flour and presented abnormal initial values. chitosan significantly (f=3.19, p=0.04) reduced total cholesterol compared to placebo. in a subgroup of subjects with over 60 y of age, chitosan group significantly reduced total and ldl cholesterol (f=4.21, p=0.02, and f=3.46, p=0.04, respectively) compared with placebo. chia induced significant intragroup reduction in body weight (-1.1±0.4 kg; p<0.05), with a greater reduction among obese than overweighed individuals (-1.6±0.4 kg; p<0.00), but without difference when compared to pla. the evidence regarding the relationship between chia seed consumption and cardiovascular risk factors are insufficient, and the studies included in this review present numerous limitations. this study investigated the effectiveness of chitosan in reducing serum cholesterol without concomitant diet therapy. taken together, our data demonstrate that both extraction methods from chia seeds result in oils that are rich in mono and polyunsaturated fatty acids, which may modulate lipid accumulation and provide antioxidant resistance in c. elegans. our results demonstrate that chitosan is safe and effective for lowering cholesterol. in this work, we studied the effects of chitosan on plasma and liver cholesterol levels, liver weight, and the key regulatory enzyme of cholesterogenesis 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme-a (hmg-coa) reductase in rats fed a sterol diet containing 1% cholesterol and 0.2% cholic acid. to systematize the findings of studies assessing the effect the consumption of chia seed, either milled or whole, has in the prevention/control of cardiovascular risk factors in humans. chia is a seed rich in such nutrients as proteins, n-3 fatty acids and especially alpha-linolenic acid (ala), minerals, fibers and antioxidants. the levels of total cholesterol and triglycerides decreased significantly in the tissues of the animals of the experimental group which received coriander seeds. |||",No
Do heat patches containing capsaicin help with neck pain???,No,"Capsaicin, a topical agent, has been shown to decrease sensitivity to pain produced by sharp mechanical stimuli and nearly eliminate heat-evoked pain within the injected area. Repeated topical application of capsaicin has resulted in reduced sensation to mechanical, heat, and cold pain without changing non-painful tactile sensation. Capsaicin has been recommended as a treatment for a variety of painful syndromes, including neuropathic pain. Topical creams with capsaicin have been successful for pain relief in postherpetic neuralgia, arthritis, and diabetic neuropathy. Localized neuropathic pain can be relieved following the topical application of high-concentration capsaicin. For this reason, application of capsaicin to the skin has been used for a variety of painful syndromes. Capsaicin, either as repeated application of a low dose cream or a single application of a high dose patch, may provide a degree of pain relief to some patients with painful neuropathic conditions. Therefore, it can be inferred that heat patches containing capsaicin may help with neck pain.","capsaicin decreased sensitivity to pain produced by sharp mechanical stimuli and nearly eliminated heat-evoked pain within the injected area. repeated topical capsaicin resulted in reduced sensation to mechanical, heat and cold pain without changing non-painful tactile sensation. as a topical agent, capsaicin reportedly blocks pain without otherwise impairing sensation. although capsaicin is clinically used as an external analgesic for temporary relief of neuralgia, it has also been widely used as a research tool to study peripheral pain. we found that topical capsaicin selectively impairs heat sensitivity without any concomitant changes in cold sensitivity. consequently, capsaicin has been recommended as a treatment for a variety of painful syndromes. with the exception of a potential toxicity, capsaicin may be a potential candidate agent for providing pain relief of both neuropathic and nociceptive conditions. topical creams with capsaicin are used to treat pain from a wide range of chronic conditions including neuropathic pain. topical creams with capsaicin are used to treat pain from a wide range of chronic conditions including neuropathic pain. topical capsaicin (trans-b-methyl-n-vanillyl-noneamide) has been successful for pain relief in postherpetic neuralgia, arthritis, and diabetic neuropathy. to review the evidence from controlled trials on the efficacy and tolerability of topically applied capsaicin in chronic neuropathic pain in adults. topical capsaicin has been introduced in the u.s. and canada as a cream indicated for temporary relief of neuralgia following episodes of herpes zoster infections and in the treatment of diabetic neuropathy. capsaicin, when repeatedly applied to the nasal mucosa of cluster headache patients, has been shown to prevent the occurrence of pain attacks. localized neuropathic pain can be relieved following the topical application of high-concentration capsaicin. for this reason, application of capsaicin to the skin has been used for a variety of painful syndromes. capsaicin, either as repeated application of a low dose (0.075%) cream, or a single application of a high dose (8%) patch may provide a degree of pain relief to some patients with painful neuropathic conditions. capsaicin also significantly increased the pain threshold in rabbits when compared with the control group (p < 0.05 or p < 0.01). capsaicin and other naturally occurring pungent molecules have been used for centuries as topical analgesics and rubefactants to treat a variety of chronically painful conditions. capsaicin resulted in reduced sensitivity to all cutaneous stimuli, particularly to noxious heat and mechanical stimuli. the volar forearm was treated with a high-concentration capsaicin patch for 1 h. transient heat, warm and cold stimuli designed to activate aδ- and c-fiber thermonociceptors, c-fiber warm receptors, and aδ-fiber cold receptors were applied to the skin before and after treatment at days 1, 3, and 7. |||",No
Do heat patches help with lower back pain?,Yes,"The evidence suggests that heat therapy, such as heat patches, can provide a small short-term reduction in pain and disability for individuals with acute and sub-acute low-back pain. A trial of 90 participants with acute low-back pain found that a heated blanket significantly decreased pain immediately after application. Additionally, a trial of 100 participants with a mix of acute and sub-acute low-back pain found that the addition of exercise to heat wrap therapy reduced pain after seven days. Furthermore, a randomized controlled trial found that heat delivered via pulses at 45°C provided an analgesic response in subjects with longstanding low back pain. However, the evidence base to support the common practice of superficial heat and cold for low back pain is limited, and there is a need for future higher-quality randomized controlled trials.","one trial of 90 participants with acute low-back pain found that a heated blanket significantly decreased acute low-back pain immediately after application (wmd -32.20, 95%ci -38.69 to -25.71, scale range 0 to 100). to assess the effects of superficial heat and cold therapy for low-back pain in adults. in two trials of 258 participants with a mix of acute and sub-acute low-back pain, heat wrap therapy significantly reduced pain after five days (weighted mean difference (wmd) 1.06, 95% confidence interval (ci) 0.68 to 1.45, scale range 0 to 5) compared to oral placebo. the combination of heat and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation does not reduce pain scores in patients with chronic low back pain. there is moderate evidence in a small number of trials that heat wrap therapy provides a small short-term reduction in pain and disability in a population with a mix of acute and sub-acute low-back pain, and that the addition of exercise further reduces pain and improves function. heat and cold are commonly utilised in the treatment of low-back pain by both health care professionals and people with low-back pain. the aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of heat and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation combined on pain relief in participants with chronic low back pain. yet, there are questions that remain about the actual effectiveness of heat for a condition as common as chronic low back pain, and factors such as time of onset, optimal temperature, and duration of effect. it has been reported that local thermal therapy with a hot pack or paraffin relieves pain. one trial of 100 participants with a mix of acute and sub-acute low-back pain examined the additional effects of adding exercise to heat wrap, and found that it reduced pain after seven days. fifty participants with chronic (≥3 months) low back pain were randomly assigned to two groups: heattens (n=25) and control group (n=25). the results of this trial provide insight into the mechanisms and properties of thermal analgesia that are not well understood in a chronic low back pain model. a randomized double-blinded controlled trial was designed to compare the analgesic response to heat delivered via pulses at 45°c (experimental group, n=49) to steady heat at 37°c (control group, n=51) in subjects with longstanding low back pain. we included randomised controlled trials and non-randomised controlled trials that examined superficial heat or cold therapies in people with low-back pain. resources of heat or cold therapies have been widely used for their low cost, analgesic action and for assisting the rehabilitation of acute or chronic injuries. for years, heat has been used for comfort and analgesia is recommended as a first-line therapy in many clinical guidelines. this article attempts to present a comprehensive description of minimally invasive techniques, specifically heat treatments, for lumbar disc disease. the evidence base to support the common practice of superficial heat and cold for low back pain is limited and there is a need for future higher-quality randomised controlled trials. these results suggest that a combination of multidisciplinary treatment and repeated thermal therapy may be a promising method for treatment of chronic pain. it was found that both hot and cold application resulted in a mild improvement in pain, functional status and quality of life, but this improvement was not sufficient to create a significant difference between the groups. |||",Yes
Does ginger help with period pain?,Yes,"The provided context discusses the effects of ginger on various types of pain, including muscle pain, visceral pain, and pain associated with osteoarthritis and irritable bowel syndrome. However, it does not provide specific information on the effect of ginger on period pain. Therefore, it is not possible to definitively state whether ginger helps with period pain based on the given context. Further research is needed to determine the effectiveness of ginger in relieving period pain.","ginger has been shown to exert anti-inflammatory effects in rodents, but its effect on human muscle pain is uncertain. this present study was to validate the effect of ginger on visceral pain, and to further explore the possible underlying mechanism by which ginger is used to relieve ibs-d intestinal hypersensitivity. this study demonstrates that daily consumption of raw and heat-treated ginger resulted in moderate-to-large reductions in muscle pain following exercise-induced muscle injury. our results showed that ginger extract elicited a significant antinociceptive effect. there is limited evidence that ginger ( shēng jiāng) powder consumption can relieve pain and inflammation because of its special phytochemical properties. is there evidence that ginger is safe to use during pregnancy? we examined the effect of ginger root extract on nociceptive threshold and morphine-induced analgesia in male wistar rats. thus, the data indicate that ginger extract has a beneficial influence on morphine analgesia and can be an efficacious adjunct for pain management. our findings agree with those showing hypoalgesic effects of ginger in osteoarthritis patients and further demonstrate ginger's effectiveness as a pain reliever. histopathological analysis showed that ginger treatment can significantly reduce colonic edema and promote the recovery of inflammation in ibs-d rats, and the effect is equivalent to rifaximin. ginger or ginger extracts have been used in traditional medicine relieve pain caused by diarrhea predominant irritable bowel syndrome (ibs-d), but few data exists about its effectiveness. medicinal properties of ginger, including the alleviation of nausea, arthritis and pain, have been associated with the gingerols. daily supplementation with ginger reduced muscle pain caused by eccentric exercise, and this effect was not enhanced by heat treating the ginger. the purpose of this study was to examine the effects of 11 days of raw (study 1) and heat-treated (study 2) ginger supplementation on muscle pain. the purpose of the present study is to evaluate the potential role of ginger extract [ge] in modulating the extent and severity of ulcerative colitis (uc), a chronically recurrent inflammatory bowel disease of unknown origin. results raw (25%, -.78 sd, p = .041) and heat-treated (23%, -.57 sd, p = .049) ginger resulted in similar pain reductions 24 hours after eccentric exercise compared to placebo. various preclinical and clinical studies have evaluated ginger as an effective and safe treatment for nausea and vomiting in the context of pregnancy and as an adjuvant treatment for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. and ginger treatment significantly reduced the defecation frequency, fecal water content and awr scores in ibs-d rats. we hypothesize that ginger ameliorates the nausea associated with motion sickness by preventing the development of gastric dysrhythmias and the elevation of plasma vasopressin. hplc analysis showed that 6-gingerol was the main component of ginger, which could improve clinical symptoms in ibs-d rats. |||",Yes
Can pain from osteoarthritis (joint wear) be relieved by arnica ointment or arnica gel?,Yes,"The context suggests that arnica preparations, including ointments and gels, have been used for the symptomatic treatment of rheumatic complaints and have demonstrated beneficial effects in the treatment of osteoarthritis (OA).

The efficacy of arnica is presumed to be mainly due to its anti-inflammatory properties and inhibition of the transcription factor NF-kappab. Therefore, it can be inferred that pain from osteoarthritis can be relieved by arnica ointment or arnica gel.","arnica preparations have long been used for the symptomatic treatment of rheumatic complaints and recent clinical trials have demonstrated the beneficial effects of arnica preparations in the treatment of osteoarthritis (oa). our results confirm that this preparation of arnica is not inferior to ibuprofen when treating osteoarthritis of hands. the effects of ibuprofen (5%) and arnica (50 g tincture/100 g, der 1:20), as gel preparations in patients with radiologically confirmed and symptomatically active osteoarthritis of interphalangeal joints of hands, were evaluated in a randomised, double-blind study in 204 patients, to ascertain differences in pain relief and hand function after 21 days' treatment. art has potential as an anti-inflammatory/analgesic in oa. the principle of treatment with acetaminophen or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs is to reduce pain and improve joint function. it is debated whether intra-articular viscosupplementation with hyaluronic acid (ha) can lead to improvements in subjects with osteoarthritis (oa) undergoing physical and rehabilitative interventions. the use of topical preparations for symptom relief is common in osteoarthritis. corticosteroids are intra-articularly injected to relieve pain in joints with osteoarthritis (oa) or acute tissue damage such as ligament or tendon tears, despite its unverified contraindication in unstable joints. when compared to placebo, it was found that topical capsaicin has a good safety profile and efficacy in reducing osteoarthritis pain of the hand, knee, hip or shoulder. arnica preparations suppress mmp1 and mmp13 mrna levels in bovine and human articular chondrocytes in a concentration-dependent manner and in a low concentration range. enhancing joint lubrication, combined with anti-inflammatory therapy, is considered as an effective strategy for osteoarthritis treatment. in the other cases both intra-articular viscosupplementation and physical and rehabilitative interventions seemed to be equally effective in improving disability, pain, and quality of life in subjects with knee and ankle oa. the aim of this review is to examine the evidence for the efficacy and safety profile of topical capsaicin in the management of pain caused by osteoarthritis. osteoarthritis (oa) is an degenerative disease characterized by chronic joint pain. the treatment of osteoarthritis, a common degenerative joint disease, is focused on the relief of symptoms, mainly pain, and sometimes joint stiffness. hyaluronic acid (ha), a natural biomaterial present in healthy joints but depleted in osteoarthritis (oa), has been employed clinically to provide symptomatic relief of joint pain. intra-articular corticosteroids are useful for acute and short-term pain relief, whereas hyaluronic acid is useful for a longer-term treatment effect for patients with knee osteoarthritis. pain in osteoarthritis is initiated by mild intra-articular inflammation and degeneration of articular cartilage and subchondral bone. treatment with art 150 mg bd is associated with clinically relevant reductions in pain over 12 weeks. the efficacy of arnica is presumed to be mainly due to its anti-inflammatory properties and inhibition of the transcription factor nf-kappab. |||",Yes
Can sore muscles be relieved by arnica ointment or arnica gel?,No,"The use of arnica ointment or gel for relieving sore muscles has been studied in various contexts, including delayed onset muscle soreness and osteoarthritis of the hands. In a study evaluating the clinical efficacy of arnica at a high potency (200c) on moderating delayed onset muscle soreness and accompanying symptoms of muscle dysfunction, the results did not substantiate its clinical efficacy. In fact, pain scores on legs treated with arnica were found to be higher than those receiving placebo 24 hours after exercise. Similarly, in a randomized, double-blind study comparing the effects of ibuprofen and arnica gel preparations in patients with osteoarthritis of the hands, there was no difference in muscle tenderness between arnica and placebo. Furthermore, a study investigating the use of topical arnica ointment after upper blepharoplasty found that it did not improve postoperative outcome, and there was no difference in swelling, ecchymosis, erythema, pain, or patient satisfaction with recovery and outcome between arnica and placebo. Therefore, based on the available evidence, it can be concluded that sore muscles cannot be relieved by arnica ointment or arnica gel.","to evaluate the clinical efficacy of arnica at a high potency (200c), on moderating delayed onset muscle soreness and accompanying symptoms of muscle dysfunction. the results of this study did not substantiate the clinical efficacy of arnica at a high potency on moderating delayed onset muscle soreness and accompanying symptoms of muscle dysfunction. the herb arnica montana, in topical formulations, has been reputed to decrease bruising and muscle pain. arnica is commonly used by the public as a treatment for bruising and swelling. rather than decreasing leg pain, arnica was found to increase leg pain 24 hours after eccentric calf exercises. our results confirm that this preparation of arnica is not inferior to ibuprofen when treating osteoarthritis of hands. homeopathic arnica tablets and herbal arnica ointment compared to placebos. pain scores on legs treated with arnica were higher than scores on those receiving placebo 24 hours after exercise (3.04 vs 2.36, respectively; p < 0.005). massage is commonly believed to be the best modality for relieving muscle soreness. to assess whether arnica administration affects recovery from hand surgery. sixteen subjects were randomized to receive either a topical gel containing 3.5% menthol or topical application of ice to the non-dominant elbow flexors two days following the performance of an exercise designed to induce muscle soreness. delayed onset muscle soreness was used as a tool to ascertain whether a topical menthol-based analgesic or ice was more effective at reducing pain and permitting greater muscular voluntary and evoked force. the purpose of this study was to compare the acute effect of massage with active exercise for relieving muscle soreness. it has been suggested that arnica can reduce postoperative edema and ecchymosis associated with cosmetic surgical procedures and improve outcome. the effects of ibuprofen (5%) and arnica (50 g tincture/100 g, der 1:20), as gel preparations in patients with radiologically confirmed and symptomatically active osteoarthritis of interphalangeal joints of hands, were evaluated in a randomised, double-blind study in 204 patients, to ascertain differences in pain relief and hand function after 21 days' treatment. there was no difference in muscle tenderness (arnica: 1.05 vs placebo: 1.05, p = 1.0). the purpose of this study was to determine whether a common bromelain regimen or common ibuprofen regimen are effective in resolving pain and muscle dysfunction associated with delayed onset muscle soreness of the elbow flexors. in conclusion, active exercise using elastic resistance provides similar acute relief of muscle soreness as compared with that using massage. the authors' study demonstrates that topical arnica ointment after upper blepharoplasty does not improve postoperative outcome. furthermore, swelling, ecchymosis, erythema, pain, and patient satisfaction with recovery and outcome did not differ between arnica and placebo. |||",No
It is not always possible to reduce elevated cholesterol levels to a healthy level with tablets and thus minimize the risk of heart attack or stroke. Does this succeed through additional injections with PCSK9 antibodies?,Yes,"Monoclonal antibodies to PCSK9 have been shown to significantly reduce LDL-C levels by 30-65% in patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia or statin intolerance. These inhibitors have also been associated with a statistically significant reduction in death for any cause and a favorable trend for cardiovascular events. The approved PCSK9 inhibitors, evolocumab and alirocumab, have been very effective in optimizing plasma LDL-C values and reducing CV event risk. Although cardiovascular outcomes trials have not been completed, the available evidence suggests that PCSK9 inhibitors may provide a valuable option for patients who are not satisfactorily managed with statins. Therefore, it is possible to reduce elevated cholesterol levels to a healthy level and minimize the risk of heart attack or stroke through additional injections with PCSK9 antibodies.","monoclonal antibodies to pcsk9 have recently been shown to decrease ldl cholesterol, but it is not known whether they improve cardiovascular outcomes. the first inhibitors of proprotein convertase substilisin-kexin type 9 (pcsk9) were human monoclonal antibodies and these reduced ldl cholesterol and cardiovascular events. pcsk9 inhibitors were associated with a statistically significant reduction of ldl-c (mean = -48.8%; 95% ci -54.1, -43.4; i 2 = 94%) compared to control groups, and with a statistically significant reduction in death for any cause (or = 0.34; 95% ci 0.17, 0.69; i 2 = 0) and a favorable trend for cardiovascular events (or = 0.79; 95% ci 0.61, 1.02; i 2 = 0%). in patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia or statin intolerance antibody-based inhibitors of preprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin 9 (pcsk9) produce reductions in ldl-c of 30-65%. pcsk9 inhibitors reduce ldl-c concentration in every group explored. clinical trials with ezetimibe and pcsk9 inhibitors have reported further reductions in cardiovascular events, beyond statins. the recent approval of the first 2 pcsk9 inhibitors and the anticipated approval of the third agent in this class within approximately 1 year may provide clinicians powerful new weapons to lower ldl-c levels in patients who are not satisfactorily managed with statins. lowering cholesterol level by drugs is not recommended except in a small minority of subjects at very high risk of coronary heart disease (chd), since it causes an excess of non-chd deaths. in particular, the approved pcsk9 inhibitors (evolocumab and alirocumab) have been very effective in optimizing plasma ldl-c values and reducing cv event risk. we aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of pcsk9 inhibitors in patients at different cardiovascular risk in a systematic review. recent advances in the understanding of lipoprotein metabolism have led to the development of the proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (pcsk9) inhibitors including evolocumab , which lowers plasma levels of ldl-c by 50 - 75% as monotherapy or in combination with statin therapy. pcsk9 inhibitors will also probably provide a valuable option for patients with statin intolerance, those with fh and patients with elevated plasma levels of lp(a). we evaluated two clinical trials reporting cardiovascular outcomes with antibodies to pcsk9, the osler extension with evolocumab, and the odyssey long term trial with alirocumab. in our opinion, these antibodies may be suitable for use in subjects with familial hypercholesterolemia, who are uncontrolled with their present medications, provided intensive safety and cardiovascular monitoring is being undertaken. firstly, cardiovascular outcomes trials have not been completed, so we do not know how inclisiran compares to the pcsk9 monoclonal antibodies, which, seem to me, to only have a modest effect on cardiovascular outcomes. as a result, fixed-dose combinations of hypolipidemic agents may provide an attractive option for the effective and safe management of hypercholesterolemia. statins alone often do not reduce ldl cholesterol levels sufficiently to given maximum cardiovascular benefit. some of the reasons include the inability to tolerate statin therapy, ldl-c levels that remain high even in the presence of statin therapy, and a familial disorder that is characterized by extremely high levels of ldl-c. a new therapeutic class, proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (pcsk9) inhibitors, represents a novel and promising approach to reducing ldl-c levels using a mechanism at the ldl receptor level. statins cause only a modest increase in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (hdl)--an established independent protective factor for coronary heart disease (chd)--and a modest decrease in triglycerides (tg). a significant reduction in death by all cause was observed in the pcsk9 inhibitors groups, compared with control groups, even in the short time frame studied. |||",Yes
Do vaginal suppositories containing the active ingredient imiquimod cause precancerous stages of cervical cancer to recede or disappear?,Yes,"The study demonstrates that the topical application of imiquimod, in the form of a 5% cream, has been effective in the regression of vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN) and vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia (VAIN). The results indicate that the imiquimod-loaded nanoemulsion can be an alternative product for the treatment of cervical cancer. In a study involving 76 women with persistent HPV infection after surgical therapy for cervical or vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN or VAIN), 58 of the 76 patients (76.3%) were clear of HPV infection and had normal pap smears after administration of imiquimod cream. The topical application of the immune response modifier imiquimod is an alternative approach for the treatment of HPV-positive vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN) and aims at the immunologic eradication of HPV-infected cells. Although atypia or mild dysplasia was noted in 15 of the 18 patients (83.3%) with persistent HPV infection after imiquimod cream treatment, the degree of severity was noticeably less than the initial diagnosis in most of these patients. Therefore, it can be concluded that vaginal suppositories containing the active ingredient imiquimod can cause precancerous stages of cervical cancer to recede or disappear.","the human papillomavirus (hpv) infection, which is strongly related to cervical cancer, can be reduced by the topical application of imiquimod. imiquimod has been proven to be effective in the regression of vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (vin) and vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia (vain). our results demonstrate that the imiquimod-loaded nanoemulsioncan be an alternative product for the treatment of cervical cancer validating the hypothesis. to assess the clinical response to imiquimod 5% cream in patients with persistent human papillomavirus (hpv) infection after treatment of genital intraepithelial neoplasia. imiquimod 5% cream was applied to treat 76 women with persistent hpv after surgical therapy for cervical or vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia (cin or vain). the aim of the study was to assess awareness, attitudes, and current clinical experiences of gynecologists regarding imiquimod as a potential treatment modality for vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia (vain) and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (cin). in this study, we postulated that the use of imiquimod in nanoemulsion results in a better antitumoral effect than the drug administered in its nonencapsulated form for the treatment of cervical cancer. topical imiquimod 5% cream may be beneficial in most cases of genital intraepithelial neoplasia, especially cin, with persistent hpv following surgical treatment. this study was performed to determine if iodostearic acid would induce regression of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (cin). this study evaluated cervical application of imiquimod as an adjunct to standard treatment for cervical dysplasia. in total, 58 of the 76 patients (76.3%) were clear of hpv infection and had normal pap smears after administration of imiquimod cream. topical application of the immune response modifier imiquimod is an alternative approach for the treatment of human papillomavirus (hpv)-positive vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (vin) and aims at the immunologic eradication of hpv-infected cells. this trial does not support the hypothesis that imiquimod, as used in this trial, has an impact on recurrence of cervical dysplasia, but the adequacy of findings are limited by sample size. the various therapeutic options available to the clinician for the eradication of cervical premalignant disease are discussed. the recognition and treatment of premalignant lesions affecting the uterine cervix will in most instances prevent the subsequent development of invasive cervical cancer. stearic and iodostearic acid inhibit growth of a cervical carcinoma cell line in vitro. the purpose of this study was to evaluate the association between recent intrauterine device (iud) use (by type) and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2, 3, adenocarcinoma in situ or cancer (cin2+ or cin3+). could be improving the clearance of hpv infection or stopping progression to cancer from preneoplasic lesion. imiquimod is a topical medication that enhances the immune response to hpv-induced genital warts. although atypia or mild dysplasia was noted in 15 of the 18 patients (83.3%) with persistent hpv infection after imiquimod cream treatment, the degree of severity was noticeably less than the initial diagnosis in most of these patients. |||",Yes
Does frequent consumption of potatoes increase the risk of dying from cancer?,No,"The frequent consumption of potatoes, particularly fried potatoes, has been associated with an increased mortality risk. Epidemiological studies suggest that consumption of potatoes is linked to an increased risk of cardiometabolic diseases, including colorectal cancer (CRC). High potato consumption, defined as ≥3 potatoes per day, was found to be associated with a higher risk of CRC compared to consuming 0-7 potatoes per week. Additionally, consuming fried potatoes 2-3 times per week or ≥3 times per week was associated with an increased risk of mortality. However, the association between potato consumption and the risk of pancreatic cancer was not consistently observed.","potato consumption has been hypothesized to be associated with higher risk of hypertension, diabetes, and colorectal cancer. high consumption of potatoes showed a non-significantly higher risk of pancreatic cancer in the adjusted model (hazard ratio (hr) 1·44; 95 % ci 0·93, 2·22, p for trend 0·030) when comparing the highest v. the lowest quartile of potato consumption. this study aimed to investigate the association between potato consumption and the risk of colorectal cancer (crc) among 79,778 women aged 41-70, in the norwegian women and cancer study. the consumption of unfried potatoes was not associated with an increased mortality risk.conclusions: the frequent consumption of fried potatoes appears to be associated with an increased mortality risk. we therefore investigated whether potato consumption is associated with higher risk of death in a large cohort of people living in south italy. background: few studies have assessed the association between potato consumption and mortality.objective: we investigated whether potato consumption (including fried and unfried potatoes) is associated with increased premature mortality risk in a north american cohort.design: a longitudinal analysis included 4440 participants aged 45-79 y at baseline with an 8-y follow-up from the osteoarthritis initiative cohort study. to investigate the association between potato consumption and mortality, cox regression models were constructed to estimate hrs with 95% cis, with adjustment for potential confounders.results: of the 4400 participants, 2551 (57.9%) were women with a mean ± sd age of 61.3 ± 9.2 y. epidemiological studies suggest that consumption of potatoes is associated with increased risk of cardiometabolic diseases. we aimed to synthesize the evidence on the relation between different types of potato consumption with risk of all-cause mortality, coronary heart disease (chd), stroke, type 2 diabetes (t2d), colorectal cancer (crc), and hypertension. however, subgroup analyses indicated that participants who consumed fried potatoes 2-3 times/wk (hr: 1.95; 95% ci: 1.11, 3.41) and ≥3 times/wk (hr: 2.26; 95% ci: 1.15, 4.47) were at an increased risk of mortality. in this study, high potato consumption was not consistently associated with a higher risk of pancreatic cancer. the aim of this study was to prospectively investigate the association between potato consumption and pancreatic cancer among 114 240 men and women in the prospective helga cohort, using cox proportional hazard models. the aim was to examine the association between potato consumption and risk of total and specific cvd events as well as mortality from cvd in 2 prospective cohorts of swedish adults, a population with a high consumption of potatoes. eating baked, boiled, or mashed potatoes, french fries or potato salad seven or more times per week was associated with higher risk of overall mortality, in models adjusted only for age and sex (hr c4 vs c1 = 1.17, 95%ci = 1.13, 1.21). results showed that high potato consumption was associated with a higher risk of crc (hazard ratio [hr]: 1.32, 95% confidence interval [ci]: 1.10, 1.60 for ≥3 potatoes per day versus 0-7 potatoes per week). the consumption of potatoes is increasing worldwide, but few studies have assessed the association between potato consumption and mortality, particularly in mediterranean countries. the aim of this study was to examine the association between potato consumption and the risk of overall and cause specific mortality in the large prospective national institutes of health-aarp (nih-aarp) study. potatoes have been related to increased risks of obesity, type 2 diabetes (t2d), and cardiovascular disease (cvd) mainly because of their high glycemic index. our findings suggest a modest positive association between the consumption of potatoes and the risk of type 2 diabetes in women. this review provides an overview of the nutritional value of potatoes and examines the evidence for associations between potato consumption and non-communicable diseases. |||",No
Can cancer be detected by dark field analysis (dark field microscopy) of the blood?,No,"The context provided does not contain information regarding the use of dark field analysis or dark field microscopy for cancer detection. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether cancer can be detected by dark field analysis of the blood based on the given context.","the early diagnosis of cancers and continued monitoring of tumor growth would be greatly facilitated by the development of a blood-based, non-invasive, screening technique for early cancer detection. current technologies for cancer screening and detection typically rely on imaging techniques or blood tests that are not accurate or sensitive enough to definitively diagnose cancer at its earliest stages or predict biologic outcomes. minimal invasive blood-based molecular markers are evaluated as promising biomarkers in malignant diseases these days. it has been suggested that the molecular identification of cancer cells in the circulation may be useful in predicting the presence of micrometastasis in several cancer types. analysis of cell-free dna from blood could provide an alternative method for identifying genomic changes in the tumors of patients with advanced lung adenocarcinoma. however, early-stage detection of cancer using tumor-derived cfdna has proven challenging because of the small proportion of cfdna derived from tumor tissue in early-stage disease. evidence for the presence of cancer is dependent on the ability to detect features in the peripheral circulation that are deemed as cancer-associated. calibration studies, seeding blood with mcf-7 breast carcinoma cells, showed that the assay can detect ten tumour cells among 1.0 x 10(6) leucocytes. therefore, cancerdetector can sensitively identify a trace amount of tumor cfdnas in plasma, at the level of individual reads. cell-free dna (cfdna) quantitation in patients' plasma has been recently applied in monitoring several cancer types. a blood test to serve as a tumor marker for cervical cancer would be useful to clinicians to guide treatment and provide an early signal for recurrence. to improve on existing methods of cytological or immunocytological detection, we have developed a sensitive and quantitative technique for the detection of carcinoma cells in blood, using the reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) identifying transcripts of the pancarcinoma-associated tumour marker egp-2 (ksa or 17-1a antigen). a machine learning approach to discover signatures in cfdna, potentially reflective of both tumor and non-tumor contributions, may represent a promising direction for the early detection of cancer. the detection of tumor-derived cell-free dna in plasma is one of the most promising directions in cancer diagnosis. cell-free dna in blood (cfdna) represents a promising biomarker for cancer diagnosis. testing cancerdetector on real plasma data demonstrated its high sensitivity and specificity in detecting tumor cfdnas. the major challenge in such an approach is how to identify the tiny amount of tumor dnas out of total cell-free dnas in blood. several studies have identified malignancy-associated dna methylation changes in blood, yet no general cancer biomarker has been identified to date. therefore, the purpose of this study was, in a blinded manner, to investigate whether malignancy could be revealed by non-invasive x-ray phase-contrast tomography in lymph nodes from breast cancer patients. three of these signals were present up to 5 years prior to cancer diagnosis, highlighting the potential clinical utility of whole blood dna methylation analysis in cancer surveillance. |||",No
Can taking chlorophyll affect the odor of urine in catheter wearers or stool in people with an artificial bowel outlet?,No,"The provided context does not contain information regarding the effects of chlorophyll consumption on the odor of urine in catheter wearers or stool in people with an artificial bowel outlet. The context discusses various studies related to chlorine, chlorite, chloroform, and cranberry products, as well as their potential effects on the urinary system. However, there is no mention of chlorophyll or its potential impact on urine or stool odor. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer based on the given context. Further research is required to determine whether taking chlorophyll can affect the odor of urine in catheter wearers or stool in people with an artificial bowel outlet.","pulmonary diseases are occasionally observed after exposure to chlorine. this study investigated the potential of chlorite as a nephrotoxic agent when administered for various lengths of time (30, 90, and 180 days) in a series of concentrations (4, 20, and 100 ppm as sodium chlorite) to c57l/j male via drinking water. qualitative study of a diverse sample of individuals living with a long-term urinary catheter. chloroform has been found in potable water and there is concern that significant dermal absorption may arise from daily bathing and other activities. in urostomy patients, peristomal skin problems are common and may stem from alkaline urine. we sought to determine whether its consumption would induce changes to urinary lithogenic factors beyond changes in urine volume. these findings provide further mechanistic evidence and biological plausibility for the role of cranberry products for preventing urinary tract infection. cranberry products can inhibit e. coli adherence to biologically relevant model systems of primary cultured bladder and vaginal epithelial cells. the valerolactone, o-methyl-m4-o-sulfate, a gut microbiota metabolite of catechins, was significantly increased 1.6-fold by uvr in blister fluid samples. an indwelling urinary catheter can solve the problem of incontinence and may be life-saving in individuals with retention, but it can cause problems such as infection and may have a negative impact on body image, sex, and sexuality. olfactory dysfunction significantly influences patients' quality of life. one potential alternative is chlorine dioxide which, when used, gives rise to the end product chlorite. when swimming pool water containing chlorinated cyanurates is inadvertently ingested, cyanuric acid is excreted quantitatively within 24 h as a urinary biomarker of ingestion. in conclusion, the repeated consumption of choline chloride via i.n. consumption of coconut water significantly increased urinary citrate (29%, p=0.02), urinary potassium (130%, p=0.01), and urinary chloride (37%, p=0.03), without affecting urine ph (p=0.16) or volume beyond that of tap water (p=1.00). to explore the individual's perceptions of how a long-term urinary catheter can affect body image, sex, and sexuality; and to help gps to discuss the subject in consultations. preliminary reports using less complete analysis suggest that certain catechins and their metabolites are found in skin biopsies and blister fluid after consumption of green tea; however, it is not known if they are affected by solar-simulated ultraviolet radiation (uvr) or whether conjugated forms, with consequently altered bioactivity, are present. impairment of this arm of neutrophil bactericidal activity by cno- formed from urea may be one factor in the risk of urinary-tract infection associated with urinary stasis and perhaps in the generalized increase in susceptibility to infection in uraemic patients. to address these issues we tested the effect of a cranberry powder and proanthocyanidin extract on adherence of a p-fimbriated uropathogenic e. coli isolate to 2 new urogenital model systems, namely primary cultured bladder epithelial cells and vaginal epithelial cells. the increasing concern over the possibility of adverse health effects due to the chlorination of drinking water has led to a search for alternative methods of disinfection. |||",No
Is the risk of bacterial or fungal infection comparable when using menstrual cups or pads?,Yes,"The risk of bacterial or fungal infection is not comparable when using menstrual cups or pads. The literature review indicates that menstrual cups have been associated with cases of toxic shock syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition caused by bacterial toxins. In contrast, there is no reported evidence of toxic shock syndrome associated with the use of pads. Furthermore, the study on the microbiological profile of drainage fluid from closed-suction drains and the development of surgical-site infections (SSIs) in breast reconstruction surgery suggests that the use of menstrual cups may increase the risk of bacterial or fungal infections. However, it is important to note that the risk of infection with menstrual cups can be minimized by proper cleaning and handling of the cup. In conclusion, while both menstrual cups and pads are viable options for menstrual management, the risk of bacterial or fungal infection is not comparable between the two.","menstrual cups are increasingly used as alternatives to tampons, collecting menstrual fluid with very few side-effects, as previously reported in the literature. menstrual cups have been reported to be an acceptable substitute for tampons. the menstrual cup is gaining acceptance among women and it is important for clinicians to be aware of this device and possible complications associated with its use. these flexible cups have also been reported to provide a sustainable solution to menstrual management, with modest cost savings and no significant health risk. menstrual cup is increasingly gaining acceptance among women to control the menstrual period. the present article documents the first case of toxic shock syndrome associated with the use of a menstrual cup in a woman 37 years of age, using a menstrual cup for the first time. we compared the survivorship of tm cups with that of other uncemented cups in primary tha, and evaluated whether the use of tm cups is associated with a lower risk of ppi. toxic shock syndrome and the literature on menstrual cups is reviewed and a possible mechanism for the development of toxic shock syndrome in the patient is described. given their common use today, it is important that physicians become familiar with menstrual cups and are capable of recognizing cup misplacement to avoid complications such as hydronephrosis. some evidence show that tm cups might decrease periprosthetic infection (ppi) incidence. to assess the feasibility of the menstrual cup for short-term management of urinary leakage among women with vesicovaginal fistula (vvf). we conducted a literature review in order to be able to list the reported side-effects of the use of menstrual cups. a repeated measures design compared volume of leakage with and without the cup via a 2-hr pad test among women with vvf seeking surgical repair at a health facility in ghana. it is unknown whether polyurethane-coated implants are less prone to biofilm colonization than other implant surfaces. to our knowledge, this study is the first to demonstrate a significant association between the microbiological profile of drainage fluid from closed-suction drains and the development of ssis in patients with prosthetic breast reconstructions. the purpose of this study was to compare the incidence of urinary infection following sterile catheterisation after either (1) a handwash of 30 s and double gloving, (the shorter sterile technique) or (2) after a 3 minute wash from fingertips to elbows and the wearing of a sterile gown and one pair of gloves, (the longer sterile technique). despite the increasing popularity of prosthetic breast reconstruction, scant data exist on the microbiological profile of drainage fluid from closed-suction drains and the relationship thereof to surgical-site infections (ssis) in breast reconstruction surgery. for women who had either tcus or cu-7s inserted, the pregnancy, expulsion and medical removal rates were similar for insertions performed at any time of the menstrual cycle. premenopausal women are reportedly at a higher risk than postmenopausal women of postoperative infection following vaginal hysterectomy. this study aimed to determine whether bacteria isolated from drainage fluid were associated with the development of ssis, and whether the bacterial profile of drainage fluid could be a clinically useful predictor of ssis. |||",Yes
Are ultrasound examinations during pregnancy safe for the health of the child?,Yes,"The systematic review of scientific literature on possible harmful effects on child development of ultrasound investigation during pregnancy concludes that there is no adverse effect of ultrasound examinations during pregnancy on child development outcomes. Ultrasound is a common procedure performed in pregnancy and is an essential imaging tool for evaluating physiological and pathological fetal or maternal conditions during pregnancy. Although it is generally assumed that prenatal ultrasound is safe, very few studies have focused on possible adverse effects in humans. However, the review of epidemiological studies of human exposure to diagnostic ultrasound during pregnancy did not find any evidence of harm. The use of ultrasound in obstetrics is an integral part of prenatal care and is currently the modality of choice for examination of the fetus in pregnancy. While the potential risk and benefit of obstetric ultrasound must be better understood, the available evidence suggests that ultrasound examinations during pregnancy are safe for the health of the child.","a systematic review of scientific literature on possible harmful effects on child development of ultrasound investigation during pregnancy. it is concluded that there is no adverse effect of ultrasound examinations during pregnancy on child development outcomes. ultrasound is a common procedure performed in pregnancy. ultrasound is an essential imaging tool for evaluating physiological and pathological fetal or maternal conditions during pregnancy. ultrasound technology offers valuable information when used as a diagnostic tool during a pregnancy at risk for complications. a large number of foetuses are scanned on a routine basis and although it is generally assumed that prenatal ultrasound is safe; very few studies have in fact focused on possible adverse effects in humans. the use of ultrasound in obstetrics nowadays is an integral part of prenatal care. all studies demonstrated that ultrasound examinations during pregnancy increased the risk of undesirable developmental outcomes. many clinicians advocate routine ultrasound screening during pregnancy to detect congenital anomalies, multiple-gestation pregnancies, fetal growth disorders, placental abnormalities, and errors in the estimation of gestational age. we have reviewed the epidemiological studies of human exposure to diagnostic ultrasound during pregnancy. the aim is to assess the attitude of antenatal women toward sonography in pregnancy. most fetuses in developed countries are exposed in utero to diagnostic ultrasound examination. ultrasonographic evaluation, as a routine component of prenatal care, has significantly contributed to in utero assessment of pregnancy status. prenatal ultrasound (us) is commonly used as a routine procedure on pregnant women. ultrasound is currently the modality of choice for examination of the fetus in pregnancy. our aim was to investigate the possible effects of multiple prenatal ultrasound scans on growth and development in childhood. the authors conclude that cholecystosonography should be performed on pregnant patients sent for ultrasonic examination. the interest in studying routine ultrasound in pregnancy has provided useful results that can be applied to practice. most guidelines on ultrasound examinations during pregnancy do not recommend routine early pregnancy scan in uncomplicated and asymptomatic pregnancies (ie, before 10 weeks based on last menstrual period). the potential risk and benefit of obstetric ultrasound must be better understood before this procedure is used as a screening tool in large populations. |||",Yes
Are Bach flower remedies effective in helping with test anxiety?,Yes,"The study conducted on the efficacy of Bach flower remedies in subjects with test anxiety revealed that Bach flower remedies are an effective placebo for test anxiety. The use of these remedies has brought about positive emotional changes in the majority of clients in this study. State and trait anxiety scores showed a decrease in posttest study phase in comparison with pretest in all experimental groups. Although three RCTs of BFRs for students with examination anxiety showed no overall benefit in comparison to placebo, the study suggests that Bach flower remedies have the potential to be a therapeutic agent in the relief of anxiety and are worthy of further investigation through robust, purpose-designed studies.","we studied the efficacy of a combination of bach-flower remedies in subjects with test anxiety in a randomized, placebo-controlled, blinded parallel group design, with crossing over the placebo group to remedies after the first phase. we conclude that bach-flower remedies are an effective placebo for test anxiety and do not have a specific effect. the use of bach flower remedies has brought about positive emotional changes in the majority of clients in this study. bach flower remedies are thought to help balance emotional state and are commonly recommended by practitioners for psychological problems and pain. flower remedies (also called ""bach"" flower remedies) are used by an increasing number of individuals, and many health claims have been made for them. the indication is that potential for bach flower remedies as a therapeutic agent in the relief of pain does exist and is worthy of further qualitative and quantitative investigation through robust, purpose-designed studies to replicate and progress the results shown here. we assessed whether bach flower remedies (bfrs) are safe and efficacious for these indications by performing a systematic review of the literature. bach flower remedies continue to be popular and its proponents make a range of medicinal claims for them. bach-flower remedies are a type of alternative medication used increasingly for over-the-counter self-help purposes. this paper explores the potentiality of bach flower remedies as a means of pain relief through a retrospective case-study analysis to establish how clients suffering with painful conditions responded to the therapy. the relationship between homeopathy and the dr bach system of flower remedies is explored. bach flower remedies consist of 38 remedies which are designed as a system of emotional healing. state and trait anxiety scores showed a decrease in posttest study phase in comparison with pretest in all experimental groups (p < 0.005), especially in those where aromatherapy and mindfulness meditation were used together. this was an open study of self-treatment with self-selected bach flower essences. the goal of this study was to verify whether association of aromatherapy with essential oils of satureja brevicalyx or satureja boliviana and mindfulness meditation can reduce anxiety levels in humans. although many botanicals have been proposed as putative remedies for anxiety symptoms, there has been a paucity of controlled trials of these remedies. participants' expectancy of the effect of flower essences, attitudes to complementary medicine, holistic health beliefs, absorption, and spirituality were measured prior to treatment. different plants belonging to the tilia genus have shown their efficacy in the treatment of anxiety but still little is known about the mechanism of action of their bud extracts. three rcts of bfrs for students with examination anxiety, and one rct of bfrs for children with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (adhd) showed no overall benefit in comparison to placebo. homeopathy and bach flower remedies (bfrs), historically-related complementary healing modalities classified as prescription/nonprescription drugs and over-the-counter homeopathic nutritional supplements, respectively, are compared with respect to indications, dosage philosophies, associated procedures, reported outcomes, safety profiles, and the possible operation of the placebo effect. |||",No
Does taking proton pump inhibitors (PPI) increase the risk of bone fractures?,Yes,"The use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) has been shown to be associated with an increased risk of bone fractures, particularly hip and spine fractures. This association has been observed in both epidemiological and clinical studies, with a higher risk noted in patients who have been on long-term PPI therapy, especially for a year or more. The exact mechanism behind this increased risk is not yet fully understood, but it is suggested that PPIs may impair bone quality and quantity. It is important to note that while the results of studies have been somewhat inconsistent, the majority indicate a moderate increase in fracture risk with PPI use.","epidemiological studies suggest an increased fracture risk in patients taking proton pump inhibitors (ppis) for long term. long-term treatment with proton pump inhibitors (ppis) is associated with an increased risk of fractures in the general population. recent studies revealed that long-term intake of proton pump inhibitor (ppi) increases the risk of vertebral or hip fracture; however, the exact mechanism for this is not known. epidemiological studies have associated proton pump inhibitor (ppi) therapy with osteoporotic fractures, but it is not clear if ppis directly cause osteoporosis. clinical studies indicate that proton pump inhibitors (ppis), used long-term in elderly patients, increase the risk of osteoporotic fractures, and decrease the anti-fracture efficacy of alendronate. recent studies have shown an association between proton-pump inhibitor use (ppi) and hip fracture. two recent studies have reported increased hip fracture rates with long-term proton pump inhibitor (ppi) use raising concerns about adverse effects of this class of drugs on mineral metabolism. proton pump inhibitor (ppi) use has been identified as a risk factor for hip and vertebral fractures. the use of proton pump inhibitors (ppis) seems to be related to increased fracture risk but the mechanism is unclear. proton pump inhibitors (ppis) are frequently prescribed to patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease; however, the number of bone fractures reportedly increased in these patients. to identify the relationship between proton-pump inhibitors (ppis) and the risk of fracture, we conducted an update meta-analysis of observational studies. proton pump inhibitors (ppis) are among the most frequently prescribed medications and may impair bone quality and quantity. many patients receive prolonged proton pump inhibitor (ppi) therapy for upper gastrointestinal disorders, but the long-term safety of ppis, particularly increased risk of hip and nonhip fractures, has been questioned. results showed that ppi use was associated with a modestly increased risk of hip, spine, and any-site fracture. many studies have investigated the association of proton-pump inhibitors (ppis) with fracture risk, but the results have been inconsistent. two recent studies have demonstrated increased hip fracture rates associated with ppi use. the risk of osteoporotic fracture increased with the duration of ppi use, especially when ppi was used for ≥1 year and regularly in the recent 1 year. pooled analysis showed that ppi use could moderately increase the risk of hip fracture [rr = 1.26, 95 % confidence intervals (cis) 1.16–1.36]. patients who regularly used ppi in the recent 1 year had a higher risk of osteoporotic fracture than exclusive h2ra users (or: 1.37, 95% ci: 1.26-1.50). results of this meta-analysis suggest that ppi may moderately increase the risk of any-site, hip, spine fracture. |||",Yes
Can hyposensitization by injections with allergy-causing pollen components help with hay fever?,Yes,"The context suggests that allergen injection immunotherapy, specifically grass pollen immunotherapy, is effective for summer hay fever. This treatment acts by inhibiting allergen-induced T lymphocyte and eosinophil recruitment and eosinophil activation in the target organ. The mechanism possibly involves protective local increases in Th1-type cells. Clinical improvement in hay fever is accompanied by a significant reduction in the immediate cutaneous response to grass pollen. Additionally, the context indicates that treatment with allergenic vaccines (immunotherapy) results in decreased symptoms of allergic rhinitis, decreased development of new allergies, and less asthma in the treated group compared with the untreated control group.","allergen injection immunotherapy is effective for summer hay fever and reduces cutaneous sensitivity to grass pollen. grass pollen injection immunotherapy is effective in patients with summer hay fever, although efficacy must be balanced against possible side effects. the results suggest that successful grass pollen immunotherapy for summer hay fever may act by inhibiting allergen-induced t lymphocyte and eosinophil recruitment and eosinophil activation in the target organ, possibly through a mechanism involving protective local increases in th1-type cells. clinical improvement in hay fever was accompanied by a greater than 10-fold reduction in the immediate cutaneous response to grass pollen (p = 0. grass pollen immunotherapy for the treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis ('summer hayfever') results in improvement in symptoms, a reduction in the early and late phase responses to allergen provocation and decreased tissue eosinophilia. the short-term and longterm benefits of allergen specific immunotherapy (sit), including potential prevention of exacerbation of disease from hay fever into asthma, are discussed. prophylactic allergen immunotherapy may be useful to reduce the risk of acute symptomatic attacks (hayfever). future pollen vaccines may consist of hypoallergenic recombinant allergens and t-helper cell type 1-inducing immunostimulatory adjuvants. this review describes the connection between hay fever and asthma in patients suffering from specific ige-mediated allergy. pollen allergens, the immunological mechanism of allergic inflammation and the mechanisms behind successful specific immunotherapy treatment of seasonal pollen allergy shall be discussed. this review deals with specific immunotherapy performed with pollen vaccines. in previous studies preseasonal local nasal immunotherapy (lnit) with moderate doses of aqueous ragweed extract (mean total dose 59 micrograms of age and 139 micrograms of age) was an effective treatment for ragweed hay fever; however, local adverse reactions during therapy were common. with recent developments in molecular biology of pollen allergens it has become feasible to produce modified hypoallergenic derivatives of recombinant allergens with abrogated or greatly reduced likelihood of anaphylactic side-effects as compared to extract-based treatments. survey of adult hay fever sufferers prescribed a non-sedating antihistamine and nasal steroid spray by their general practitioner. therapy for hay fever should begin with environmental control, because sometimes avoidance of allergens is all that is needed to adequately control symptoms. treatment with allergenic vaccines (immunotherapy) resulted in decreased symptoms of allergic rhinitis, decreased development of new allergies, and less asthma in the treated group, compared with the untreated control group. if not, useful medications include antihistamines, decongestants, combinations of the two, prescription nasal sprays, and allergy immunotherapy. however, because subjects often present to physicians with allergy symptoms during the pollen season, ""within-season"" initiation of specific immunotherapy is of special interest. international guidelines recommend that allergen-specific immunotherapy for pollen-induced rhinoconjunctivitis is initiated preseasonally. eliminating allergens from pollen released by plants is technically feasible, but might this interfere with the natural processes of pollination? |||",Yes
Can hyposensitization by means of drops or tablets administered under the tongue help with hay fever?,Yes,"The context indicates that while hyposensitization therapy is useful in some patients, the present regimens of oral hyposensitization cannot be recommended for hay fever. A double-blind placebo efficacy study failed to prove any beneficial effect of oral hyposensitization measured by symptom score, medication score, nasal provocation test, or skin prick test. Controlled studies proving a beneficial effect of oral hyposensitization are lacking. The total management of hay fever involves a multifaceted approach including environmental control, pharmacotherapy, and immunotherapy. Intranasal microemulsion treatment can attenuate allergen challenge-induced nasal symptoms and plasma exudation in allergic rhinitis. However, the context does not provide evidence to support the claim that hyposensitization by means of drops or tablets administered under the tongue can help with hay fever.","the possibility that oral hyposensitization might be an effective treatment of hay fever in the future is discussed, but it is concluded that the present regimens cannot be recommended. fifty-eight hay fever patients were admitted to a double-blind placebo efficacy study in oral hyposensitization. in 1900 it was claimed that oral administration of ragweed could be used for the hyposensitization of hay fever patients. hyposensitization therapy is useful in some patients. oral hyposensitization is still widely used in the treatment of allergic diseases, but controlled studies proving a beneficial effect are lacking. budesonide alone is a highly effective treatment for hay fever with few side effects. immunotherapy of allergic diseases first called desensitization or hyposensitization is based on the introduction by parenteral administration or perhaps also by mouth of the allergens which has been considered to be responsible by the clinical symptoms. the study failed to prove any beneficial effect of oral hyposensitization measured by symptom score, medication score, nasal provocation test or skin prick test. allergic rhinitis unresponsive to conservative therapy with antihistamines, decongestants, and environmental control may require the use of corticosteroids for symptomatic relief, even while hyposensitization is being carried out. if not, useful medications include antihistamines, decongestants, combinations of the two, prescription nasal sprays, and allergy immunotherapy. therapy for hay fever should begin with environmental control, because sometimes avoidance of allergens is all that is needed to adequately control symptoms. the total management of the patient with hay fever involves a multifaceted approach including environmental control, pharmacotherapy, and immunotherapy. intranasal microemulsion treatment can attenuate allergen challenge-induced nasal symptoms and plasma exudation in allergic rhinitis. it was decided to undertake controlled clinical trials to determine the safety and effectiveness of orally administered enteric-coated grass pollen tablets in patients with hay fever. while hay fever is a very common experience, its treatment in primary care setting has been little reported in controlled studies. additional heated humidification (hh) is the appropriate method when such complaints arise. such therapy may be given orally, intramuscularly, as a nasal aerosol, or by intraturbinal injection. some patients with allergic rhinitis (ar) may prefer a ""dry"" intranasal corticosteroid aerosol to avoid certain sensory perceptions such as the ""wet feeling in the nose"" and the ""dripping down the throat"" associated with aqueous nasal sprays. to improve the safety and efficacy of allergen extract-based immunotherapy, application of hypoallergens, i.e. prophylactic allergen immunotherapy may be useful to reduce the risk of acute symptomatic attacks (hayfever). |||",Yes

Does regular consumption of red meat or processed meat products increase the risk of colorectal cancer?,Yes,"Current evidence indicates that regular consumption of red meat or processed meat products is associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer. This association is supported by numerous epidemiological studies, which have found that diets high in red meat and processed meats are established risk factors for colorectal cancer. The frequency of red meat consumption, rather than the total amount consumed, has been linked to a higher risk of colorectal carcinogenesis. The potential role of meat cooking practices in this association is not yet fully understood, but it has been suggested that red meat may contribute to colorectal cancer risk by increasing exposure to n-nitroso compounds.","current evidence indicates that red and processed meat intake increases the risk of colorectal cancer; however, the association with colorectal adenomas is unclear. specific components of the diet such as red and processed meat have been associated with the risk of developing colorectal cancer. diets high in red meat and processed meats are established colorectal cancer (crc) risk factors. red meat intake is associated with elevated risk of developing colorectal cancer. studies have suggested that red and processed meat consumption elevate the risk of colon cancer; however, the relationship between red meat, as well as fat and protein, and distal colorectal cancer (crc) specifically is not clear. an increased risk for colorectal cancer has been consistently reported for long-time consumption of cooked and processed red meat. high intake of red meat or processed meat is associated with increased risk of colon cancer. consumption of red and processed meat has been associated with colorectal cancer in many but not all epidemiological studies; few studies have examined risk in relation to long-term meat intake or the association of meat with rectal cancer. the frequency of red meat consumption rather than total amount of consumed meat is associated with a higher risk of colorectal carcinogenesis. red and processed meat intake is convincingly associated with colorectal cancer (crc) incidence, but its impact on prognosis after crc diagnosis is unknown. although a large body of epidemiological research suggests that red meat intake increases the risk of colorectal cancer, little is known regarding how such an association varies across populations and types of red meat. our results demonstrate the potential value of examining long-term meat consumption in assessing cancer risk and strengthen the evidence that prolonged high consumption of red and processed meat may increase the risk of cancer in the distal portion of the large intestine. diets containing substantial amounts of red or preserved meats may increase the risk of various cancers, including colorectal cancer. high intake of red and processed meat reported in 1992/1993 was associated with higher risk of colon cancer after adjusting for age and energy intake but not after further adjustment for body mass index, cigarette smoking, and other covariates. although there is convincing evidence that red and processed meat intake increases the risk of colorectal cancer (crc), the potential role of meat cooking practices has not been established yet and could partly explain the current heterogeneity of results among studies. red meat may be associated with colorectal cancer by contributing to n-nitroso compound (noc) exposure. meat consumption, particularly of red and processed meat, is one of the most thoroughly studied dietary factors in relation to colon cancer. increased consumption of well-done red meat [odds ratio (or) 1.33 95% ci 0.98, 1.79] was associated with an (p = 0.04) increase in risk for rectal cancer among men. red meat consumption is associated with an increased colorectal cancer (crc) risk, which may be due to an increased endogenous formation of genotoxic n-nitroso compounds (nocs). red meat or meat-cooking methods such as frying and doneness level have been associated with an increased risk of colorectal and other cancers. |||",Yes

Does HPV vaccination reduce the risk of cervical cancer in girls?,Yes,"Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination has been shown to be an effective method for reducing the risk of cervical cancer in girls. The HPV vaccine has a significant impact on the incidence of cervical cancer, as it protects against HPV infections responsible for 70% of cervical cancer diagnoses. The vaccine is recommended for girls aged 11-26 years and has the potential to greatly reduce the incidence of cervical cancer. However, it is important to note that inequalities in cervical cancer may be increased following mass vaccination if girls with low vaccine uptake also have low future participation in cervical cancer screening. Additionally, preliminary research has indicated that women vaccinated against HPV may be less likely to undergo cervical cancer screening and engage in safe sexual behavior. Nonetheless, HPV vaccination reduces the risk of developing malignant lesions and is expected to change the dynamics of HPV transmission. The HPV vaccine significantly reduces the risk of HPV infection and subsequent cervical cancer diagnosis, and its underuse is linked to lack of knowledge of its effectiveness in preventing cervical cancer.","have studies proven the vaccine to be effective against the types of hpv associated with cervical cancer? human papillomavirus (hpv) vaccination and cervical screening prevent cervical cancer effectively. research shows that vaccination against human papillomavirus (hpv) infection is one of the most effective methods for reducing risk for cervical cancer; it also protects against other hpv-related cancers. the hpv vaccine has a very significant impact on the incidence of cervical cancer. human papillomavirus (hpv) vaccination, which is recommended for u.s. women and girls aged 11-26 years, effectively prevents cervical cancer. women who have been vaccinated for hpv are more likely to have been screened for cervical cancer. this review summarizes the evidence for the population impact of vaccines against oncogenic hpv types in reducing the prevalence of cervical precancerous lesions. the human papillomavirus (hpv) vaccine has the potential to greatly reduce the incidence of cervical cancer by protecting against hpv infections responsible for 70% of cervical cancer diagnoses. inequalities in cervical cancer may be increased following mass vaccination against the human papillomavirus (hpv) if girls with low vaccine uptake also have low future participation in cervical cancer screening. however, preliminary research has indicated that women vaccinated against hpv may be less likely to undergo cervical cancer screening and engage in safe sexual behaviour. hpv vaccination reduces the risk of developing malignant lesions and is expected to change the dynamics of hpv transmission. while the hpv vaccine significantly reduces the risk of hpv infection and subsequent cervical cancer diagnosis, underuse is linked to lack of knowledge of its effectiveness in preventing cervical cancer. this exploratory study examined the relationship between cervical cancer screening rates and hpv vaccination. effective vaccination is now available to prevent human papillomavirus (hpv), the most common sexually transmitted infection and the cause of cervical cancer, which is the second most common cancer among women worldwide. depending on uptake patterns, hpv vaccine could reduce existing disparities in cervical cancer. effective vaccination is now available to prevent human papillomavirus (hpv), the most common sexually transmitted infection and the cause of cervical cancer, the second most common cancer among women worldwide. vaccination is available to prevent human papillomavirus (hpv) types that cause cervical and other cancers. human papillomavirus vaccines prevent human papillomavirus infection and cervical precancers. cervical cancer control includes primary prevention through vaccination to prevent human papillomavirus (hpv) infection and secondary prevention through screening to detect and treat cervical precancerous lesions. human papillomavirus (hpv) infection is the primary risk factor for cervical cancer. |||",Yes
Is stool transplantation effective against recurrent Clostridium difficile infections ?,Yes,"Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has been shown to be an effective therapy for recurrent Clostridium difficile infections. The procedure involves the transfer of fecal matter from a healthy donor to a patient with recurrent C. difficile infection, aiming to restore the normal gut microbiota. Studies have demonstrated that FMT is highly effective, safe, and has practically no adverse effects. The procedure is also inexpensive and easy to perform, making it a viable alternative to antibiotic therapy. FMT has been shown to effectively reduce the recurrence of C. difficile infection and promote the restoration of normal gut microbiota.

Is Intermittent Fasting suitable for reducing excess weight as well as a conventional low calorie diet?,Yes,"Intermittent fasting (IF) has been proposed as a potential nutritional approach against obesity and metabolic diseases. It has emerged as an unconventional method to reduce body weight and improve metabolic health beyond simple calorie restriction. IF, characterized by 24-hour cycles alternating ad libitum feeding and fasting, has been shown to provide health benefits equivalent to prolonged fasting or caloric restriction. Recent studies have examined the effect of two IF approaches, alternate day fasting (ADF) and time-restricted eating (TRE), on weight loss and cardiometabolic risk factors. Although IF does not improve weight loss compared to continuous energy restriction (CER), it is a dietary intervention often used as an alternative to caloric restriction and has gained popularity due to its potential long-term health benefits. Fasting has been shown to decrease body weight, lean body, and fat content in both trained and untrained individuals. However, it is important to note that the long-term effects of chronic food restriction in humans are not yet clear, and the optimal diets for IF are unknown.

These findings suggest that acupuncture can trigger the onset of labor.","to estimate the clinical effectiveness of acupuncture to induce labor. induction of labor by acupuncture electro-stimulation was carried out in 31 patients. the aim of the present study is to investigate the effect of acupuncture to induce labor. the present study suggested that acupuncture applied at term of pregnancy seems to be effective in reducing the rate of labor induction which is performed for prolonged pregnancy at 41 + 5 weeks. two sessions of manual acupuncture, using local and distal acupuncture points, administered 2 days before a scheduled induction of labor did not reduce the need for induction methods or the duration of labor for women with a postterm pregnancy. the rate of labor induction significantly differed between acupuncture and observation groups (19.6% vs. 38%; p < 0.01); in particular, women receiving acupuncture showed a lower rate of induction, indicating prolonged pregnancy (5.3% vs. 10.1%; p < 0.01). to assess if acupuncture influences the onset of labour and the need for induction after prelabour rupture of membranes (prom) in nulliparous women. the present study demonstrated that acupuncture applied every odd day for one week seems ineffective in reducing the rate of labor induction performed for prolonged pregnancy at 41 + 5 weeks. the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of acupressure on the initiation of labor. acupuncture was applied in post-date pregnancies one week before a planned induction; the primary outcome was the rate of women submitted to labor induction for prolonged pregnancy at week 41 + 5. acupressure is a natural method that is used for inducing uterine contractions. acupuncture treatment used in nulliparas after prom showed no significant effect in reducing time to active labour or in reducing rate of inductions. according to the finding of this study, it seems that acupressure treatment was not effective in initiating labor as compared with the sham acupressure and the routine care groups. nevertheless, few studies have examined the impact of acupressure on the induction of labor. there was no change in wellbeing as a result of acupuncture, but it was considered positive to receive this kind of treatment while waiting for labour to begin. induction of labor refers to iatrogenic stimulation of uterine contractions before the onset of spontaneous labor as a therapeutic option when benefits of expeditious delivery outweigh the risks of continuing the pregnancy. this article reviews both nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic methods for labor induction, and offers suggestions for successful induction in various circumstances. traditional chinese medicine advocates the use of acupuncture to soften the cervix and induce uterine contractions. traditional chinese medicine advocates the use of acupuncture to soften the cervix and induce uterine contractions. to investigate between-group differences in time elapsed between inclusion and delivery, survival analysis was performed excluding women requiring labor induction: women receiving acupuncture showed a trend to deliver earlier than women in the observation group (p < 0.09). |||",No
Can switching to a higher fiber diet prevent colorectal cancer?,Yes,"The evidence suggests that a higher fiber diet, particularly from cereals and fruit, may reduce the risk of incident colorectal adenoma and distal colon cancer. This is supported by the observation of a reduced risk of distal colon cancer with increased total fiber intake (HR: 0.62; 95% CI: 0.41, 0.94; p-trend = 0.03). Additionally, elevated total dietary fiber intake was associated with a significantly reduced risk of incident distal colorectal adenoma (OR: 0.76; 95% CI: 0.63, 0.91; p-trend = 0.003). However, it is important to note that the association was not statistically significant for colorectal cancer overall (HR: 0.85; 95% CI: 0.70, 1.03; p-trend = 0.10). Nevertheless, the evidence suggests that a higher fiber diet may have a protective effect against colorectal cancer, particularly in the early stages of carcinogenesis.","dietary fiber has been associated with a reduced risk of colorectal cancer. contrary to previous recommendations, there is no strong evidence to suggest that fiber intake (including more fruits and vegetables) has any effect on colorectal cancer risk. although the association was not statistically significant for colorectal cancer overall (hr: 0.85; 95% ci: 0.70, 1.03; p-trend = 0.10), a reduced risk of distal colon cancer was observed with increased total fiber intake (hr: 0.62; 95% ci: 0.41, 0.94; p-trend = 0.03). many epidemiological and experimental studies have suggested that dietary fiber plays an important role in colon cancer prevention. whether the intake of dietary fiber can protect against colorectal cancer is a long-standing question of considerable public health import, but the epidemiologic evidence has been inconsistent. this large, prospective study within a population-based screening trial suggests that individuals consuming the highest intakes of dietary fiber have reduced risks of incident colorectal adenoma and distal colon cancer and that this effect of dietary fiber, particularly from cereals and fruit, may begin early in colorectal carcinogenesis. it has been hypothesized that increased intakes of fiber, vitamin c, and beta carotene could decrease the risk of colorectal cancer. if causality is assumed, we estimate that risk of colorectal cancer in the u.s. population could be reduced about 31% (50,000 cases annually) by an average increase in fiber intake from food sources of about 13 g/d, corresponding to an average increase of about 70%. this article reviews the current knowledge concerning the mechanisms via which dietary fiber protects against colon cancer. in analyses of fiber from different food sources, only fiber from grains was associated with a lower risk of colorectal cancer (multivariate rr(q5-q1): 0.86; 95% ci: 0.76, 0.98; p for trend = 0.01). elevated total dietary fiber intake was associated with a significantly reduced risk of incident distal colorectal adenoma (orhighest vs. lowest tertile of intake: 0.76; 95% ci: 0.63, 0.91; p-trend = 0.003) but not recurrent adenoma (p-trend = 0.67). the objective was to investigate the relation between dietary fiber and whole-grain food intakes and invasive colorectal cancer in the prospective national institutes of health-aarp diet and health study. this analysis provides substantive evidence that intake of fiber-rich foods is inversely related to risk of cancers of both the colon and rectum. dietary fibers are considered to reduce the risk of colon cancer as they are converted to short chain fatty acids by the presence of anaerobic bacteria in the intestine, but imbalanced diet and high fat consumption may promote tumor formation at different sites, including the large bowel via increased bacterial enzymes activity. recommendations to increase consumption of fiber-containing food and decrease the intake of dietary fat should form the basis of a diet that is unlikely to do harm, and may have the potential for reducing the development of colon cancer, in humans. in this large prospective cohort study, total dietary fiber intake was not associated with colorectal cancer risk, whereas whole-grain consumption was associated with a modest reduced risk. support for a protective role for certain dietary fibers in the etiology of colon cancer has come from nutritional epidemiologic studies. total dietary fiber intake was not associated with colorectal cancer. the claim that populations at low risk for colon cancer generally consume a more fiber-rich diet than those at high risk, has been used to postulate a protective role for this group of substances. the objective was to prospectively evaluate the association between dietary fiber intake and the risk of incident and recurrent colorectal adenoma and incident colorectal cancer. |||",No
Can perineal massage during pregnancy help prevent birth injury in first-time mothers?,Yes,"The evidence suggests that antenatal perineal massage is associated with a lower risk of severe perineal trauma and postpartum complications.

Does flu vaccination reduce the likelihood of getting the flu (influenza)?,Yes,"The context suggests that flu vaccination is associated with a reduced risk of influenza illness. Studies have shown that vaccination can provide meaningful protection against laboratory-confirmed influenza infections, with an overall risk reduction of up to 55.0%. The model also indicates that even in the presence of vaccine interference, revaccination can reduce the influenza attack rate and provide individual benefits. Furthermore, vaccination in both the current and previous seasons was associated with a higher vaccine effectiveness against hospitalization with influenza than vaccination in either single season. Therefore, it can be concluded that flu vaccination reduces the likelihood of getting the flu.","higher influenza vaccine dose has been associated with reduced risk of influenza illness. improving flu vaccination rates in the general population is an important and effective strategy toward reducing morbidity, mortality, and the cost of seasonal influenza. this study examines the relationship between the risk of flu infection and the probability of getting vaccinated. while repeated influenza vaccination reduces seroresponse, vaccine effectiveness is not always reduced. the flu, a condition that can affect the elderly by increasing the risk of serious complications can be prevented through vaccination. influenza vaccination of hiv1-seropositive subjects generally protects against specific flu, especially if the patients have not reached a too-advanced stage. influenza vaccination gave meaningful protection against laboratory-confirmed influenza in people with asthma across all seasons. the model shows that, even in the presence of vaccine interference, revaccination reduces the influenza attack rate and provides individual benefits. vaccination in both the current and previous seasons was associated with a higher ve against hospitalization with influenza than vaccination in either single season. influenza vaccination can potentially reduce the incidence of influenza in people with asthma, but uptake remains persistently low, partially reflecting concerns about vaccine effectiveness (ve). influenza is one of the most common causes of human morbidity and mortality that is preventable by vaccination. annual influenza vaccination is a key to preventing widespread influenza infections. strategies to boost influenza vaccine uptake have the potential to substantially reduce influenza-triggered asthma attacks. vaccination was associated with an overall 55.0% (95% confidence interval [ci], 45.8-62.7) risk reduction of laboratory-confirmed influenza infections in people with asthma over 6 seasons. there was a significant association between vaccination interval and influenza result in the main effects model. the most effective way to prevent influenza and its spread is vaccination which requires good vaccination coverage of vulnerable groups and health professionals in contact with these patient groups. vaccination is considered the most effective preventive measure against influenza transmission, yet vaccination rates during the 2009/10 influenza a/h1n1 pandemic were low across the world, with the majority of people declining to receive the vaccine. influenza vaccination aims to prevent infection by influenza virus and reduce associated morbidity and mortality; however, vaccine effectiveness (ve) can be modest, especially for subtype a(h3n2). recent reports of influenza vaccine effectiveness (ve) indicate that vaccination in prior years may reduce ve in the current season, suggesting vaccine interference. vaccination can decrease the morbidity and mortality caused by influenza, yet vaccination rates remain low, especially among minority groups. |||",Yes
Can therapy with the radioactive gas radon noticeably alleviate pain in rheumatism-related joint inflammation (rheumatoid arthritis)?,No,"The existing trials suggest a positive effect of radon therapy on pain in rheumatic diseases.

Does frankincense help with painful joint wear (osteoarthritis)?,Yes,"The provided context does not contain information regarding the use of frankincense for treating osteoarthritis. Therefore, it is not possible to determine if frankincense is effective in relieving joint pain and improving function in chronic osteoarthritis based on the given information.

While definitive conclusions cannot be drawn regarding the use of cinnamon as an antidiabetic therapy, it does possess antihyperglycemic properties and potential to reduce postprandial blood glucose levels.","treatment of diabetic subjects with cinnamon demonstrated an improvement in blood glucose concentrations and insulin sensitivity but the underlying mechanisms remained unclear. cinnamon consumption has been found to associate with the attenuation of diabetes mellitus. in conclusion, our study indicates that cinnamon supplementation is able to significantly improve blood glucose control in chinese patients with type 2 diabetes. previous studies of patients with type 2 diabetes showed that cinnamon lowers fasting serum glucose, triacylglycerol, and ldl- and total cholesterol concentrations. research has shown that adding cinnamon to diet can help to lower the glucose level. the cinnamon extract seems to have a moderate effect in reducing fasting plasma glucose concentrations in diabetic patients with poor glycaemic control. the aim of this study was to determine the effect of cinnamon on the glucose level in blood. we hypothesized cinnamon should be effective in improving blood glucose control in chinese patients with type 2 diabetes. the purpose of this study was to determine whether cinnamon lowers hba1c in patients with type 2 diabetes. taking cinnamon could be useful for lowering serum hba1c in type 2 diabetics with hba1c >7.0 in addition to usual care. it has long been believed that an intake of cinnamon (cinnamomum zeylanicum) alleviates diabetic pathological conditions. the aim of this review was to examine the results of randomized controlled clinical trials of cinnamon and evaluate the therapeutic potential amongst patients with diabetes and insulin-resistant patients, particularly the ability to reduce blood glucose levels and inhibit protein glycation. this study systematically reviewed and synthesized evidence on the efficacy of cinnamon for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (t2dm) and pre-diabetes patients. according to previous studies, cinnamon may have a positive effect on the glycaemic control and the lipid profile in patients with diabetes mellitus type 2. the decrease in plasma glucose correlated significantly with the baseline concentrations, indicating that subjects with a higher initial plasma glucose level may benefit more from cinnamon intake. cinnamon has been used as a dietary component and in the management of diabetes mellitus. cinnamon's effects on blood glucose have been the subject of many clinical and animal studies; however, the issue of cinnamon intake's effect on fasting blood glucose (fbg) in people with type 2 diabetes and/or prediabetes still remains unclear. whilst definitive conclusions cannot be drawn regarding the use of cinnamon as an antidiabetic therapy, it does possess antihyperglycaemic properties and potential to reduce postprandial blood glucose levels. results showed that using certain amount of cinnamon for 60 days did not change the glucose level of diabetic patients. in addition, fasting blood glucose levels and glucose tolerance were greatly improved in ob/ob mice due to cinnamon extracts, while insulin secretion was unaltered. |||",No
Does sitting for long periods shorten the lifespan?,Yes,"The study suggests that prolonged sitting was not independently associated with lung cancer incidence. However, those who sit for prolonged periods and are physically inactive have an increased incidence of lung cancer compared to those who sit less and are physically active. This implies that physical inactivity, rather than prolonged sitting itself, may contribute to a shorter lifespan. Furthermore, the study found no association between total sitting time daily and the incidence of lung cancer overall and histologic subtypes. Therefore, based on the given context, it can be concluded that sitting for long periods does not directly shorten the lifespan. However, it is important to note that physical inactivity, which may be associated with prolonged sitting, can have a negative impact on health and lifespan.","background: prolonged sitting as a major sedentary behavior potentially contributes to illness, but its relation with lung cancer risk is unclear. prolonged sitting can be presented in physically active or inactive individuals. the combination of prolonged sitting and physical inactivity might increase the risk of lung cancer. conclusions: our study suggested that prolonged sitting was not independently associated with lung cancer incidence. compared with participants sitting < 8 h daily and being physically active, those sitting ≥8 h daily (prolonged sitting) and being physically inactive had an increased incidence of lung cancer (overall: adjusted hr = 1.44, 95% ci: 1.07-1.94; small cell lung cancer: adjusted hr = 2.58, 95% ci: 1.23-5.41). we therefore aimed to prospectively examine if total sitting time daily itself or in combination with physical activity is associated with lung cancer incidence overall and histologic types. ltl shortening has correlated with decreased longevity, dementia, and other age-associated processes. if telomere length is a valuable biomarker of ageing, then telomere shortening should be associated with worse physical performance, an ageing trait, but evidence for such an association is lacking. telomere shortening to a critical length can trigger aging and shorter life spans in mice and humans by a mechanism that involves induction of a persistent dna damage response at chromosome ends and loss of cellular viability. human leukocyte telomere length (ltl) decreases with age and shorter ltl has previously been associated with increased prospective mortality. we found that the telomere shortening rate, but not the initial telomere length alone, is a powerful predictor of species life span. telomeres are involved in cellular ageing and shorten with increasing age. telomere length is a marker of cell aging, since shorter telomeres and a higher rate of telomere shortening with time are associated with poorer health status and survival. low socio-economic status (ses) is associated with a shortened life expectancy, but its effect on aging is unknown. we explored a possibility of such a limitation of maximal life-span by the age-related alteration of elastin, consisting in ca-accumulation, lipid deposition and elastolytic degradation. total sitting time daily was not associated with the incidence of lung cancer overall and histologic subtypes. human leukocyte dna telomere length (ltl) has been shown to shorten during aging. some evidence points at an association between longer endogenous estrogen exposure (length of reproductive years of life) and greater telomere length and lower telomerase activity. whereas shortening of leukocyte telomeres might be an important measure of cellular ageing, there is little evidence that it is a strong biomarker for physical performance. telomere length shortens with aging, and short telomeres have been linked to a wide variety of pathologies. |||",Yes
Does mammography screening reduce the risk of dying from breast cancer in certain age groups?,Yes,"Mammography screening has been shown to reduce mortality from breast cancer in women aged 50 to 69 years, with a reduction in risk of about 23% to 30%. This is supported by randomized controlled trials and is widely accepted. The benefit is less pronounced in women aged 40 to 49 years, with a reduction in risk of about 16% after 10 years of screening. However, the absolute number of deaths prevented by screening in this age group is much less than in older women due to the lower incidence of breast cancer and the smaller and delayed potential benefit. Women in their 70s may also have a small benefit from screening mammography, but overdiagnosis and competing causes of death increase in this age group. Therefore, mammography screening reduces the risk of dying from breast cancer in certain age groups, with the greatest benefit seen in women aged 50 to 69 years.","screening for breast cancer with mammography in women aged 50 years or more has been shown to reduce mortality from breast cancer. mammographic screening has been shown to reduce breast cancer mortality in women over the age of 50 years, and to a lesser extent in younger women. there is little controversy that mammography reduces the risk of dying from breast cancer by about 23% among women between the ages of 50 and 69 years, although the harms associated with false-positive results and overdiagnosis limit the net benefit of mammography. mammography screening of women aged 50-70 years for breast cancer has proven to be effective in reducing breast cancer mortality. mammographic screening is one worthwhile way of reducing deaths from breast cancer among women diagnosed in ages 50-69. in randomized controlled trials, screening mammography has been shown to reduce mortality from breast cancer about 25% to 30% among women aged 50 to 69 years after only five to six years from the initiation of screening. screening for breast cancer using mammography alone, or mammography plus physical examination of the breasts, reduces mortality from breast cancer in women age 50-69. mammographic screening reduces mortality in breast cancer. while new data support a 16% reduction in breast cancer mortality for 40- to 49-year-old women after 10 years of screening, the net benefit is less compelling in part because of the lower incidence of breast cancer in this age group and because mammography is less sensitive and specific in women younger than 50 years. given that the incidence of breast cancer for women aged 40 to 49 years is lower and the potential benefit from mammography screening smaller and delayed, the absolute number of deaths prevented by screening women aged 40 to 49 years is much less than in screening women aged 50 to 69 years. in randomized trials, screening mammography has been shown to reduce breast cancer mortality. mammography screening is increasingly promoted as a means to avoid death from breast cancer. the benefits that have been realized from mammography screening in overall breast cancer mortality and diagnosis of earlier stage cancers are also reviewed. mammographic screening is effective in reducing mortality from breast cancer. the national breast screening study was designed to show whether screening with mammography and physical examination of the breasts reduces mortality from breast cancer in volunteers aged 40-49 and to determine the incremental effect of mammography over and above any effect of physical examination in women aged 50-59.in spite of the high incidence of breast cancer in these two age groups, both physicians and the public have shown reluctance to support the trial. women in their 70s may have a small benefit from screening mammography, but overdiagnosis increases in this age group as do competing causes of death. because the absolute benefit of screening women aged 40 to 49 years is small and there is concern that the harms are substantial, the focus should be to help these women make informed decisions about screening mammography by educating them of their true risk of breast cancer and the potential benefits and risks of screening. the reduction in breast cancer mortality is greater for women aged over 50 at screening than for women aged under 50. mammography, as the primary screening modality, has facilitated a substantial decrease in breast cancer-related mortality in the general population. the issue of whether to screen women aged 40-49 for breast cancer is debated usually in terms of the potential mortality reduction achievable by the application of screening in this age group. |||",Yes
Does the intake of omega-3 fatty acids improve the clinical picture in multiple sclerosis (MS) or does this inhibit progression of the disease?,No,"The intake of omega-3 fatty acids has been shown to improve the clinical picture in multiple sclerosis (MS) and inhibit the progression of the disease. Omega-3 fatty acids, including EPA, DPA, and DHA, have been found to have beneficial effects on reducing the relapsing rate, inflammatory markers, and improving the quality of life for MS patients. Recent trial studies have shown that omega-3 supplementation can beneficially improve scores on the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), which is considered a gold standard for measuring disability and disease severity in MS patients, as well as reducing neuroinflammation. Omega-3 fatty acids are suggested to have anti-inflammatory properties that might be beneficial in MS. Dietary supplementation containing a variety of nutrients, including omega-3 fatty acids, has been shown to improve the quality of life, severity of disease symptoms, and functionality in MS patients.","combined omega-3 fatty acid and vitamin d supplementation may improve multiple sclerosis (ms) by correcting metabolic abnormalities and attenuating oxidative stress and inflammation. these studies showed the beneficial roles of fish oil supplementation and omega-3 fatty acids in improving the quality of life of ms patients. this work aimed to review the literature systematically for evidence on the effect of omega-3 fatty acids (epa, dpa and dha) on ms progression in adults. diet especially fish oils and omega-3 has been found to play an important role in ms. conclusion: omega-3 and fish oils supplementations have beneficial effects on reducing the relapsing rate, inflammatory markers, and improving the quality of life for ms patients. recent trial studies have shown that omega-3 supplementation can beneficially improve scores on the expanded disability status scale (edss), which is considered a gold standard for measuring disability and disease severity in multiple sclerosis (ms) patients, as well as reducing neuroinflammation. ω-3 fatty acids are suggested to have anti-inflammatory properties that might be beneficial in ms. we aimed to explore the relationship between serum levels of inflammation markers and mri activity in patients with relapsing remitting ms, as well as the effect of ω-3 fatty acids on these markers. overall, taking ω-3 fatty acid and vitamin d supplements for 12 wk by patients with ms had beneficial effects on edss and metabolic status. this study aimed to determine the effects of ω-3 fatty acid and vitamin d cosupplementation on the disability score and metabolic status of patients with ms. serum levels of cxcl16, mmp-9, and osteoprotegerin reflect disease activity in ms, but are not affected by ω-3 fatty acid treatment. our results suggest that dietary supplementation containing a variety of nutrients can improve the quality of life, severity of disease symptoms, and functionality in ms patients. the present systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the effect of omega-3 supplementation on edss and cytokines in ms. a systematic search was performed on pubmed, scopus and cochrane library up to october 2018. the aim of the present work was to evaluate the efficacy of fish oil supplementation on serum proinflammatory cytokine levels, oxidative stress markers, and disease progression in ms. 50 patients with relapsing-remitting ms were enrolled. for many years, medical interest in the relationship between nutrition and multiple sclerosis (ms) has focused largely on aetiology and the influence of dietary fat on the rate and severity of disease. to assess the effect of a low-fat diet with antioxidant supplementation on biochemical markers of institutionalized patients with progressive forms of multiple sclerosis. fish oil consumption has neuroprotective, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects in patients with relapsing-recurrent ms (rr-ms). according to the literature, broad-spectrum dietary supplementation including a variety of nutrients, polysaccharides, and compounds may improve the quality of life, functionality, and symptom severity in people with ms. fish oil supplementation is highly effective in reducing the levels of cytokines and nitric oxide catabolites in patients with relapsing-remitting ms. in the present study, we tested the hypothesis that omega 3 fatty acids supplement reduced pro-inflammatory functions in vitro and in vivo. we performed a prospective cohort study in 85 relapsing remitting ms patients who participated in a randomized clinical trial of ω-3 fatty acids versus placebo (the ofams study). |||",No
Can Botox injections prevent migraine attacks?,Yes,"The efficacy of Botulinum Toxin Type A (Botox) in preventing migraine attacks has been investigated in several clinical studies. These studies have shown that Botox injections can significantly reduce migraine frequency, severity, and the need for acute medication. The treatment has been found to be safe and effective for patients with chronic migraine and other headache disorders. The mechanism of action is not fully understood, but it is known that the relaxation of the corrugator muscles is not solely responsible for the pain relief. Instead, Botox may have multiple targets in relieving migraine pain. In clinical trials, prevention of migraine attacks for 3 months or more has been observed in some patients following Botox injections.","to determine if botulinum toxin type a (bont-a) injections can reduce the frequency and severity of migraines. recent studies suggest botulinum toxin type a is effective in preventing migraine. scalp injection of botulinum toxin type a (bt-a) into the superficial musculature has evoked interest in the management of migraine headache. botulinum toxins are promising preventive treatments for patients with moderate to severe episodic and chronic migraine and chronic daily headache. an open-label, noncontrolled study of botulinum toxin type a suggested benefits for patients with migraine. compared with vehicle treatment, subjects in the 25-u botulinum toxin type a treatment group showed significantly fewer migraine attacks per month, a reduced maximum severity of migraines, a reduced number of days using acute migraine medications, and reduced incidence of migraine-associated vomiting. pericranial injection of botulinum toxin type a, 25 u, was found to be a safe treatment that significantly reduced migraine frequency, migraine severity, acute medication usage, and associated vomiting. to assess the safety and efficacy of botulinum toxin type a (botox; allergan, inc) in the prevention of migraine. botulinum toxin type a (bont-a) has been reported as an effective treatment for chronic migraine. the purpose of this study was to test whether the efficacy of prophylactic treatment with botulinum toxin a (btx-a) on migraine frequency is related to the individual perception of the pain and its directionality, namely, exploding, imploding, or ocular migraine headache. in clinical trials, prevention of migraine attacks for 3 months or more has been seen in some patients following bt-a scalp injections. botulinum toxin type a (bont/a) is an approved treatment for chronic migraine and has been shown to be effective in reducing number, days, and severity of headache in other headache disorders. migraine response to botulinum toxin type a treatment did not correlate with the denervation pattern. reported efficacy of extracranial botulinum toxin (bont) in treating migraine is surprising since a local extracranial effect of bont cannot account for its effect upon meningeal input. although botulinum toxin type a (bt-a) is approved for chronic migraine treatment, its site and mechanism of action are still elusive. efficacy of botulinum toxin type a (bont-a) in migraine has been investigated in clinical studies but the mechanism of action remains unexplored. during a 1-month baseline period and for 3 months following injection, subjects kept daily diaries in which they recorded migraine frequency, migraine severity, and the occurrence of migraine-associated symptoms. relaxation of the corrugator muscles is not solely responsible for the pain relief in migraine patients treated with botulinum toxin type a. relaxation of the corrugator muscle may be one of multiple targets of botulinum toxin type a in relieving migraine pain. clinical and experimental studies with botulinum toxin in the last decade have advanced our understanding of headache and other pain states. |||",Yes
Does taking probiotics facilitate weight loss to any significant degree?,No,"The available evidence suggests that the impact of probiotics on weight loss is not definitive. While some studies indicate that probiotics may contribute to a reduction in body weight, others report limited or no significant effect. The role of probiotics in altering gut microbiota and gut hormones associated with appetite regulation is also under investigation. Furthermore, the effectiveness and safety of probiotics for the treatment of obesity have been reported for only a few strains. Therefore, it is not possible to definitively conclude that taking probiotics facilitates weight loss to any significant degree.","both dio and nw groups with probiotic supplementation maintained an insignificant weight gain while the control groups gained significant weight (p < 0.05). because gut microbiota has recently attracted much attention as an environmental factor involved in the development of obesity, probiotics may be useful in preventing and/or improving obesity and its related disorders. very long-term treatment with a lactobacillus probiotic preparation suppressed weight loss in the elderly. there is interest whether probiotics have an effect on obesity, but the effectiveness and safety of only a few probiotics for the treatment of obesity have been reported. however, there are mixed results on whether probiotics could impact the gut microbiome and/or help to decrease liver fat and obesity outcomes. recently, it has been suggested that probiotics and in particular lactobacilli are contributing to human obesity. recently, probiotics have shown promise in treating metabolic disease due to improved strain selection and delivery technologies. several studies have reported limited or no reduction in serum cholesterol in response to probiotic formulations. deciphering the exact underlying mechanism of the weight loss and lowering nociception effect of the probiotic applied in this study require further investigation. recent reports suggest that probiotics may have a role in regulating the motility of the digestive tract. previous meta-analyses reported that probiotics improve the effectiveness of helicobacter pylori (h. pylori) eradication during antibiotic therapy, while results regarding a possible reduction of side effects remained inconclusive. in this study, two probiotic candidates were screened for their effects on metabolic health using the diet-induced obesity (dio) mouse model. furthermore, when looking at animal models of obesity, it even appears the lactobacilli may potentially contribute to a reduction in body weight. this study aimed to determine whether a probiotic supplement (vsl#3® ) intervention altered gut microbiota and/or gut hormones associated with appetite regulation. in liver health, the main benefits of probiotics might occur through preventing the production and/or uptake of lipopolysaccharides in the gut, and therefore reducing levels of low-grade inflammation. the results of this study suggest a protective effect of probiotics on nociception circuits, which propose a direct result of the weight reduction or an indirect result of anti-inflammatory properties of the probiotics. probiotic bacteria have well-established beneficial effects in the management of diarrhoeal diseases. however, evidence for the role of eps-producing probiotics in the management of obesity and associated conditions is scarce and the role of the microbiota is unclear. although patients treated with probiotics had significantly less clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea than patients treated with placebo (18.6 vs. 5.8%; p = 0.02), the duration of diarrhea per episode was not different between groups (13.2 ± 7.4 vs. 9.8 ± 4.9 d; p = 0.39). newer evidence suggests that probiotics have the potential to reduce the risk of developing inflammatory bowel diseases and intestinal bacterial overgrowth after gut surgery. |||",No
Does the full moon have a negative effect on sleep duration?,No,"The context suggests that the full moon may have a negative effect on sleep duration, particularly in women. Separate analyses for men and women indicated that in women, total sleep time, stage 4 sleep, and REM sleep were reduced when sleep occurred close to the full moon. However, in men, REM duration increased around the full moon. The interaction between lunar class and sex was significant for total sleep time, stage 4 sleep, and REM sleep. No significant main effect for the factor lunar class was observed for any of the objective sleep parameters and subjective sleep quality, but some significant interactions were observed. These findings suggest that the full moon may have a negative effect on sleep duration, particularly in women.","recently, evidence has emerged that the phases of the moon may modulate subjective sleep quality and polysomnographically assessed sleep structure in humans. separate analyses for men and women indicated that in women total sleep time, stage 4 sleep and rem sleep were reduced when sleep occurred close to full moon, whereas in men rem duration increased around full moon. previous literature suggests that human behaviour and physiology are somehow altered by the moon-cycle, with particular emphasis on poorer sleep quality and increased aggressive behaviour during full moon. there is ongoing debate on whether the full moon is associated with sleep and dreaming. we aimed to explore further the putative effects of circa-lunar periodicity (~29.5 days) on subjective and objective parameters of human sleep in a retrospective analysis. there is a long-held belief in the association between the full moon and extremes of human behaviour and adverse health consequences. the potential effect of a full moon on psychogenic nonepileptic events has not been as well studied, despite what anecdotal accounts from most epilepsy monitoring unit (emu) staff would suggest. to evaluate the impact of the lunar phase, and in particular, the full moon phase, on the incidence and outcomes among st-elevation myocardial infarction (stemi) cases undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (pci). these data provide limited evidence for an effect of lunar phase on human sleep. the findings suggest that the full moon or new moon or the gravitational pull have no effect on football injuries. the interaction between lunar class and sex was significant for total sleep time, stage 4 sleep and rapid eye movement (rem) sleep. no significant main effect for the factor lunar class was observed for any of the objective sleep parameters and subjective sleep quality but some significant interactions were observed. studies of the effect of a full moon on seizures have yielded mixed results, despite a continuing prevailing belief regarding the association of lunar phase with human behavior. psychological factors might explain why some persons associate a full moon with increased dream recall. this paper reviews the effects of suboptimal timing of the sleep/wake cycle on sleep, alertness and well-being. we found a significant negative correlation between the mean number of seizures and the fraction of the moon illuminated by the sun (rho=-0.09, p<0.05) in 1571 seizures recorded in a dedicated epilepsy inpatient unit over 341 days. travel across time zones disrupts circadian rhythms causing increased daytime sleepiness, impaired alertness and sleep disturbance. we investigated whether circadian misalignment was associated with adverse sleep outcomes before (preflight) and during spaceflight missions aboard the international space station (iss). subgroup analysis confirmed no difference in outcomes during the full moon compared to a composite of other lunar phases.kaplan-meier survival estimates showed similar 30-day outcomes across lunar phases (p = 0.35) and when comparing full moon to a composite of other lunar phases (p = 0.45). this reduction in the quality and duration of sleep has been attributed to a change in the phase relationship between the work period and the circadian system, timing the propensity for sleep and wakefulness. |||",No

Does taking vitamin D improve symptoms in the most common form of psoriasis?,No,"The context suggests that vitamin D, in various forms, has been found to be beneficial in the treatment of psoriasis. Topical application of vitamin D analogues is a well-established and effective treatment for psoriasis vulgaris, the most common form of psoriasis. Furthermore, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, a hormonally active form of vitamin D3, has been reported to stimulate epidermal differentiation and effectively treat psoriatic lesions. The literature review also indicates that oral vitamin D supplementation can improve disease severity in patients with psoriasis. However, it is important to note that the serum level of vitamin D did not correlate with the severity of psoriasis in one study. Nonetheless, the overall evidence suggests that taking vitamin D, either topically or orally, can improve symptoms in the most common form of psoriasis.","vitamin d could have important immunomodulatory effects in psoriasis. in addition, oral vitamin d improves psoriatic arthropathy. vitamin d analogues have been found to be effective in treating the skin lesions of psoriasis. several reports have appeared in the literature suggesting that vitamin d metabolites and analogues may be useful for the treatment of psoriasis. vitamin d as a topical treatment has become one of the mainstays for treatment of psoriasis vulgaris. phototherapy and activated froms of vitamin d help clear psoriasis. vitamin d also has an effect on t helper cells, which have a major role in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. there are several factors that can affect psoriasis and vitamin d is one of the recently arisen. but a review of the literature on oral vitamin d as a treatment for psoriasis reveals that this treatment is efficacious. hence, the aim of the present study was to systematically review and meta-analyze the efficacy of oral vitamin d supplementation in improving disease severity of patients with psoriasis. psoriatic patients as a population are at increased risk of developing adverse health complications such as cardiovascular disease, and oral vitamin d may prove to be of benefit in this population. topical vitamin d analogues offer a new, effective, more convenient and generally well-tolerated option for the treatment of psoriasis. vitamin d, calcitriol, and its analogues are successfully used for psoriasis therapy. serum level of vitamin d did not correlate with the severity of psoriasis in our study. 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin d3 [1,25-(oh)2d3], a hormonally active form of vitamin d3, has been reported to stimulate epidermal differentiation and to be an effective treatment of psoriatic lesions. vitamin d deficiency may be common in patients with psoriasis, especially in winter. psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease of unknown aetiology, and an active form of vitamin d(3) (1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin d(3)) and its analogues (vd3as) are widely used topical reagents for psoriasis treatment. in the logistic regression analysis, vitamin d deficiency was associated with psoriasis independently of age, sex, body mass index, calcium, pth levels and season of blood sampling. psoriasis is a chronic, systemic disease with the beneficial effect of topical vitamin d3 analogs, known for a long time. a favorable effect of oral vitamin d supplementation in patients with psoriasis could not be verified. |||",No
Does taking fish oil with omega-3 fatty acids improve the symptoms of various forms of psoriasis more than a placebo???,No,"The evidence suggests that fish oil supplementation may not significantly improve the symptoms of various forms of psoriasis more than a placebo. A study with 18 patients with stable, plaque psoriasis found no significant reduction in the severity of psoriasis when assessed by the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index score. Additionally, monotherapy with fish oil or omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids had no effect on the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index score, lesion area, or pruritus.

Does following a Mediterranean diet decrease the likelihood of cardiovascular disease in people at high risk?,Yes,"The Mediterranean diet has been consistently associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in numerous epidemiological and clinical studies. This dietary pattern is characterized by a high intake of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts, and olive oil, as well as moderate consumption of fish and poultry, and low consumption of red and processed meats, dairy products, and sweets. The Mediterranean diet has been shown to improve multiple cardiovascular risk factors, including blood pressure, lipid profile, and inflammation markers. Furthermore, greater adherence to this diet has been linked to a lower risk of CVD events, such as myocardial infarction, heart failure, and ischemic stroke. Therefore, it is plausible that following a Mediterranean diet could decrease the likelihood of CVD in people at high risk.","mediterranean diet is associated with a reduced risk for cardiovascular disease (cvd). a mediterranean dietary pattern has been associated with lower cardiovascular (cv) mortality. there is evidence from epidemiologic studies and clinical trials demonstrating that the mediterranean dietary pattern reduces the risk of many chronic diseases, including cardiovascular disease (cvd), and the attendant risk factors. a mediterranean diet has been associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality. the mediterranean diet and more specifically certain meats, fruits, vegetables, and olive oil found in certain parts of the mediterranean region have been associated with a decreased cardiovascular and diabetes risk. greater adherence to the mediterranean diet was associated with reduced fatal and non fatal cv events, especially in individuals at low cv risk, thus suggesting the usefulness of promoting this nutritional pattern in particular in healthier individuals. a mediterranean dietary pattern has been associated with a reduced risk of coronary heart disease, as well as a reduction of oxidative stress, but studies indicating possible interactions between food intake and inflammatory mediators production at specific sites are lacking. adherence to the mediterranean diet reduces the risk of all-cause and cardiovascular (cv) mortality and the incidence of cv events. better adherence to a mediterranean diet was associated with lower risk of mi, hf and ischemic stroke. there is an association between a greater adherence to a mediterranean diet and a reduced risk of developing chronic diseases. several epidemiological and clinical studies have evaluated the effects of a mediterranean diet (med-diet) on total cardiovascular mortality, and all concluded that adherence to the traditional med-diet is associated with reduced cardiovascular risk. adherence to the mediterranean diet (med-diet) is associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease (cvd). this finding could provide a novel mechanistic explanation for the recognized lower coronary risk associated with a mediterranean diet. several epidemiological studies have observed that following a traditional mediterranean diet reduces overall and cardiovascular mortality, as well as the incidence of chronic diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. the aim was to examine a mediterranean diet in relation to incidence of myocardial infarction (mi), hf and stroke types in a swedish prospective cohort. the traditional mediterranean diet (md) is reportedly associated with lower risk of major chronic diseases and long considered to contribute to the reduced rates of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events and to the highest life expectancy in adults who lived near the mediterranean sea. these results confirm that decreased lpo is a plausible mechanism linking a mediterranean diet to reduced cardiovascular disease risk. mediterranean diet gradually induced a significant reduction in total cholesterol (tc), ldl-c, triglycerides, high sensitivity c-reactive protein (hscrp), blood pressure and ecvd risk (24-32%). analyses of intermediate markers demonstrated beneficial effects of the mediterranean diet on blood pressure, lipid profile, lipoprotein particles, oxidative stress and inflammation markers and carotid atherosclerosis. adherence to the mediterranean diet protects against diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. |||",Yes
Does the probability of dying from cardiovascular disease decrease in people who have already had a heart attack?,Yes,"Justification: The context suggests that the probability of dying from cardiovascular disease decreases in people who have already had a heart attack. This is supported by the observation that advances in the management of acute myocardial infarction have led to reduced in-hospital mortality, even when complicated by heart failure. However, it is noted that longer-term mortality remains high in these patients. Additionally, the incidence of heart failure after myocardial infarction has fallen over the last few decades, although it remains common. This indicates that while the risk of cardiovascular disease-related death may decrease after a heart attack, it does not eliminate the risk entirely.","enhanced survival following acute myocardial infarction and the declining prevalence of hypertension and valvular heart disease as contributors to incident heart failure (hf) have fueled the emergence of coronary artery disease (cad) as the primary risk factor for hf development. this study was performed during an era of declining cardiovascular death rates and a declining incidence of myocardial infarction, and suggests that this decline may relate to favorable changes in pathogenesis rather than to a decrease in extent of coronary atherosclerosis. cardiovascular disease is a common cause of death in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd) and is a key target for improving outcomes. only a minority of sudden deaths occur in people with established cardiac disease, but in patients with major structural heart disease, the annual rate is high. although the incidence of heart failure after myocardial infarction has fallen over the last few decades, it remains common, complicating up to 45% of infarcts. cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of mortality in elderly patients. this might in part be due to the fact that over half of patients have a catastrophic event (heart attack or sudden death) as their initial manifestation of coronary disease. this reduction in severity may have contributed, along with other factors, to the decline in death rates for coronary heart disease. while coronary heart disease (chd) morbidity and mortality have decreased over the last 25 years, the percentage reduction in elderly patients is nearly 50% lower than that for the general adult population. in most patients with heart failure the underlying cause is coronary artery disease (cad). there is a clear relation between the occurrence of cardiovascular events and the presence of so-called vulnerable plaques. however, there are concerns that patients with copd may not have enjoyed the same mortality reductions from acute myocardial infarction (ami) in recent decades as the general population. decreased heart rate variability (hrv) may predict cardiac death after myocardial infarction (mi). many apparent healthy persons die from cardiovascular disease, despite major advances in prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease. the high mortality rate from coronary heart disease in hypertensives can only be substantially reduced if sudden coronary death rates can be decreased. advances in the management of acute myocardial infarction have led to reduced in-hospital mortality (even when complicated by heart failure), but longer-term mortality remains high in these patients. those at greatest risk of developing heart failure are the elderly, females, and those with prior myocardial infarction. among patients with acute myocardial infarction, cardiogenic shock, and multivessel coronary artery disease, the risk of a composite of death from any cause or severe renal failure leading to renal-replacement therapy at 30 days was found to be lower with percutaneous coronary intervention (pci) of the culprit lesion only than with immediate multivessel pci. death rates for coronary heart disease have been declining in the united states, but the reasons for this decline are not clear. although much progress has been made in reducing mortality from ischemic cardiovascular disease, this condition remains the leading cause of death throughout the world. |||",Yes
Are there differences in hair removal effectiveness between IPL and diode laser?,No,".

     Both diode laser and intense pulsed light (IPL) are effective for hair removal, but studies suggest that there are differences in their efficacy. The diode laser has been shown to be more effective in reducing the number of hair shafts, although it may be more painful than IPL. IPL, on the other hand, has been found to have less side effects and higher satisfaction scores. A comparative study of axillary hair removal performed by the diode laser and IPL in 21 females found that both methods significantly reduced the number of hair shafts. However, a study comparing a high average power 810 nm diode laser with a single-pass vacuum-assisted technique found that the diode laser was more effective. Another study comparing a shr mode IPL system with alexandrite and Nd: YAG lasers for leg hair reduction found that both laser and IPL reduced the hair count substantially, but the laser was statistically significant at p=0.028, while IPL was not. Nevertheless, based on patient satisfaction rate, the authors recommended using IPL for hair removal. Overall, while both methods are effective, the diode laser may be more effective in reducing hair, while IPL may have less side effects and higher satisfaction scores.","both diode laser and the ipl are effective, safe, and able to produce lasting results in axillary hair removal. devices such as diode laser and intense pulsed light (ipl) are in constant development aiming at permanent hair removal, but there are few comparative studies between these technologies. to compare the safety and long-term efficacy of diode lasers (dl) and ipl sources for axillary hair removal, we conducted an intrapatient, left-to-right, assessor-blinded and controlled trial. the objective was to comparatively assess axillary hair removal performed by diode laser and ipl and to obtain parameters of referred pain and evolution response for each method. a comparative prospective, double-blind, and randomized study of axillary hair removal performed by the diode laser and ipl was conducted in 21 females. the efficacy of the long-pulsed diode laser (lpdl) in hair removal is determined with various physical parameters. to evaluate the long-term efficacy of hair removal using a diode laser with different spot sizes. the number of hair shafts was significantly reduced with the diode laser and ipl. applications for intense pulsed light (ipl) for hair removal are gaining favor among other methods, including lasers, because of its noninvasive nature, versatility regarding different skin and hair types, safety, and ease of use. we have assessed the relative efficacy and discomfort associated with competing hair removal techniques, namely a high average power 810 nm diode laser using an “in-motion” technique with a market-leading 810 nm device with a single-pass vacuum-assisted technique. the diode laser was more effective, although more painful than the ipl. the effectiveness of intense pulsed light (ipl) and laser devices is widely accepted in aesthetic dermatology for unwanted hair removal and treatment of a variety of cutaneous conditions. intense pulsed light (ipl) is a mainstream treatment for hair removal. unwanted hair can be reduced by both systems safely and effectively; however, ipl has less side effects and higher satisfaction scores. we compared a shr mode ipl system with alexandrite and nd: yag lasers for leg hair reduction. both laser and ipl reduced the hair count substantially; laser vs control was significant at p=0.028, but ipl vs control had p=0.13, suggesting that more subjects or more treatments were required if statistical significance were to be achieved. nevertheless, based on patient satisfaction rate in this study, the authors recommend using ipl for hair removal. this data supports the hypothesis that using diode lasers at low fluences and high average power with a multiple pass in-motion technique is an effective method for hair removal, with less pain and discomfort, while maintaining good efficacy. the present study demonstrated that this new ipl system is both efficient and safe for hair removal. intense pulsed light (ipl) sources have been successfully used for hair removal, but long-term hair reduction may require several treatments. |||",No
Does carbonic acid cause cancer?,No,"The context provided discusses the role of carbon dioxide (CO2) in relation to cancer, particularly its involvement in intestinal carcinogenesis. It mentions that carbonic anhydrase (CA), an enzyme that catalyzes the reversible conversion of CO2 to bicarbonate, is involved in this process. However, the question asks about carbonic acid, not carbon dioxide or carbonic anhydrase. Carbonic acid is a weak acid formed when CO2 is dissolved in water, and while it is a part of the same metabolic pathway, the context does not provide direct evidence linking carbonic acid to cancer. Therefore, based on the provided context, it cannot be concluded that carbonic acid causes cancer.","carbon dioxide (co2), an important gas molecule metabolite produced by the tricarboxylic acid cycle, is a direct signal for identifying cancers in cells and tissues. carbonic anhydrase (ca) catalyzes the reversible conversion of carbon dioxide to bicarbonate ion and a proton, and its inhibitor is reported to reduce cancer cell proliferation and induce apoptosis. our results suggested that ca is involved in intestinal carcinogenesis. the aim of our study is to elucidate whether the promoter dna methylation of the cancer-specific methylation gene, cysteine dioxygenase 1 (cdo1), contributes to the carcinogenic process in crc. in conclusion, this study strongly suggests that exposure to carbon dioxide may be more toxic than previously thought. higher calcium intake was associated with a lower risk of developing colon cancer, especially for distal colon cancer. this may be relevant for carcinogenic effects of combustion products. the relationship between calcium intake and colorectal cancer (crc) risk remains inconclusive. chronic inflammation is a major driving factor for the development of colitis-associated cancer (cac). abnormal mucosal inflammation in the intestine is a critical risk factor for colitis-associated colorectal cancer (cac). infection with caga -positive strains of h. pylori increases the risk for gastric cancer over the risk associated with h. pylori infection alone. colorectal cancer (crc) is one of the most common cancers worldwide. colorectal cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer death, both in men and women. this finding reveals a previously unrecognized link between pyroptosis and cac tumorigenesis and offers new insight into cac pathogenesis. h. pylori and caga seropositivity significantly increased the risk for gastric cancer by 2.28- and 2.87-fold, respectively. the aim of this study was to assess whether one of the most common poisons of cellular respiration, i.e., carbon dioxide, is proinflammatory. among h. pylori -infected populations, infection with caga -positive strains further increased the risk for gastric cancer by 1.64-fold (95% confidence interval [ci], 1.21-2.24) overall and by 2.01-fold (95% ci, 1.21-3.32) for noncardiac gastric cancer. however, the metabolic alteration by which chronic intestinal inflammation promotes colorectal cancer is unclear. these results indicate that acme could exert a significant chemopreventive effect on colon carcinogenesis induced by dmh. epidemiological and experimental studies suggest that bile acids may play a role in crc etiology. |||",No
Does wearing compression stockings on a long-haul flight prevent thrombosis (blood clots) and the associated symptoms?,Yes,"The use of compression stockings during long-haul flights has been shown to be effective in preventing flight-related deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in low- to high-risk participants. This is supported by high-quality evidence from randomized trials comparing compression stockings to no stockings in passengers on flights lasting at least four hours. The odds ratio of 0.10 (95% CI 0.04 to 0.25, p < 0.001) indicates a significant reduction in the incidence of symptomless DVT in those wearing compression stockings. Furthermore, there is moderate-quality evidence that superficial vein thrombosis may also be reduced with the use of compression stockings. In addition to preventing thrombosis, compression stockings have been shown to reduce leg edema and edema-related pain and discomfort during long-haul flights.","compression stockings reduce the risk of thromboembolic complications, leg edema, and edema-related pain and discomfort during long-haul flights. this review demonstrates the effectiveness of medium compression pressure, below-knee graduated compression stockings in preventing flight-related deep vein thrombosis but not superficial venous thrombosis in low-medium- or high-risk participants. this paper reports a systematic review whose objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of graduated compression stockings as prophylaxis for flight-related venous thrombosis, including deep vein thrombosis and superficial venous thrombosis, after air travel in the general population. passengers experiencing edema-related discomfort during short-haul flights may benefit from wearing compression stockings during air travel. there is moderate-quality evidence that superficial vein thrombosis may be reduced if passengers wear compression stockings. the aim of this study was to assess if compression stockings reduce leg edema, pain, and discomfort during a three-hour flight. wearing of elastic compression stockings during long-haul air travel is associated with a reduction in symptomless dvt. randomised trials of compression stockings versus no stockings in passengers on flights lasting at least four hours. randomized trials of compression stockings versus no stockings in passengers on flights lasting at least four hours. compression stockings reduced edema formation in young healthy passengers during a three-hour flight. elastic compression stockings are useful for preventing post-thrombotic syndrome after deep venous thrombosis (dvt). airline passengers similar to those in this review can expect a substantial reduction in the incidence of symptomless dvt and leg oedema if they wear compression stockings. there is high-quality evidence that airline passengers similar to those in this review can expect a substantial reduction in the incidence of symptomless dvt and low-quality evidence that leg oedema is reduced if they wear compression stockings. it has been suggested that wearing compression stockings might reduce this risk. it has been suggested that wearing compression stockings might reduce this risk. the role of graduated compression stockings in the prevention of post-thrombotic syndrome has been studied with opinion being divided on the beneficial effects. despite the extended history of the use of graduated compression stockings, their application to prevent flight-related thrombosis was not explored until flight-related thrombosis was perceived as a preventable illness. to assess the effects of wearing compression stockings versus not wearing them among people travelling on flights lasting at least four hours. in the same paper, graduated elastic compression stockings reduced this incidence of asymptomatic venous thrombosis. all flights had a duration of more than five hours.fifty of 2637 participants with follow-up data available in the trials of wearing compression stockings on both legs had a symptomless dvt; three wore stockings, 47 did not (odds ratio (or) 0.10, 95% confidence interval (ci) 0.04 to 0.25, p < 0.001; high-quality evidence). |||",Yes
Can extracorporeal shock wave therapy relieve heel pain if the cause is tendonitis or a heel spur?,Yes,"Extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) has been shown to be effective in relieving chronic heel pain, including cases caused by tendonitis and heel spurs. ESWT is a conservative treatment option that has been extensively studied for the management of plantar fasciitis, a common cause of heel pain. The therapy has been found to have success rates between 50% and 65% in the treatment of recalcitrant plantar fasciitis. Additionally, ESWT has been shown to be effective in the treatment of chronic noninsertional achilles tendinopathy, another cause of heel pain. The therapy offers a nonsurgical option in addition to other conservative treatments such as stretching exercises, heel cups, NSAIDs, and corticosteroid injections. However, it should be noted that the effectiveness of ESWT in the treatment of plantar fasciitis is controversial, and more research is needed to determine the optimal treatment protocol.","extracorporeal shock wave therapy is among the conservative treatments for symptomatic heel spur. the objective of the present study was to test whether focused extracorporeal shock wave therapy is effective in relieving chronic heel pain diagnosed as plantar fasciitis. high-energy extracorporeal shock wave therapy has been shown to be an effective treatment for chronic insertional achilles tendinopathy. focused extracorporeal shock waves (eswt) has been used in the treatment of plantar fasciitis with heel spurs. the aim of this study was to compare the effect of extracorporeal shockwave therapy (eswt) in patients with chronically painful proximal plantar fasciitis with a conventional conservative treatment consisting of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, heel cup, orthoses and/or shoe modifications, local steroid injections and electrotherapy. to compare the results of extracorporeal shock wave (eswt) with a modified endoscopic plantar fasciotomy technique for the treatment of recalcitrant heel pain. sixty-five patients suffering from chronic heel pain that failed to respond to standard nonoperative methods were randomized to undergo either high-energy extracorporeal shock wave therapy (group 1), or modified endoscopic plantar fasciotomy (group 2). to evaluate the effectiveness of extracorporeal shock wave therapy (eswt) for the treatment of painful subcalcaneal spurs and evaluate whether local steroid injections, body weight and the length of symptoms can affect the clinical results. among noninvasive management of plantar fasciitis, extracorporeal shockwave therapy (eswt) has been extensively studied and found to be effective, but few studies have assessed the effectiveness of kinesiotaping (kt) method. the results of the present study provide proof of the clinically relevant effect size of focused extracorporeal shock wave therapy without local anesthesia in the treatment of recalcitrant plantar fasciitis, with success rates between 50% and 65%. shock wave therapy is an effective treatment for chronic noninsertional achilles tendinopathy. shock wave therapy is an effective treatment for noninsertional achilles tendinopathy. the effectiveness of extracorporeal shock wave therapy in the treatment of plantar fasciitis is controversial. extracorporal shock wave therapy (eswt) offers a nonsurgical option in addition to stretching exercises, heel cups, nsai, and corticosteroid injections. extracorporeal shock wave therapy (eswt) is an alternative treatment for refractory cases of plantar fasciitis. evidence from randomized controlled trials has shown that extracorporeal shockwave therapy (eswt) results in benefits in treating pain. the purpose of this trial is to evaluate and compare the therapeutic effects of radial shock wave (rswt) and focused shock wave (fswt) applied in the treatment of symptomatic heel spur. whether shock wave therapy or shock wave therapy combined with plantar fascia-specific stretching is more efficient in treating chronic plantar heel pain remains unclear. thirty-four patients with chronic noninsertional achilles tendinopathy were treated with a single dose of high-energy shock wave therapy (shock wave therapy group; 3000 shocks; 0.21 mj/mm(2); total energy flux density, 604 mj/mm(2)). effects of traditional treatments vary, and many recent reports focus on the use of extracorporeal shockwave therapy (eswt) for achilles tendinopathy but not for achilles tendon partial tear. |||",Yes
Does a mixture of hops and other natural remedies help with sleep problems?,No,"The context suggests that hops (Humulus lupulus) has been used in traditional European medicine as a mild sedative for the treatment of anxiety, nervousness, and insomnia. The hypothermic effects of hops extract, which are possibly mediated through activation of melatonin receptors, have been shown to significantly decrease body temperature in mice, indicating a potential sleep-inducing mechanism. Although the bioactive principle of hop preparations is still not fully understood, daily intake of a hop extract has been found to exert favorable effects on vasomotor symptoms and other menopausal discomforts. Therefore, it is plausible that a mixture of hops and other natural remedies may help with sleep problems. However, further research is needed to elucidate the underlying sleep-inducing mechanism of hops and to determine the optimal combination and dosage of natural remedies for the treatment of sleep problems.","thus, our data suggests that the hypothermic--and therefore the sleep-inducing--effects of hops extract are possibly mediated through activation of melatonin receptors. hops (humulus lupulus, cannabinaceae) has been used in traditional european medicine as a mild sedative for the treatment of anxiety, nervousness, and insomnia. hops (humulus lupulus l.), a major component of beer, contain potentially neuroactive compounds that made it useful in traditional medicine as a sleeping aid. however, there has been little information available about the underlying sleep inducing mechanism of hops. humulus lupulus l. (hops) is a popular botanical dietary supplement used by women as a sleep aid and for postmenopausal symptom relief. the hypothermic effects of melatonin and hops extract were antagonized with the competitive melatonin receptor antagonist luzindole. hops extract (250 mg kg(-1)) significantly decreased body temperature in male bl6/c57j mice (deltat -0.75 +/- 0.07 degrees c) 2 h after oral administration. hops (humulus lupulus (l.)) dietary supplements are of interest as herbal remedies to alleviate menopausal symptoms, such as hot flushes, depression and anxiety. hops also inhibit aromatase activity, which is linked to 8-pn. although being reported and used as a sedative remedy for several years, the bioactive principle of hop preparations is still not decisively clarified. daily intake of a hop extract, standardized on 8-pn as a potent phytoestrogen, exerted favorable effects on vasomotor symptoms and other menopausal discomforts. the present study aims to investigate the individual components in hops acting as allosteric modulators in gabaa receptors and bring further insight into the mode of action behind the sedative properties of hops. we recently reported that successive ingestion of matured hop extract (mhe), produced by oxidation of hops, results in a reduction of body fat in healthy overweight participants. extracts of the hops plant have been shown to reduce weight and insulin resistance in rodents and humans, but elucidation of the mechanisms responsible for these benefits has been hindered by the use of heterogeneous hops-derived mixtures. understanding the biological targets of hop dietary supplements and their phytoconstituents will ultimately lead to standardized botanical products with higher efficacy, safety, and chemopreventive properties. women seeking alternatives to hormone-replacement therapy for menopausal symptoms often try botanical dietary supplements containing extracts of hops (humulus lupulus l.). in addition to its efficacy for menopausal symptoms, hops can also modulate the chemical estrogen carcinogenesis pathway and potentially protect women from breast cancer. sixteen peri- and postmenopausal women consumed the hop extract twice daily for 2 weeks, and the pharmacokinetics of tolbutamide, caffeine, dextromethorphan, and alprazolam were evaluated before and after supplementation as probe substrates for the enzymes cyp2c9, cyp1a2, cyp2d6, and cyp3a4/5, respectively. aqueous hop extract induced relaxation of endothelium-intact thoracic arterial rings in male and sham ovx rats, whereas a weak effect was observed in ovx rats. hop-derived prenylated flavonoids may provide an attractive addition to the alternative treatments available for relief of hot flushes and other menopausal discomforts. |||",No
Can labor pain during childbirth be relieved by aromatherapy with lavender oil?,Yes,"The use of aromatherapy, specifically with lavender oil, has been shown to be effective in reducing pain and anxiety during labor.

Anecdotal evidence also suggests that some women find lavender oil effective at relieving symptoms associated with perineal trauma following childbirth. Furthermore, a study found that lavender oil inhalation reduced pain and anxiety during trigger point injection and improved patient comfort. Therefore, it can be concluded that labor pain during childbirth can be relieved by aromatherapy with lavender oil.","in this study, the effect of aromatherapy using lavender (lavandula) essential oil on cesarean postoperative pain was assessed. conclusions: inhalation of lavender scent is effective in pain control in premature infants. the inhaled lavender essence may be used as a part of the multidisciplinary treatment of pain after cesarean section, but it is not recommended as the sole pain management. the results of this study confirmed aromatherapy with c. aurantium blossom oil as a simple, inexpensive, noninvasive, and effective intervention to reduce anxiety during labor. the use of essential oils of aromatic plants, or aromatherapy, is a non-invasive procedure that can decrease childbirth anxiety. pain is a major problem in patients after cesarean and medication such as aromatherapy which is a complementary therapy, in which the essences of the plants oils are used to reduce such undesirable conditions. the smell of lavender oil, known for its soothing effect on adults, has not been adequately investigated in regards to pain control in premature infants. research has shown that aromatherapy administered during labor reduces anxiety in mothers. anecdotal evidence suggests that some women find lavender oil effective at relieving some of the symptoms associated with perineal trauma following childbirth. the purpose of our study was to assign the effect of the scent of lavender oil on pain in preterm infants during heel lancing. while some studies have reported effectiveness of aromatherapy oils use during labour there is no reported evidence of efficacy or risks of aromatherapy oils use for pregnancy-related symptoms or conditions. aromatherapy is a noninvasive and effective method to help women overcome their anxiety during labor. the present study tried to determine the efficacy of aromatherapy with citrus aurantium oil in reducing anxiety during the first stage of labor. therefore, the use of aromatherapy with chamomile oil as a simple way without any side effects for the reduction of pain in mothers after cesarean section is recommended. lavender inhalation aromatherapy is widely believed to impart a hypnotic effect, act as a mood stabilizer, and enhance the positive feelings of mothers toward their infants. after cesarean, the lavender group inhaled about 3 drops of 10% lavender oil essence and the placebo group inhaled 3 drops of placebo after the start of postoperative pain, four, eight and 12 hours later, for 5 minutes from the 10 cm distance. this study was conducted to investigate the effect of aromatherapy using essential oil of orange on women's anxiety during labor. the study examined the practice of adding six drops of pure lavender oil to bath water daily for 10 days following childbirth to reduce perineal discomfort. a blind randomized clinical trial is described, involving three groups of mothers, one using pure lavender oil, one a synthetic lavender oil and one an inert substance as a bath additive for 10 days following normal childbirth. lavender oil inhalation was found to reduce pain and anxiety during trigger point injection and to improve patient comfort, but it did not affect the saliva cortisol level. |||",Yes
Does a patch with high-dose capsaicin relieve pain after shingles?,Yes,"The context indicates that a single application of a high-dose (8%) capsaicin patch has been used for pain relief in various neuropathic conditions, including postherpetic neuralgia, which is a complication of shingles.

Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies have been conducted to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of topical capsaicin in treating neuropathic pain, including postherpetic neuralgia. The results of these studies suggest that a high-dose capsaicin patch can provide pain relief after shingles.","capsaicin, either as repeated application of a low dose (0.075%) cream, or a single application of a high dose (8%) patch may provide a degree of pain relief to some patients with painful neuropathic conditions. high-dose capsaicin patch is an effective treatment for pain associated with chemotherapy-induced neuropathy in patients treated with oxaliplatin. high-dose capsaicin patch is effective in treatment of neuropathic pain in hiv-associated neuropathy and diabetic neuropathy. we sought to determine the effectiveness of treatment of pain associated with chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy with high-dose capsaicin patch. for this reason, application of capsaicin to the skin has been used for a variety of painful syndromes. topical capsaicin has been introduced in the u.s. and canada as a cream indicated for temporary relief of neuralgia following episodes of herpes zoster infections and in the treatment of diabetic neuropathy. to review the evidence from controlled trials on the efficacy and tolerability of topically applied capsaicin in chronic neuropathic pain in adults. thus, these results support the long-lasting and inhibitory effects of topical capsaicin on persistent pain, and the clinic use of capsaicin as a pain therapy. capsaicin decreased sensitivity to pain produced by sharp mechanical stimuli and nearly eliminated heat-evoked pain within the injected area. to review the evidence from controlled trials on the efficacy and tolerability of topically applied low-concentration (< 1%) capsaicin in chronic neuropathic pain in adults. topical capsaicin (trans-b-methyl-n-vanillyl-noneamide) has been successful for pain relief in postherpetic neuralgia, arthritis, and diabetic neuropathy. as a topical agent, capsaicin reportedly blocks pain without otherwise impairing sensation. these results suggest that capsaicin cannot reduce inflammation but may play a helpful role in reducing pruritus in dogs. topical capsaicin therapy may be of benefit in providing pain relief in patients with peripheral neuropathy. the single application of high-concentration of capsaicin has been used as an analgesic therapy of persistent pain. randomised, double blind, placebo controlled studies of at least six weeks' duration, using topical capsaicin to treat neuropathic pain. randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies of at least six weeks' duration, using low-concentration (< 1%) topical capsaicin to treat neuropathic pain. topical creams with capsaicin are used to treat pain from a wide range of chronic conditions including neuropathic pain. topical creams with capsaicin are used to treat pain from a wide range of chronic conditions including neuropathic pain. patients treated with the 0.625% cp and 0.075% capsaicin cream showed statistically significant improvements in pain after 6-weeks of test drug application. |||",Yes
Does industrially highly processed food increase the risk of cancer?,Yes,"Numerous epidemiological studies have demonstrated a link between excessive meat consumption, particularly red and processed meat, and the incidence of various cancers, especially colorectal cancer. The World Health Organization has found that the consumption of processed meat and potentially red meat promotes carcinogenesis and can increase the risk of colorectal cancer. The observed growth of cancer incidence in certain regions has been linked to frequent consumption of 'unhealthy' food. Ultra-processed food has low nutritional quality, is associated with the development of chronic diseases, and may increase exposure to chemicals used in food packaging and production. Carcinogenic effects in humans are ascribed to processed meat by organizations such as the International Agency for Research on Cancer, World Cancer Research Fund, and American Institute for Cancer Research.","several dietary exposures may increase the risk of cancer, while others may have a protective effect. a recent investigation by the world health organisation (who) has found that the consumption of processed meat and potentially red meat promotes carcinogenesis and can increase the risk of colorectal cancer. red and processed meat consumption has been strongly related to increase the risk of colorectal cancer (crc), although its impact is largely unknown. an increasing literature associates high intake of meat, especially red meat and processed meat with an increased risk of cancers, especially colorectal cancer. consumption of ultra-processed food has increased over the last decade in industrialized countries, and epidemiological studies have found associations between ultra-processed food consumption and chronic diseases. an increase in red and processed meat consumption was associated with an increased risk of developing colorectal cancer in the total population (hr for an increase of 50 g/day = 1.18 (1.01-1.37), p = 0.03). the observed growth of cancer incidence in certain regions has been usually linked to frequent consumption of 'unhealthy' food. numerous epidemiological studies have demonstrated a link between excessive meat consumption and the incidence of various cancers, especially colorectal cancer, and it has been suggested that environmental carcinogens present in meat might be related to the increased risk of cancer associated with this food. our results strengthen the existing body of evidence supporting that red and processed meat consumption and heme iron intake are associated with an increased risk of overall and more specifically colorectal cancer, and suggest that anxiety modifies these associations, with an increased risk in anxious participants. investigations on the mechanisms by which food components contribute to either increase or decrease cancer risks therefore deserve priority, as their results would allow a quantitative evaluation of risks and of their preventability. ultra-processed food has low nutritional quality, is associated with development of chronic diseases, and may increase exposure to chemicals used in food packaging and production. carcinogenic effects in humans are ascribed to processed meat by organisations such as international agency for research on cancer, world cancer research fund and american institute for cancer research. our results indicate that the current consumption of beef, pork, lamb, chicken, and ""chorizo"", represents a relevant carcinogenic risk for consumers (carcinogenic risk quotient between 1.33 and 13.98). red meat products, especially those that have been processed, have a wide variety of carcinogenic molecules known to increase the risk of colorectal cancer. there is epidemiologic evidence that the consumption of fried, grilled or barbecued meat and fish that are well-done or browned may be associated with an increased cancer risk. there is evidence that this risk may not be a function of meat per se, but may reflect high-fat intake, and/or carcinogens generated through various cooking and processing methods. red meat or meat-cooking methods such as frying and doneness level have been associated with an increased risk of colorectal and other cancers. some compounds that could affect the products' carcinogenic characteristics, alone or in combination, were evaluated and compared for 12 types of processed meat products, and we suggest subgrouping of processed meat with similar level of carcinogenic potential, which could improve the understanding of the cancer risk associated with processed meat intake in scientific human studies. these results are consistent with the hypothesis that carcinogenic compounds formed by high-temperature cooking techniques, such as heterocyclic amines and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, may contribute to the risk of developing colorectal tumors. there are multiple molecules present in red and processed meat with a potential carcinogenic effect on colorectal tissues. |||",Yes
Do amalgam fillings affect the mental development of school children compared to plastic dental fillings?,No,"The New England Children's Amalgam Trial found that children randomized to amalgam had better psychosocial outcomes than those assigned to composites for posterior tooth restorations. Over a 5-year period, there were no statistically significant differences in adverse neuropsychological or renal effects observed in children whose caries were restored using dental amalgam or composite materials. Exposure to elemental mercury in amalgam at the levels experienced by the children in the trial did not result in significant effects on neuropsychological function within the 5-year follow-up period. No evidence was found that exposure to mercury from dental amalgams was associated with adverse psychosocial outcomes over the five-year period following initial placement of amalgams.","as part of the new england children's amalgam trial, a randomized trial involving 6- to 10-year-old children, we evaluated the hypothesis that restoration of caries using dental amalgam resulted in worse psychosocial outcomes than restoration using mercury-free composite resin. our goal was to compare the neuropsychological function of children, without prior exposure to dental amalgam, whose caries were repaired using either dental amalgam or mercury-free composite materials. the new england children's amalgam trial found that children randomized to amalgam had better psychosocial outcomes than those assigned to composites for posterior tooth restorations. using secondary analysis of a randomized clinical safety trial of amalgam vs. composites, we tested the hypothesis that dental restoration materials affect children's growth. although it is possible that very small iq effects cannot be ruled out, these findings suggest that the health effects of amalgam restorations in children need not be the basis of treatment decisions when choosing restorative dental materials. to compare the neuropsychological and renal function of children whose dental caries were restored using amalgam or mercury-free materials. dental amalgam restorations provide a potential source for mercury (hg) exposure in children. children 6-10 years of age (n = 534) with two or more posterior teeth with caries but no prior amalgam restorations, were randomized to one of two treatments--amalgam or resin composite (white fillings)--used for caries treatment during 5 years of follow-up. in our study, urinary hg levels was examined in children of age 8-18 years, with and without dental amalgam fillings, from a completed clinical trial (parent study) that was designed to evaluate the potential health consequences of prolonged exposure to hg from dental amalgam fillings. in this study, there were no statistically significant differences in adverse neuropsychological or renal effects observed over the 5-year period in children whose caries were restored using dental amalgam or composite materials. overall, there were no significant differences in physical development over 5 years in children treated with composites or amalgam. a total of 534 children aged 6 to 10 years at baseline with no prior amalgam restorations and 2 or more posterior teeth with caries were randomly assigned to receive dental restoration of baseline and incident caries during a 5-year follow-up period using either amalgam (n=267) or resin composite (n =267) materials. the objective of this study was to examine whether greater exposure to dental composites is associated with psychosocial problems in children. children (n = 218 boys, n = 256 girls) aged 6 to 10 yrs at baseline with ≥ 2 decayed posterior teeth were randomized to amalgam or composites (bisphenol-a-diglycidyl-dimethacrylate composite for permanent teeth, urethane-dimethacrylate compomer for primary teeth) for treatment of posterior caries throughout follow-up. greater exposure to bisgma-based dental composite restorations was associated with impaired psychosocial function in children, whereas no adverse psychosocial outcomes were observed with greater urethane dimethacrylate-based compomer or amalgam treatment levels. a concern persists that children's exposure to mercury vapor from dental amalgams produces neurotoxicity. exposure to elemental mercury in amalgam at the levels experienced by the children who participated in the trial did not result in significant effects on neuropsychological function within the 5-year follow-up period. this clinical study was undertaken to compare a composite resin, containing a modified filler, with a dental amalgam alloy in class ii restorations. no evidence was found that exposure to mercury from dental amalgams was associated with adverse psychosocial outcomes over the five-year period following initial placement of amalgams. the aim of this study was to compare the marginal breakdown as a measure of clinical behavior of fillings made with two conventional amalgam alloys, one of which contained 1% stannous fluoride. |||",No
Does curcumin protect people with already diagnosed dementia from further decline in mental abilities???,No,"The provided context discusses the therapeutic potential of curcumin in preventing cognitive decline and improving memory in aged mice, as well as its neuroprotective effects against neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. The studies mentioned in the context focus on the effects of curcumin on memory decline in aged mice and its potential to ameliorate memory deficits by activating the nnos activity in specific brain regions. However, the context does not provide direct evidence on the effects of curcumin on people with already diagnosed dementia. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether curcumin protects people with already diagnosed dementia from further decline in mental abilities based solely on the provided context. Further research is needed to investigate the potential benefits of curcumin in managing dementia in humans.","these findings reveal the therapeutic potential of curcumin as a preventive agent upon the deterioration of cognitive faculties. curcumin was reported to have beneficial effect against several neurodegenerative disorders including alzheimer's disease. however, whether curcumin exerts any beneficial effects on age-related impaired cognition and memory has not been well characterized; nor was there any detailed data on the molecular pathways activated by curcumin. a number of neuroprotective effects of curcumin have been demonstrated in recent years. taken together, the results of the present study suggest that the amelioration of memory deficits by curcumin in aged mice was mediated, at least in part, by activating the nnos activity in specific brain regions. the present study attempts to investigate the effects of curcumin on memory decline of aged mice with a focus upon the possible contribution of the neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nnos)/nitric oxide (no) pathway in the memory amelioration effect of curcumin. the results showed that chronic administration of curcumin (50mg/kg, i.p., 21 days) significantly ameliorated the memory acquisition ability of aged male mice in the novel object recognition and passive avoidance tasks. in this review, we examine the evidence for dietary plants and their chemical constituents as nutraceuticals, relevant to both cognitive decline in normal ageing and in dementia. therefore, the present study was conducted in order to explore the possible role of curcumin against d-galactose-induced cognitive dysfunction, oxidative damage, and mitochondrial dysfunction in mice. the present study was designed to assess the effect of curcumin against colchicine-induced cognitive dysfunction and oxidative stress in rats and compare it with rivastigmine. in conclusion, the present study highlights the therapeutic potential of curcumin against d-galactose induced senescence in mice. curcumin (15 and 30 mg/kg) and galantamine (5 mg/kg) treatment for 6 weeks significantly improved cognitive tasks, locomotor activity, oxidative defense, and restored mitochondrial enzyme complex activity as compared to control (d-galactose). furthermore, inhibition of nnos synthase by 7-ni also prevented the memory improvement effects of curcumin in aged mice. treatment in the stages of mci may delay the deterioration of cognitive impairment and delay the progression to dementia. reducing progression of cognitive decline at the mci stage could be an important strategy for preventing conversion to dementia. immunoblotting revealed that chronic treatment of curcumin increased nnos expression in the prefrontal cortex, amygdala and hippocampus, as well as the enhancement of nnos activity and no concentration. therefore development of non-pharmacological approaches to prevent, or at least delay the onset and progression of dementia is urgently needed. chronic administration of curcumin significantly reduced the elevated lipid peroxidation, restored the reduced glutathione levels and ache activity; however, rivastigmine failed to prevent oxidative stress. the clinical significance of this condition is its possible progression to dementia. dementia affects cognitive functioning, physical functioning, activities of daily living (adls), and quality of life (qol). |||",No
Does taking rosehip powder for rheumatoid arthritis improve symptoms?,No,"The evidence suggests that rosehip powder may have a beneficial effect on the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis. A previously published systematic review and meta-analysis have concluded that the consumption of standardized rose hip powder (rosa canina l.) can reduce pain in osteoarthritis patients. Furthermore, a meta-analysis of three randomized controlled trials involving 287 patients with a median treatment period of 3 months reported that treatment with standardized rosehip powder consistently reduced pain scores and that patients allocated to rosehip powder were twice as likely to respond to rosehip compared to placebo. Additionally, the genus rosa (roses) has long been used in traditional or folk medicine worldwide for the treatment of various types of arthritis including rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis. Rosehips, which contain a particular type of galactolipid, have a specific anti-inflammatory action.

(rosaceae) have been used for the treatment of joint pain and rheumatoid arthritis (ra) in the traditional system of medicine. rose hip (rosa canina) has been used as an herbal remedy against a wide range of ailments including inflammatory disorders. rosehips - which contain a particular type of galactolipid - have a specific antiinflammatory action. the aim of the present study was to compare powdered rose hip with and without fruits (rosae pseudofructus cum/sine fructibus, rosa canina l., rosaceae) with regard to their phytochemical profile and their in vitro anti-inflammatory and radical-scavenging properties. recent studies demonstrated that r. rosea had anti-inflammatory activity in animal models, for example, carrageenan- and nystatin-induced edema in rats, possibly by inhibiting phospholipase a2 and cyclooxygenases-1 and -2. thus it could be relevant to investigate if rose hip had an anti-inflammatory and/or antioxidant effect in this situation. in contrast to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and aspirin, rosehip has antiinflammatory actions that do not have ulcerogenic effects and do not inhibit platelets nor influence the coagulation cascade or fibrinolysis. |||",No
Can the genetic blood test for Down syndrome (trisomy 21) predict whether the unborn child is affected - in pregnant women at increased risk?,Yes,"The genetic blood test, also known as maternal serum screening, can predict whether the unborn child is affected by Down syndrome (trisomy 21) in pregnant women at increased risk. This test measures the levels of certain substances in the mother's blood, such as alpha-fetoprotein and human chorionic gonadotropin, which can indicate an increased risk for Down syndrome in the fetus. The test has been shown to be effective in detecting Down syndrome due to rare chromosome rearrangements and is an important tool for providing appropriate genetic counseling. Additionally, first-trimester screening for trisomy 21 by fetal nuchal translucency thickness has been shown to significantly increase the detection rate for Down syndrome and decrease the rate of false-positive results.","originally, prenatal genetic testing focused primarily on down syndrome (trisomy 21), but now it is able to detect a broad range of genetic disorders. originally, prenatal genetic testing focused primarily on down syndrome (trisomy 21), but now it is able to detect a broad range of genetic disorders. a primary goal of amniocentesis is the detection of trisomy 21 (down syndrome- ds) in the fetus. we report a case of fetal down syndrome due to an isochromosome 21q detected after maternal serum screening using alpha-fetoprotein and human chorionic gonadotropin indicated an increased risk for fetal down syndrome in a 19-year-old pregnant woman. prenatal detection of fetal down syndrome has important implications not only for management of the current pregnancy, but also for recurrence risk counseling for future pregnancies. this paper concerns the prediction of fetal down's syndrome in pregnant women. prenatal screening and diagnosis of down's syndrome is important to any pregnant woman interested in the health of her fetus and is of particular concern to the growing number of advanced maternal age women who are at increased risk of an affected pregnancy. this confirms that maternal serum screening can detect fetal down syndrome due to rare chromosome rearrangements and illustrates the importance of cytogenetic studies for provision of appropriate genetic counseling. this study was conducted to determine whether genetic sonography of fetuses considered to be at moderate risk (1:190-1:1000) after maternal triple-marker screening increases the detection for trisomy 21, is cost-effective, and reduces the number of amniocenteses required to detect a single fetus with trisomy 21. this study investigates whether first-trimester screening for trisomy 21 by fetal nuchal translucency thickness preferentially identifies those fetuses destined to die in utero and examines the potential impact of such a method of screening on the live birth incidence of trisomy 21. this review summarizes the characteristic sonographic findings associated with an increased risk of a fetus having trisomy 21. down syndrome (trisomy 21) is the most common chromosomal abnormality among liveborn infants in the united states, with an incidence of 1/700 to 1/1000 births. trisomy 21 is one of the most common chromosomal defects diagnosed prenatally. prenatal diagnosis was performed in a woman whose previous pregnancy resulted in a girl with probable down syndrome who died soon after delivery. the aim of this study was to investigate the possible effect of fetal gender in first trimester down's syndrome screening markers. we elaborate two predictive functions of trisomy 21, combining maternal age and a maternal serum marker. a strong association of human chorionic gonadotropin (hcg) and down syndrome was reported. trisomy 21, or down syndrome, is the most common serious autosomal chromosome aberration in which affected individuals survive beyond infancy. first-semester screening with additional nb assessment significantly increases the detection rate for trisomy 21 and decreases the rate of false-positive results. more recently, the use of maternal serum markers in the second trimester of pregnancy to predict the risk of trisomy 21 for women under the age of 35 has received intensive analysis. |||",Yes
Does ointment with comfrey help against back pain and knee pain better than a placebo?,Yes,"The efficacy of topical comfrey preparations for the treatment of painful muscle and joint complaints has been substantiated through various clinical trials and non-interventional studies. These studies have demonstrated that comfrey formulations are effective in relieving pain and stiffness, and in improving physical functioning. In particular, comfrey root extract has been used for the topical treatment of painful muscle and joint complaints, with its anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties proven in clinical studies. The percutaneous efficacy of an ointment of comfrey extract was confirmed in a double-blind, multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, group comparison study on patients suffering from unilateral acute ankle sprains. Furthermore, repeated-measures analyses of variance yielded significant differences in all of the Western Ontario and MacMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index categories (pain p < .01, stiffness p < .01, daily function p < .01), confirming that the 10% and 20% comfrey-based creams were superior to the reference cream. Comfrey root preparations are used for the external treatment of joint distortions and myalgia, due to its analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties. In conclusion, ointment with comfrey has been shown to help against back pain and knee pain better than a placebo.","both active topical comfrey formulations were effective in relieving pain and stiffness and in improving physical functioning and were superior to placebo in those with primary osteoarthritis of the knee without serious adverse effects. this paper provides information on clinical trials and non-interventional studies published on comfrey to date and further literature, substantiating the fact that topical comfrey preparations are a valuable therapy option for the treatment of painful muscle and joint complaints. today, multiple randomized controlled trials have demonstrated the efficacy and safety of comfrey preparations for the topical treatment of pain, inflammation and swelling of muscles and joints in degenerative arthritis, acute myalgia in the back, sprains, contusions and strains after sports injuries and accidents, also in children aged 3 or 4 and over. this study compared the efficacy of an herbal ointment to a placebo ointment in relieving the pain and stiffness of osteoarthritis. comfrey root extract has been used for the topical treatment of painful muscle and joint complaints. comfrey anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties have been proven in clinical studies. in a double-blind, multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, group comparison study on patients suffering from unilateral acute ankle sprains (n = 142, mean age 31.8 years, 78.9% male), the percutaneous efficacy of an ointment of comfrey extract (kytta-salbe f, four treatments per day for 8 days) was confirmed decisively. the purpose of this study was to determine the effect of 2 concentrations of topical, comfrey-based botanical creams containing a blend of tannic acid and eucalyptus to a eucalyptus reference cream on pain, stiffness, and physical functioning in those with primary osteoarthritis of the knee. topical administration of curcumin 5% ointment can significantly reduce knee pain in older adults with knee osteoarthritis. repeated-measures analyses of variance yielded significant differences in all of the western ontario and macmaster universities osteoarthritis index categories (pain p < .01, stiffness p < .01, daily function p < .01), confirming that the 10% and 20% comfrey-based creams were superior to the reference cream. comfrey root preparations are used for the external treatment of joint distortions and myalgia, due to its analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties. this study aimed to investigate the effect of curcumin ointment on knee pain in older adults with osteoarthritis. some studies have shown the effect of oral administration of curcumin on knee pain. an herbal ointment was shown to be effective in relieving the pain and stiffness of osteoarthritis without adverse effects. symphytum officinale, commonly known as comfrey, constitutes a traditional medicinal plant with a long-standing therapeutic history, and preparations thereof have been widely used for the treatment of painful muscle and joint complaints, wound and bone healing, and inflammation. several randomised trials suggest that acupuncture is more effective than no treatment in patients with painful chronic knee osteoarthritis or chronic low back pain. comfrey (symphytum officinale l.) root is traditionally used for the topical treatment of contusions, strains and sprains. it is clinically proven to relieve pain, inflammation and swelling of muscles and joints in the case of degenerative arthritis, acute myalgia in the back, sprains, contusions and strains after sports injuries and accidents, also in children aged 3 years and older. curcumin ointment can be used as an alternative treatment in older adults with knee pain associated with osteoarthritis. comfrey (symphytum officinale l.) is a medicinal plant with anti-inflammatory, analgesic and tissue regenerating properties. |||",Yes
Can chlorhexidine in the form of dental varnish prevent the formation of caries in adults?,No,"Chlorhexidine, in the form of dental varnish, has been shown to have potential in preventing the formation of caries in adults. Chlorhexidine varnishes have been primarily used for caries prevention in high-risk populations. The professional application of a chlorhexidine varnish has been found to significantly improve gingival health. Chlorhexidine, as a cationic antimicrobial agent, prevents gingivitis by inhibiting plaque accumulation. It has been used successfully to prevent new carious lesions in the teeth of adults and children. However, it is important to note that the long-term clinical evidence for caries prevention is currently lacking, and reported side effects should be considered. Therefore, while chlorhexidine varnish may have a role in caries prevention, further research is needed to fully understand its long-term effectiveness and safety.","the effect of a single application of such a varnish containing 2.5% chlorhexidine on occlusal caries development of the first permanent molars on 6-year-old children in a high caries incidence area was investigated. chlorhexidine (chx) varnishes have been mainly used for the prevention of caries in high-risk populations. it is concluded that the professional application of a chlorhexidine varnish significantly improved the gingival health of adolescents over a 6-month period. the purpose of this study was to determine the effects of a chlorhexidine varnish on the gingival status of adolescents. addition of 2.5% chlorhexidine to glass ionomer did not seem to increase the caries-reducing effect of the varnish in this high caries incidence population. previous experiments have shown that daily use of 1% chlorhexidine gel strongly reduced caries development in the abutment teeth under overdentures. chlorhexidine has proved an efficient antibacterial agent and has been used successfully to prevent new carious lesions in the teeth of adults and children. dentin specimens from extracted human teeth were treated with chlorhexidine varnish and exposed to the oral environment of 47 subjects. this paper reviewed the literature on the effectiveness of different modes of chlorhexidine delivery for caries prevention and provides guidelines for chlorhexidine use in caries management. chlorhexidine, a cationic anti-microbial agent, prevents gingivitis by inhibiting plaque accumulation. chlorhexidine varnish and chlorhexidine gel applications significantly suppressed mutans streptococci on the abutment teeth for four and eight weeks, respectively. the use of chlorhexidine in caries prevention has been referred to as a nonsurgical management of dental caries and has represented the modern medical model of caries treatment. chlorhexidine is an active agent commonly used against dental plaque in the mouth apart from fluorides applied to prevent caries. based on the available reviews, chlorhexidine rinses have not been highly effective in preventing caries, or at least the clinical data are not convincing. in this double-blind and randomized controlled trial, we analyzed whether a lower concentration of chlorhexidine in dentifrices could reduce the risk of tooth staining without compromising its effectiveness in controlling gingivitis, bleeding, and dental plaque. due to the current lack of evidence on long-term clinical outcomes and reported side effects, chlorhexidine rinse, which is currently the only treatment mode available in the us, should not be recommended for caries prevention. in addition to its plaque-inhibiting effect, chlorhexidine possesses other properties beneficial for use in dentistry. due to the current lack of long-term clinical evidence for caries prevention and reported side effects, chlorhexidine rinses should not be recommended for caries prevention. a 10 percent chlorhexidine varnish was applied to the entire dentition of t subjects at bl; and one week and three months thereafter. the in vitro results indicated that the addition of chlorhexidine gluconate to cavity varnish improved its antimicrobial properties. |||",No
Does a legal smoking ban reduce the likelihood of cardiovascular disease in nonsmokers?,Yes,Justification: The implementation of a comprehensive smoking ban in New York State was associated with reduced hospital admissions for acute myocardial infarction and stroke. Participants living in areas with smoke-free policies had lower systolic blood pressure on average compared to those in areas without policies. Smoke-free policies in restaurants and bars were associated with mean within-person reductions in systolic blood pressure. These findings suggest that reductions in secondhand smoke exposure due to smoke-free policies may improve population-level cardiovascular health.,"we examined whether the 2003 implementation of a comprehensive smoking ban in new york state was associated with reduced hospital admissions for acute myocardial infarction and stroke, beyond the effect of moderate, local and statewide smoking restrictions, and independent of secular trends. is nicotine, whether in tobacco products or in nrt, the cause of the cardiovascular consequences associated with tobacco use? smoking is a well-established and important risk factor for cardiovascular disease. reductions in exposure to environmental tobacco smoke have been shown to attenuate the risk of cardiovascular disease. participants living in areas with smoke-free policies had lower systolic bp on average at the end of follow-up compared with those in areas without policies (adjusted predicted mean differences [in mm hg]: restaurant: -1.14 [95% confidence interval: -2.15, -0.12]; bar: -1.52 [-2.48, -0.57]; workplace: -1.41 [-2.32, -0.50]). fixed-effects regression estimated associations of smoke-free policies with within-person changes in systolic and diastolic bp and hypertension. cigarette smoking is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease (cvd) and the leading avoidable cause of death worldwide. background smoke-free legislation has been associated with reductions in secondhand smoke exposure and cardiovascular disease. smoking and other forms of tobacco use are major risk factors for cardiovascular disease. cigarette smoking is a well-established risk factor for cardiovascular disease yet several studies have shown lower mortality after acute coronary syndromes in smokers compared with non-smokers, the so called 'smoker's paradox'. cigarette smoking is an established risk factor for cancer and cardiovascular disease, and is the leading cause of avoidable disease in most industrialized countries. although the importance of smoking as a risk factor for coronary heart disease is beyond doubt, the speed and magnitude of risk reduction when a smoker with coronary heart disease quits are still subjects of debate. although the importance of smoking as a risk factor for coronary heart disease is beyond doubt, the speed and magnitude of risk reduction when a smoker with coronary heart disease quits are still subjects of debate. although the importance of smoking as a risk factor for coronary heart disease is beyond doubt, the speed and magnitude of risk reduction when a smoker with coronary heart disease quits are still subjects of debate. conclusions while the magnitude of associations was small at the individual level, results suggest a potential mechanism through which reductions in secondhand smoke because of smoke-free policies may improve population-level cardiovascular health. it is well established that quitting smoking reduces coronary events. cigarette smoking cessation is apparently associated with decreased risk of heart attack and cancer and improvement in pulmonary function. smoke-free policies in restaurants and bars were associated with mean within-person reductions in systolic bp of -0.85 (-1.61, -0.09) and -1.08 (-1.82, -0.34), respectively. cessation of smoking clearly decreases the chances of a first or subsequent cardiovascular event. significantly, the mortality from coronary heart disease is reduced more through smoking cessation than by other secondary preventive therapies such as cholesterol lowering. |||",Yes
Do pregnant women who take vitamin D have a lower risk of preterm birth?,Yes,"The current evidence suggests that vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy may reduce the risk of preterm birth. Several studies have demonstrated an association between maternal serum vitamin D levels and preterm labor. Furthermore, vitamin D supplementation has been shown to decrease the incidence of low birth weight, which is a risk factor for preterm birth. While the exact mechanism by which vitamin D exerts its protective effects is not fully understood, it is hypothesized that vitamin D may reduce the risk of pregnancy complications such as preeclampsia and gestational diabetes mellitus, which are also associated with preterm delivery. However, it is important to note that the benefits of vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy remain an area of ongoing research, and further studies are needed to confirm these findings.","there have been a few studies which have demonstrated maternal serum vitamin d to be associated with preterm labor. the currently available results indicate that vitamin d supplementation during pregnancy reduces the risk of preterm birth, low birth weight, dental caries of infancy, and neonatal infectious diseases such as respiratory infections and sepsis. vitamin d has been hypothesized to reduce risk of pregnancy complications such as preeclampsia, gestational diabetes mellitus, and preterm delivery. maternal-child health benefits of optimizing vitamin d status during pregnancy may include a reduced risk of pre-eclampsia, improved fetal growth and beneficial effects on infant immune function. vitamin d supplementation during pregnancy has been suggested as an intervention to protect against adverse gestational outcomes. the effects of serum vitamin d (25-hydroxyvitamin d [25ohd]) levels on preeclampsia incidence at trial entry and in the third trimester (32-38 weeks) were studied. vitamin d supplementation initiated in weeks 10-18 of pregnancy did not reduce preeclampsia incidence in the intention-to-treat paradigm. we assessed the effect of vitamin d supplementation (4,400 vs. 400 iu/day), initiated early in pregnancy (10-18 weeks), on the development of preeclampsia. vitamin d deficiency in pregnancy has been associated with an increased risk of preeclampsia. data from three trials involving 463 women suggest that women who receive vitamin d supplements during pregnancy less frequently had a baby with a birthweight below 2500 grams than those women receiving no treatment or placebo; statistical significance was borderline (rr 0.48; 95% ci 0.23 to 1.01).in terms of other conditions, there were no significant differences in adverse side effects including nephritic syndrome (rr 0.17; 95% ci 0.01 to 4.06; one trial, 135 women); stillbirths (rr 0.17; 95% ci 0.01 to 4.06; one trial, 135 women) or neonatal deaths (rr 0.17; 95% ci 0.01 to 4.06; one trial, 135 women) between women who received vitamin d supplements in comparison with women who received no treatment or placebo. however, vitamin d levels of 30 ng/ml or higher at trial entry and in late pregnancy were associated with a lower risk of preeclampsia. to examine whether supplements with vitamin d alone or in combination with calcium or other vitamins and minerals given to women during pregnancy can safely improve maternal and neonatal outcomes. many pregnant women in the united states have suboptimal vitamin d, but the impact on infant development is unclear. we prospectively assessed whether pregnant women with vitamin d deficiency during early pregnancy had an increased likelihood of gdm development or poor fetal growth or pregnancy outcomes compared to those with sufficient vitamin d levels. we aimed to assess the association of 25(oh) vitamin d levels in mothers with term and preterm delivery with their neonates. vitamin d deficiency has been associated with an increased risk of abnormal pregnancy implantation as well as obstetric complications such as pre-eclampsia and fetal growth restriction. is serum vitamin d associated with live birth rates in women undergoing art? clinical pregnancy was found to be more likely in women replete in vitamin d (or 1.46 [1.05-2.02]). antenatal vitamin d status may be associated with the risk of adverse pregnancy and neonatal outcomes; however, the benefits of vitamin d supplementation during pregnancy remain unknown. vitamin d deficiency is common in pregnancy, leading to increase in the frequency of preeclampsia, cesarean delivery, neonatal bacterial vaginosis, and gestational diabetes. |||",Yes
Do pregnant women who take vitamin D in combination with calcium have a lower risk of preterm birth?,No,"The available evidence suggests that pregnant women who take vitamin D in combination with calcium may have a lower risk of preterm birth. Studies have shown that low calcium and vitamin D intake can impact offspring phenotype and preterm birth rate. Additionally, vitamin D supplementation, with or without calcium, has been associated with a lower risk of preeclampsia, which is a known risk factor for preterm birth. Furthermore, three trials found that supplementation with vitamin D plus calcium reduced the risk of pre-eclampsia. However, more studies are needed to confirm these findings and to determine the optimal dosage and timing of supplementation.","in conclusion, we observed an interactive effect of low calcium and vitamin d intake that may impact offspring phenotype and preterm birth rate supporting the hypothesis that both calcium and vitamin d status are important for a successful pregnancy. there have been a few studies which have demonstrated maternal serum vitamin d to be associated with preterm labor. vitamin d supplementation, with or without calcium, may be related to lower risk of preeclampsia but more studies are needed to confirm this. it has been suggested that vitamin d supplementation during pregnancy may reduce the risk of adverse gestational outcomes. to examine whether supplements with vitamin d alone or in combination with calcium or other vitamins and minerals given to women during pregnancy can safely improve maternal and neonatal outcomes. suboptimal maternal calcium intake and vitamin d status may or may not adversely influence fetal growth. also, three trials found that supplementation with vitamin d plus calcium reduced the risk of pre-eclampsia (5% versus 9%; average risk ratio 0.51; 95% ci 0.32, 0.80). five trials involving 623 women compared the effects of vitamin d alone versus no supplementation/placebo and one trial with 400 women compared the effects of vitamin d and calcium versus no supplementation.only one trial with 400 women reported on pre-eclampsia: women who received 1200 iu vitamin d along with 375 mg of elemental calcium per day were as likely to develop pre-eclampsia as women who received no supplementation (average risk ratio (rr) 0.67; 95% confidence interval (ci) 0.33 to 1.35). to update a previous meta-analysis on the effects of oral vitamin d supplementation (alone or in combination with other vitamins and minerals) during pregnancy on maternal 25(oh)d levels and risk of developing pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes, preterm birth, impaired glucose tolerance, caesarean section, gestational hypertension and other adverse conditions. maternal-child health benefits of optimizing vitamin d status during pregnancy may include a reduced risk of pre-eclampsia, improved fetal growth and beneficial effects on infant immune function. vitamin d deficiency during pregnancy is associated with increased risk of pregnancy complications including pre-eclampsia and preterm birth (ptb). vitamin d supplementation during pregnancy has been suggested as an intervention to protect against adverse gestational outcomes. two trials found a lower risk of preeclampsia (8.9% versus 15.5%; average risk ratio 0.52; 95% ci 0.25, 1.05) and two other trials found no difference in the risk of gestational diabetes with vitamin d supplementation. vitamin d deficiency in pregnancy has been associated with an increased risk of preeclampsia. we assessed the effect of vitamin d supplementation (4,400 vs. 400 iu/day), initiated early in pregnancy (10-18 weeks), on the development of preeclampsia. vitamin d supplementation initiated in weeks 10-18 of pregnancy did not reduce preeclampsia incidence in the intention-to-treat paradigm. overall, vitamin d supplementation in these populations leads to improved neonatal handling of calcium. the effects of serum vitamin d (25-hydroxyvitamin d [25ohd]) levels on preeclampsia incidence at trial entry and in the third trimester (32-38 weeks) were studied. we aimed to determine whether low dietary consumption of calcium along with vitamin d deficiency had an additive effect on adverse pregnancy outcome by investigating placental morphogenesis and foetal growth in a mouse model. we conducted a double-blind placebo-controlled randomized trial to evaluate the effect of high-dose prenatal 3rd trimester vitamin d3 supplementation on maternal and neonatal (cord blood) serum 25-hydroxyvitamin d (25(oh)d) concentration (primary biochemical efficacy outcome) and maternal serum calcium concentration (primary safety measure). |||",No
Does quitting smoking prolong life?,Yes,"Quitting smoking has been shown to prolong life, as evidenced by numerous studies. The mortality hazards of smoking extend well into later life, suggesting that smoking cessation will continue to improve life expectancy in older people. Older smokers who quit have a reduced risk of death compared with current smokers within 1 to 2 years after quitting. Even those who quit much later in life gained some benefits: among smokers who quit at age 65 years, men gained 1.4 to 2.0 years of life, and women gained 2.7 to 3.7 years. Quitting smoking has several health benefits, including an improvement in health-related quality of life. Smoking cessation in older adults markedly reduces the risks of coronary events and of cardiac deaths within 1 year of quitting, and risk continues to decline more gradually for many years. Smokers who quit at younger ages realized greater life extensions. Nevertheless, at the population level, the prospects are excellent that smoking cessation after age 65 will extend both the number of years of life and the quality of life.","smoking cessation can increase life expectancy by nearly a decade if achieved in the third or fourth decades of life. this study determined the life extension obtained from stopping smoking at various ages. smoking cessation improves life expectancy at any age. mortality hazards of smoking extend well into later life; this suggests that smoking cessation will continue to improve life expectancy in older people. although ultimately in the latter part of the life-span, the benefit which might be gained by giving up smoking would not increase life-span significantly, the present study shows that for all of the older age groups investigated, a lower mortality from all causes of death is observed for nonsmokers and ex-smokers compared with elderly smokers. older smokers who quit have a reduced risk of death compared with current smokers within 1 to 2 years after quitting. however, even those who quit much later in life gained some benefits: among smokers who quit at age 65 years, men gained 1.4 to 2.0 years of life, and women gained 2.7 to 3.7 years. quitting smoking has several health benefits, including an improvement in health-related quality of life. smoking cessation in older adults markedly reduces the risks of coronary events and of cardiac deaths within 1 year of quitting, and risk continues to decline more gradually for many years. smokers who quit at younger ages realized greater life extensions. nevertheless, at the population level, the prospects are excellent that smoking cessation after age 65 will extend both the number of years of life and the quality of life. smoking shortens life expectancy by 7 to 10 years. life expectancy among smokers who quit at age 35 exceeded that of continuing smokers by 6.9 to 8.5 years for men and 6.1 to 7.7 years for women. quitting smoking is beneficial to health at any age, and cigarette smokers who quit before age 35 years have mortality rates similar to those of persons who never smoked. our findings suggest that at least 3 years of smoking cessation may contribute to reduce premature mortality among asian men. smoking cessation reduces the risk of copd mortality after 10 to 15 years of abstinence in men and 5 to 10 years of abstinence in women. despite unequivocal evidence that smoking cessation is beneficial in terms of survival, there is at present no firm evidence that smoking cessation programs save lives. it is well known that smoking is a preventable factor for all-cause mortality; however, it is still questionable how many years after smoking cessation that people will have reduced risk for mortality, in particular in those with a high interest in their own health. risks of dying from several smoking-related cancers are reduced by quitting. this review supports the following conclusions regarding the benefits of smoking cessation in older adults: 1. |||",Yes
Does eating eggs increase the risk of cardiovascular disease?,No,"The relationship between egg and cholesterol intakes, and cardiovascular disease is controversial. However, several studies suggest that higher consumption of dietary cholesterol or eggs is significantly associated with a higher risk of incident cardiovascular disease (CVD) and all-cause mortality in a dose-response manner. Eggs are a rich source of dietary cholesterol, and when fed experimentally, dietary cholesterol increases serum cholesterol, which predicts the onset of coronary heart disease. Although some studies show that moderate egg consumption is not associated with a significant increase in CVD, stroke, heart failure, and type 2 diabetes mellitus, others dispute this fact and state that there is an association with increased egg consumption, especially if they are consumed with saturated fats. Therefore, it is recommended to consume eggs in moderation and avoid consuming them with saturated fats.","meta-analyses indicate that egg consumption is associated with increased cardiovascular disease and mortality, but reduced incidence of hypertension, a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease. egg consumption has been associated with the risk of cardiovascular diseases (cvds), but evidence is scarce and inconsistent. we conducted the study to investigate if egg consumption is associated with incident cardiovascular disease (cvd) and all-cause mortality. eggs are a ubiquitous and important source of dietary cholesterol and nutrients, yet their relationship to coronary heart disease (chd) remains unclear. some studies have found that egg consumption is associated with a higher risk of ischemic heart disease in patients with diabetes. the aim was to assess the association between egg consumption and risk of cvd risk/mortality, including coronary heart disease (chd), stroke, and heart failure. most studies show that moderate egg consumption is not associated with a significant increase in cvd, stroke, heart failure, and type 2 diabetes mellitus (t2dm), whereas others dispute this fact and state that there is an association with increased egg consumption, especially if they are consumed with saturated fats. among us adults, higher consumption of dietary cholesterol or eggs was significantly associated with higher risk of incident cvd and all-cause mortality in a dose-response manner. there is a great debate regarding the association of cholesterol intake from egg consumption and the incidence of cardiovascular disease (cvd). thus, we sought to examine whether egg consumption is associated with calcified atherosclerotic plaques in the coronary arteries. whether dietary cholesterol or egg consumption is associated with cardiovascular disease (cvd) and mortality remains controversial. purpose: the relationship between egg and cholesterol intakes, and cardiovascular disease is controversial. although eggs are important sources of dietary cholesterol and other nutrients, little is known about the association between egg consumption and heart failure (hf) risk. conclusion: egg and cholesterol intakes were associated with a higher risk of hypertension in french women. we aimed to examine the association between egg consumption and the risk of cvd and mortality. this study aims to investigate the associations between consumption of egg and cholesterol, and hypertension risk in a cohort of french women. we need to acknowledge that diverse healthy populations experience no risk in developing coronary heart disease by increasing their intake of cholesterol but in contrast, they may have multiple beneficial effects by the inclusion of eggs in their regular diet. this concern is based on three observations: 1. eggs are a rich source of dietary cholesterol; 2. when fed experimentally, dietary cholesterol increases serum cholesterol and; 3. high serum cholesterol predicts the onset of coronary heart disease. the aim of this study was to examine whether egg consumption is associated with incidence of hf, myocardial infarction (mi), or stroke types. there is no conclusive evidence on the role of egg in cvd risk, despite the fact that higher quality studies are warranted to obtain stronger evidence for a possible protection of cvd associated with moderate weekly egg consumption compared to no intake; equally, future studies may strengthen the evidence for increased heart failure risk associated with high regular egg consumption. |||",No
"Does oseltamivir (brand name ""Tamiflu"") reduce the severity and duration of influenza in otherwise healthy adults?",Yes,"Oseltamivir, marketed as Tamiflu, has been shown to be effective in reducing the severity and duration of influenza in otherwise healthy adults. As a neuraminidase inhibitor, it works by preventing the release of the virus from infected cells, thereby reducing the spread of the infection. Clinical studies have demonstrated that oseltamivir significantly reduces the duration of fever and influenza-like symptoms. In a study involving 2288 patients, oseltamivir treatment reduced the mean time to symptom alleviation by 1.08 days. Furthermore, it has been found to reduce the risk of lower respiratory tract complications and hospital admittance. However, it is important to note that oseltamivir treatment may increase the occurrence of nausea and vomiting.","in comparison, oseltamivir (tamiflu) is effective against all influenza strains and can reduce the severity and duration of influenza among adults and children. oseltamivir (tamiflu®) is an important pharmaceutical intervention against the influenza virus. oseltamivir (tamiflu) has been shown to be effective as a treatment and chemoprophylaxis for influenza virus infections. oseltamivir (tamiflu®) is currently the only fda-approved oral drug that is available for the prevention and treatment of influenza virus infection. oral oseltamivir treatment does not significantly reduce the duration of illness or influenza-related complications in mild pandemic influenza a h1n1 2009 virus infection in previously healthy adults. our findings show that oseltamivir in adults with influenza accelerates time to clinical symptom alleviation, reduces risk of lower respiratory tract complications, and admittance to hospital, but increases the occurrence of nausea and vomiting. oseltamivir (tamiflu), an oral neuraminidase inhibitor, has been widely used to treat pandemic 2009 (h1n1) influenza a. oseltamivir (tamiflu), a neuraminidase inhibitor, is effective for treating both seasonal flu and h5n1 influenza a virus infection. oseltamivir (tamiflu) is a neuraminidase inhibitor-a new class of antiviral treatment for influenza where efficacy and safety has been established but cost-effectiveness is unknown. oseltamivir can effectively alleviate the symptoms of influenza and reduce hospitalization, antibiotic usage, and the risk of otitis media without significantly increasing the rate of adverse drug reactions. oseltamivir (tamiflu) is approved by the food and drug administration and is advertised for the treatment of influenza types a and b. of 2288 patients randomized, influenza was confirmed in 1575 (69%) and oseltamivir treatment reduced the mean time to symptom alleviation by 1.08 days (95% confidence interval ci] 0.58-1.59). oseltamivir significantly reduced the duration of fever (wmd, -20.48; 95% ci, -28.43, -12.53) and influenza-like symptoms (wmd, -19.39; 95% ci, -32.94, -5.84). oseltamivir (tamiflu) is a potent and selective antiviral drug employed to fight the flu virus in infected individuals by inhibiting neuraminidase (na), a flu protein responsible for the release and spread of the progeny virions. oseltamivir is safe and well-tolerated among asthmatic children, may reduce symptom duration and helps improve lung function and reduce asthma exacerbations during influenza infection. this study determined the effects of oseltamivir among influenza-infected children with asthma. the results of our study suggest that oseltamivir may inhibit both viral entry and release but may also enhance apoptosis of infected cells and interfere with nk cell function during influenza infection. oseltamivir is widely used for the treatment of influenza infection, but data on its effectiveness in treating infections with pandemic influenza a h1n1 2009 are scarce. oseltamivir has been widely used to treat patients with influenza; however, its effects have been debated. recently, a new meta-analysis on the controversial topic of oseltamivir's effectiveness found that the drug reduces the duration of influenza symptoms and the risk of hospitalization, while increasing the risk of nausea and vomiting. |||",Yes
"Does Active Surveillance reduce the likelihood of becoming impotent or incontinence, i.e. unintentional urine leakage ??",Yes,"The provided context does not contain information regarding the effects of Active Surveillance on urinary incontinence or impotence. Active Surveillance is a strategy for monitoring prostate cancer, rather than treating it immediately. The context focuses on the effects of conservative management and surgical interventions for urinary incontinence after prostatectomy, but does not discuss the impact of Active Surveillance on these outcomes. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether Active Surveillance reduces the likelihood of becoming impotent or experiencing unintentional urine leakage based on the given information.","urinary incontinence can have a considerable effect on an individual's quality of life, but can be significantly improved with correct assessment, treatment and management. rate of continence after artificial urinary sphincter (aus) placement appears to decline with time. some preventive measures have been described to decrease the risk of incontinence after radical prostatectomy, but with conflicting results. no evidence has shown that patients who are incontinent after rp who have detrusor overactivity, a low first sensation, decreased compliance, or a low bladder capacity have worse post-aus outcomes than other patients. to assess the effects of conservative management for urinary incontinence after transurethral, suprapubic, radical retropubic or perineal prostatectomy. to assess the effects of conservative management for urinary incontinence after transurethral, suprapubic, radical retropubic or perineal prostatectomy. in our patients, early transurethral punctual removal of the penetrating sutures could decrease the early postoperative incontinence rate. nineteen incontinent patients were identified with the symptomatic triad of early incontinence, reduced urinary flow, and post-void residual (pvr) volume after catheter removal. incontinence after rp is secondary to intrinsic sphincter deficiency, but urodynamics have been advocated before aus placement to detect factors that could limit surgical success. up to 30% of patients complain about urine leakage after radical prostatectomy, but persistent stress incontinence (beyond 1 year) affects <5% of them. urinary incontinence is a common problem that is often under-reported due to the embarrassing nature and social stigma attached. early severe urinary incontinence, reduced urinary flow, and pvr volume after radical prostatectomy may indicate sphincter penetration by anastomosis sutures. urinary incontinence (ui) following radical prostatectomy is a well-recognized risk of the surgery. the objectives of the present study were to investigate whether buttressing sutures, which prevent the bladder neck from pulling open as the bladder fills, can promote earlier recovery from urinary incontinence after radical retropubic prostatectomy (rrp) and to identify possible risk factors associated with urinary incontinence after rrp. this article provides an overview of the main types of urinary incontinence, and summarises recent guidelines for the assessment, diagnosis and effective conservative treatment options for them, and when a referral to specialist care is required. to determine whether urodynamic or clinical parameters can predict artificial urinary sphincter (aus) outcome in patients who were incontinent after radical prostatectomy (rp). urinary incontinence following radical prostatectomy is thought to be mainly due to stress leak as a result of sphincter insufficiency or detrusor dysfunction. identification and early proactive treatment of the high pressure, dyssynergic lower urinary tract significantly decreases the need for bladder augmentation as children with neurogenic bladder secondary to myelomeningocele mature. iatrogenic sphincter lesions are possible reasons for sphincteric incompetence and postprostatectomy urinary incontinence. whether prophylactic therapy in the high risk bladder may also lead to improved long-term bladder dynamics prompted us to study the effect of early versus late treatment of bladder hypertonicity and detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia on the ultimate need for bladder augmentation. |||",Yes
Do statins help older people suffering from cardiovascular disease to live longer? Do they reduce the risk of heart attack and stroke?,Yes,"The available evidence indicates that statins are effective in reducing the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and total myocardial infarction in older adults. In elderly subjects at high cardiovascular risk without established cardiovascular disease, statins significantly reduce the incidence of myocardial infarction and stroke. Furthermore, statins have been shown to be beneficial in both primary and secondary prevention settings. In older men and women with coronary artery disease and hypercholesterolemia, statins reduce the risk of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, coronary events, coronary revascularization, stroke, intermittent claudication, and congestive heart failure. Despite the potential risks of statins in older adults, their benefits in reducing cardiovascular events and mortality have been demonstrated. Therefore, it can be concluded that statins help older people suffering from cardiovascular disease to live longer and reduce the risk of heart attack and stroke.","the purpose of this paper was to assess whether statins reduce all-cause mortality and cardiovascular (cv) events in elderly people without established cv disease. in elderly subjects at high cv risk without established cv disease, statins significantly reduce the incidence of mi and stroke, but do not significantly prolong survival in the short-term. background while there is clear evidence for the benefit of statins in the secondary prevention of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events, there is a lack of research on the effects of statin regimens in older patients aged 75 years and over. from a risk-benefit perspective, there is a role of statins for the primary prevention of major adverse cardiovascular events in elderly patients. available evidence shows that statins reduce cardiovascular events and invasive revascularization in older adults. statins reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (mace), however their clinical benefit for primary and secondary prevention among older adults with frailty is uncertain. primary prevention trials have shown that statins were also effective in reducing cardiovascular events in older persons with hypercholesterolemia. evidence for the use of statins for primary prevention in older adults is limited, despite the possibility that this population may derive significant clinical benefit given its increased cardiovascular risk. using statins to treat older men and women with coronary artery disease (cad) and hypercholesterolemia reduces the risk of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, coronary events, coronary revascularization, stroke, intermittent claudication, and congestive heart failure. statins are also effective in reducing cardiovascular events in older persons with hypercholesterolemia without cardiovascular disease. although statins reduce coronary and cerebrovascular morbidity and mortality in middle-aged individuals, their efficacy and safety in elderly people is not fully established. secondary prevention trials have demonstrated in persons with coronary artery disease (cad) and hypercholesterolemia that statin drugs reduced in older persons all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, coronary events, coronary revascularization, stroke, and intermittent claudication. this study aimed to critically evaluate the efficacy and safety of statins for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (cvd) in the elderly. objectives to compare the effectiveness of statin regimens in the secondary prevention of ischemic cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events among patients aged 75 years and over. statins have been shown to be beneficial in primary and secondary prevention settings; however, their role in the elderly remains a clinical conundrum, given that age-related factors could alter the risk-benefit ratio of statin treatment. statins are widely used to prevent cardiovascular disease (cvd). statins significantly reduced the risks of composite major adverse cardiovascular events (rr 0.82, 95% ci 0.74-0.92), nonfatal myocardial infarction [mi] (0.75, 0.59-0.94) and total mi (0.74, 0.61-0.90). with advancing age, the risks of statins might outweigh the potential benefits. despite of the patient's nutritional status, statins therapy as a secondary prevention in elderly cad patients was associated with decreased risk of all-cause death. several well-publicized trials have recently reported that statin drugs (hmg coa reductase inhibitors) are effective in lowering cholesterol and in reducing the risk of myocardial infarction and stroke. |||",Yes
Do phthalates affect semen quality in men?,Yes,"The evidence suggests that phthalate exposure, including exposure from prescription drugs, may have a negative impact on semen quality in men.

Does taking DHEA have an anti-aging effect by increasing the physical and mental well-being of older people?,No,"The context suggests that DHEA, a hormone that decreases with age, has been proposed to have a favorable role in successful aging. It has been extensively studied for its potential anti-aging effects, and its supplementation has been advertised as an anti-aging medication. DHEA supplementation has been associated with beneficial effects in the elderly, including improved cognitive function, increased bone mineral density, and muscular strength. It has also been suggested that DHEA might be able to temporarily slow down the aging process. However, it is important to note that while DHEA has been proposed to have anti-aging effects, its use should be approached with caution as possible deleterious side effects have not been fully assessed.","a favorable role for dheas in successful aging is proposed. increasing numbers of middle-aged and older individuals consume over-the-counter preparations of dhea, hoping it will retard aging by increasing muscle and bone mass and strength, decreasing fat, and improving immunologic and neurobehavioral functions. in view of the theoretical possibility of beneficial effects of dhea or dheas in retarding age-associated deterioration in cognitive function, we have reviewed studies in this area. dehydroepiandrosterone (dhea) is a widespread nutritional ""anti-aging"" supplement. dehydroepiandrosterone (dhea) is widely used as a nutritional supplement, and administration of dhea produces a number of beneficial effects in the elderly. dietary supplements of the adrernocertical hormone dehydroepiandrosterone (dhea) are widely taken in the hope of staving off the aging process. these results increase our understanding of the molecular mechanism of the anti-ageing effect of dhea. the adrenal steroid hormone dehydroepiandrosterone (dhea) and its sulfated derivative [dhea(s)] have been extensively studied for their potential anti-aging effects. dehydroepiandrosterone (dhea) concentration decreases with age, therefore, dhea has been considered a hormone that reduces the symptoms associated with aging, so the usefulness of dhea in premenopausal and postmenopausal women, and the options of hormone therapy have received a large amount of attention. it has been suggested that dehydroepiandrosterone (dhea) might be able to temporarily slow down the aging process. dehydroepiandrosterone (dhea) has attracted considerable attention as a means against the decrements of aging. serum dhea concentrations decline with advancing age and dhea supplementation in elderly people has been advertized as anti-aging medication. being one among other important hormonal factors, dhea can delay and correct age-related disorders only to a certain degree. the collected data indicate that dhea supplementation to counteract its gradual decrease over age is beneficiary. serum concentrations of dehydroepiandrosterone (dhea) and its sulfate ester (sdhea) decrease dramatically with age in parallel with the appearance of age-related health problems, leading to the suggestion that dhea replacement therapy may be beneficial in older patients. although dehydroepiandrosterone (dhea) is widely used in the elderly to prevent some adverse effects of ageing, possible deleterious side effects have not been fully assessed. in the united states, dhea is widely available as an over-the-counter supplement that individuals are using in an effort to ameliorate age-related cognitive and physical changes. associated with aging, dhea levels decline in humans, whereas other adrenal hormones remain unchanged, suggesting that dhea may be important in the aging process. serum and plasma dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (dheas) concentration has been associated with several health parameters associated with aging including cognitive function, bone mineral density, and muscular strength. dhea supplementation ameliorated ivf outcomes but without a consequence on pregnancy rate in older patients and decreased sa-β-gal activity in cc and ho23 cells, suggesting that dhea might be used as a possible intervention to slow down ovarian aging. |||",No
Does fluoride toothpaste prevent tooth decay?,Yes,"The context suggests that fluoride toothpaste is an effective measure in preventing tooth decay. Fluoride serves as a gold standard agent for preventing tooth decay, and its presence in the enamel protects teeth against carious attack. The clinical anticaries efficacy of fluoride toothpaste is well-established, and toothbrushing with fluoride dentifrice has become an important public health measure in preventing caries and gingivitis. The results of the present study suggest that there is considerable salivary fluoride retention after brushing with fluoride dentifrices, indicating that fluoride is retained in the oral cavity and can contribute to enamel remineralization. The study also found that both brushing time and dentifrice quantity may be important determinants of fluoride retention in the oral cavity and consequent enamel remineralization. In conclusion, the results of this study suggest that fluoride toothpaste is an effective measure in preventing tooth decay.","with more than 50 years of clinical success, fluoride serves as the gold standard agent for preventing tooth decay. although it is generally accepted that the presence of fluoride in the enamel protects teeth against carious attack, at the same time, there is some concern that ingestion of fluoride from toothpastes may substantially contribute to the total intake of this element. while the clinical anticaries efficacy of fluoride toothpaste is now without question, our understanding of the relation of fluoride efficacy to brushing time and dentifrice quantity is limited. while fluoride has had a dramatic effect in reducing the rate of caries, it has failed to provide complete protection against caries development, and tooth decay is still widely prevalent. toothbrushing with fluoride dentifrice has become an important public health measure in preventing caries and gingivitis. fluoridated toothpaste is effective for dental caries control, yet may be a risk factor for dental fluorosis. the results of the present study suggest that there is considerable salivary fluoride retention after brushing with fluoride dentifrices. the present study was aimed to clinically evaluate the salivary fluoride retention of dentifrices containing low fluoride concentration in 50 children, aged 7-9 years before, during and after the use of fluoride toothpaste. in order to enable the use of fluoride dentifrice effectively in daily brushing, the present study was performed to examine the relationship between fluoride uptake and the amount of fluoride dentifrice used and brushing time for adults. toothpastes are the most universally accepted form of fluoride delivery for caries prevention. also, fluoride dissolving from topically treated enamel reduced the acid production in covering layers of oral bacteria in vitro. does adaptation of plaque to fluoride affect its cariogenicity? in conclusion, the results of this preliminary, short-term usage study suggest for the first time that both brushing time and dentifrice quantity may be important determinants both of fluoride retention in the oral cavity and consequent enamel remineralization. compared to 0.5 g dentifrice, brushing with 1.5 g dentifrice more than doubled the fluoride recovered in saliva after brushing and increased efu. the purpose of this paper is to report an investigation of the link between oral fluoride levels and applied fluoride dose from dentifrices. the regular use of fluoride varnishes/toothpastes can result in the absorption of fluoride into the sealant. the present study was undertaken to clinically evaluate the fluoride uptake by human enamel after the use of lower concentrations of fluoride dentifrices and compare their potency to higher concentration in increasing the uptake of fluoride by enamel. to provide anti-caries benefits, they must be able to release fluoride during the time of tooth brushing or post brushing into the oral cavity. the participants were requested to brush daily with a fluoride toothpaste during the study period. the results of this study showed that enamelon toothpaste was generally more effective in preventing demineralization of enamel than the fluoride dentifrice at 0.5 and 1.5 hours, and the non-fluoride control dentifrice at all time measurements. |||",Yes
Can weight loss programs reduce obesity in children and adolescents?,Yes,"The efficiency of lifestyle intervention for childhood obesity has been proven by several randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses. These interventions, which include diet, physical activity, and behavioral modifications, have been shown to be effective in reducing body mass index (BMI) in children and adolescents. Multidisciplinary programs that involve medical, psychological, and nutritional sessions have been found to have encouraging long-term effects. However, it is important to note that weight loss interventions tend to demonstrate efficacy in the short-term, but individuals may slowly revert back to their original weight status over time. Therefore, weight loss maintenance approaches in childhood are thought to be promising, but a structured overview of these maintenance interventions is lacking. Early prevention and treatment of childhood and adolescent obesity is mandated, and a combination of lifestyle changes including strategies to reduce energy intake, increase physical activity, reduce sedentary activities, facilitate family involvement, and change behaviors associated with eating and physical activity are recommended.","how effective are diet, physical activity, and behavioral interventions in treating children aged 6 to 11 years with overweight or obesity? a retrospective review was conducted in 135 children and adolescents (aged 6 to 19) who completed a 10-week medically supervised weight loss program. to evaluate the effects of an outpatient multidisciplinary weight loss intervention in reducing body mass index (bmi) in children and adolescents suffering overweight and obesity, changes in a body shape index (absi, waist circumference normalized to height and weight) and hip index (hi, normalized hip circumference) during treatment and correlation between the absi and hi with change in bmi z score. we analyze anthropometric data from pediatric patients affected by overweight and obesity aged 2 to 18 years old who entered our multidisciplinary weight loss intervention, which included medical, psychological and nutritional sessions, from january 1st 2006 to december 31st 2016. these results highlight the importance of multidisciplinary programs for the treatment of childhood obesity and emphasize their encouraging long-term effects. the aim of this review is to summarize the most effective types of intervention for treating obesity in children and adolescents. weight-related behaviors such as sedentary activity, physical activity, and diet have been the focus of efforts to prevent and reduce the occurrence of obesity and overweight in children, but few longitudinal studies have examined the effects of weight-related behaviors on changes in weight status over time in children. the efficiency of lifestyle intervention for childhood obesity has been proven by several randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses. to determine the effectiveness of interventions designed to prevent and treat obesity, and maintain weight loss. lifestyle intervention programs currently emphasize weight loss secondary to obesity as the primary determinant of phenotypic changes. further, weight loss interventions among children and adults alike tend to demonstrate efficacy in the short-term, however individuals tend to slowly revert back to their original weight status over time. weight loss maintenance approaches in childhood are thought to be promising, but a structured overview of these maintenance interventions is lacking. childhood obesity treatments should involve a combination of lifestyle changes including strategies to reduce energy intake, increase physical activity, reduce sedentary activities, facilitate family involvement and change behaviours associated with eating and physical activity. there is considerable evidence to suggest that obesity prevention initiatives can change children's behaviours and weight status over the short- or medium-term; however, there is far less evidence on which to judge the impact over the longer term. early prevention and treatment of childhood and adolescent obesity is mandated. due in part to suboptimal weight loss with lifestyle intervention alone, bariatric surgery, combined with ongoing lifestyle changes, has become a favorable approach in adolescents with severe obesity and weight-related comorbidities and is associated with effective weight loss and reducing weight-related comorbidities. although several intervention programs for children result in weight loss or stabilisation in the short term, preventing relapse after weight loss remains an important challenge. participation in multicomponent weight-management programs can positively influence self-esteem in children and adolescents affected by overweight or obesity; however, the variety of questionnaires used to assess self-esteem makes it difficult to compare changes across and identify effective interventions. these data may have implications for the weight loss-independent management of cardiometabolic risk in pediatric populations. to date, several attempts to achieve weight loss in children have been made, but little is known about their effects on improving eating behaviours. |||",Yes
Can music therapy help people affected by stroke learn to walk normally again?,Yes,"Evidence suggests that music-supported therapy (MST) can be a feasible intervention for patients with acute stroke, improving motor, cognitive, and psychosocial functions. In line with this, musical rhythmicity has been observed to improve post-stroke gait. Individualized in-patient rehabilitation interventions that rhythmically pair patient-selected music with rehabilitative interventions have been shown to improve balance and gait in patients with stroke. Furthermore, music-based therapy for rehabilitation has been found to induce neuromodulation at the brain level and improve functional recovery. Arrhythmic music listening has been shown to modulate spinal excitability during post-stroke walking, restoring the CPQ reflex activity to normality. Therefore, it can be concluded that music therapy can help people affected by stroke learn to walk normally again.","what is the state of knowledge and evidence for a role of music in supporting the rehabilitation of movements after stroke? we investigated effects of music-supported therapy (mst) in chronic stroke on motor, cognitive, and psychosocial functions compared to conventional physical training (grasp). conclusion: incorporating patient-selected music with in-patient physical rehabilitation may be a feasible intervention for patients with acute stroke. in order to explore the plasticity effects of music-supported therapy, this therapeutic intervention was applied to twenty chronic stroke patients. the purpose of this article is to educate nurses about music therapy and provide evidence for the therapeutic use of music in the rehabilitation setting for victims of stroke. on one hand, repetitive task-specific approaches with higher intensities of walking have been observed to result in greater improvements of gait after stroke. in line with this, musical rhythmicity improves post-stroke gait. individualized in-patient rehabilitation interventions improve balance and gait in patients with stroke. objective: to describe an in-patient rehabilitation intervention that rhythmically paired patient-selected music with rehabilitative interventions for a patient with acute stroke. in this brief perspective, i provide background context and information about stroke recovery in general, in order to spark reflection and discussion for how we think music may impact motor recovery, given the current clinical milieu. recovery of the sit-to-stand (sts) movement early after stroke could be improved by targeting physical therapy at the underlying movement deficits in those people likely to respond. robotic-assisted walking training after stroke aims to enhance the odd of regaining independent gait. patients affected by mild stroke benefit more from physiological overground walking training than walking-like training performed in place using specific devices. to compare the effects of an early treatment protocol of add-on robot-assisted gait training with add-on conventional overground physiotherapy for improving locomotion in non-ambulatory adult stroke patients. music-based therapy for rehabilitation induces neuromodulation at the brain level and improves the functional recovery. arrhythmic music listening modulates the spinal excitability during post-stroke walking, restoring the cpq reflex activity to normality. we raised the question whether music with irregular tempo (arrhythmic music), and its possible influence on attention would induce neuromodulation and improve the post-stroke gait. the ability to walk is commonly reported as a top rehabilitation priority for individuals after a stroke. our results support the hypothesis that an early treatment protocol of robot-assisted gait retraining is not superior to add-on conventional gait training intervention for improving locomotion in non-ambulatory stroke patients. background: stroke can result in disabling impairments, affecting functional mobility, balance, and gait. |||",Yes
Does plant or animal protein have an influence on lifespan?,Yes,"The context suggests that both the level and source of dietary protein can influence lifespan. Optimal lifespan requires a balance of high carbohydrate and low protein consumption, and the ratio of protein to carbohydrate in the diet can affect longevity. Proteins from plant-based sources may have different effects on cardiovascular disease risk factors compared to animal-based sources. The level of dietary protein also influences life-history traits and fitness, including the onset of reproduction and offspring growth and maturation. Furthermore, oxidatively modified proteins have been shown to correlate with the age of an organism or its tissues. Therefore, it can be inferred that both the level and source of dietary protein can have an influence on lifespan.","disruption of any one of these genes increased lifespan up to 90% independent of food intake suggesting the perceived value of dietary protein is a critical determinant of its effect on lifespan. we show that optimal lifespan requires both high carbohydrate and low protein consumption, but neither nutrient by itself entirely predicts lifespan. however, how protein source (e.g., animal compared with plant protein) affects energy expenditure, appetite, and food intake as we age is unknown. the level of dietary protein determines the onset of reproduction, affects offspring growth and maturation, and hence influences life-history traits and fitness. in drosophila, while a substantial body of research suggests that protein is the major dietary component affecting longevity, recent studies claim that carbohydrates also play a central role. an increase in tissue-susceptibility to experimentally induced protein oxidation not only depends on tissue type and age, but also on the maximum lifespan potential of the species. proteins from plant-based compared with animal-based food sources may have different effects on cardiovascular disease (cvd) risk factors. while many studies have shown that nad(+) is important when lifespan is modulated by dietary means, it is uncertain whether or how nad(+) affects either formation or elimination of altered proteins. increased consumption of animal-derived protein is often advocated as a strategy to support physical performance in old age. this study demonstrates that the level of dietary protein influences the life-history of r. d. chakae in predictable ways. the pubmed database was searched for both chronic and acute interventional studies, as well as observational studies, in healthy humans or those with metabolic dysfunctions, in which the impact of animal and plant protein intake was compared while using the following variables: cholesterolemia and triglyceridemia, blood pressure, glucose homeostasis, and body composition. it has recently been demonstrated that as the ratio of protein to carbohydrate (p:c) in the diet declines, life span increases in drosophila. here we explored how extremely low dietary ratios of protein to carbohydrate affected longevity and a selection of variables associated with functional senescence. diets higher in protein have been reported to improve age-related changes in body composition via increased energy expenditure, shifts in substrate oxidation (so), and decreased appetite. there was a significant effect of time, age, and protein source on appetite (p < 0.05). to assess the relationship of protein consumption and specific protein sources with physical function in older adults. numerous epidemiologic and intervention studies have evaluated their respective health benefits; however, it is difficult to isolate the role of plant or animal protein on cvd risk. dietary protein is derived from many food sources, and each provides a different composite of nonprotein compounds that can also affect cvd risk factors. life-history theory predicts that nutrition influences lifespan owing to trade-offs between allocating resources to reproduction, growth and repair. oxidatively modified proteins have been shown to correlate with the age of an organism or its tissues. |||",Yes
Can probiotics prevent diarrhea after treatment with antibiotics?,Yes,"Justification: The context suggests that certain probiotic microorganisms have been shown to reduce the risk of antibiotic-associated diarrhea. Probiotics may prevent this type of diarrhea by restoring the gut microflora and normalizing an unbalanced gastrointestinal flora. Several studies have demonstrated the benefits of probiotics in treating various diarrheal disorders, including antibiotic-associated diarrhea. However, it is important to note that the evidence supporting the use of probiotics for this purpose is limited to certain microorganisms. Therefore, while probiotics may be useful in preventing diarrhea after treatment with antibiotics, further research is needed to confirm their efficacy and determine the most effective strains and dosages.","some studies indicate that the risk of antibiotic-associated diarrhea can be reduced by administration of certain probiotic microorganisms. probiotics may prevent antibiotic-associated diarrhea (aad) via restoration of the gut microflora. probiotics may be of benefit in treating acute infectious diarrhea and reducing antibiotic-associated diarrhea. the role of probiotics in the prevention and treatment of antibiotic-associated diarrhea, clostridium difficile diarrhea, and recurrent c. difficile diarrhea is reviewed. probiotic bacteria have well-established beneficial effects in the management of diarrhoeal diseases. the results suggest a strong benefit of probiotic administration on antibiotic-associated diarrhoea, but further data are needed. to evaluate the evidence for probiotic use in the prevention and treatment of antibiotic-associated diarrhea (aad). the role of probiotics in treating or preventing diarrheal diseases is well known. patients receiving oral probiotics had more reported diarrhea in the first and second weeks of treatment. convincing evidence that probiotic administration can lower the risk of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea is limited to certain micro-organisms. probiotics are living microorganisms, which, upon oral ingestion, may prevent antibiotic-associated diarrhea (aad) by the normalization of an unbalanced gastrointestinal flora. one condition for which probiotics have been advocated is the diarrhea that is a common adverse effect of antibiotic use. several studies have shown that probiotics are of benefit in gastrointestinal infections, including viral diarrhea, clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea, traveler's diarrhea, and antibiotic-associated diarrhea. therefore, probiotic preparations are used to prevent this diarrhoea. diarrhea is a common side effect of treatment with antibiotics. some studies suggest a role for probiotics as supplemental treatment, in combination with antibiotics, for the aforementioned disease processes. randomized, parallel, controlled (placebo, active, or no treatment) trials comparing co-administered probiotics with antibiotics for the prevention of diarrhea secondary to antibiotic use in children (0 to 18 years). a common adverse effect of antibiotic use is diarrhea. clinical studies have shown that certain probiotics may be useful in treating a variety of diarrheal disorders, including rotavirus diarrhea, antibiotic-associated diarrhea, clostridium difficile diarrhea, and traveler's diarrhea. to conduct a meta-analysis of the data in the literature on the efficacy of probiotics in the prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea. |||",Yes
Is exercise an effective measure to combat depression?,Yes,"Exercise has been shown to be an effective treatment for depression. It has been well-established as a treatment for depression, with both consumers and clinicians supporting its use in clinical care. Exercise has been found to be an efficacious treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD) and has been shown to have anti-inflammatory effects in non-depressed subjects. Studies have shown that exercise of any intensity can significantly improve feelings of depression, and it has been found to be associated with a greater reduction in depression symptoms compared to no treatment, placebo, or active control interventions such as relaxation or meditation. Exercise has also been studied as a potential antidepressant, with most studies supporting its efficacy. The use of exercise as a symptom management tool to improve mood in depression has been recommended, with even light exercise being an effective recommendation. The efficacy of physical exercise as an augmentation to pharmacotherapy with antidepressants for depressive patients has been documented. Exercise has also been shown to improve cardiorespiratory fitness and reduce depressive symptoms in people with depression.","is exercise an effective treatment for depression? exercise can be an effective treatment for depression. exercise is a well-established treatment for depression, and its use in clinical care is supported by consumers and clinicians. exercise as a treatment for depression carries both potential benefit for depressive symptoms and risk for adverse events. exercise is an efficacious treatment for major depressive disorder (mdd) and has independently been shown to have anti-inflammatory effects in non-depressed subjects. to acutely improve depressed mood, exercise of any intensity significantly improved feelings of depression with no differential effect following light, moderate, or hard exercise. exercise is associated with a greater reduction in depression symptoms compared with no treatment, placebo, or active control interventions, such as relaxation or meditation. exercise has been studied as a potential antidepressant, with most studies supporting its efficacy. previous observational and interventional studies have suggested that regular physical exercise may be associated with reduced symptoms of depression. acute exercise should be used as a symptom management tool to improve mood in depression, with even light exercise an effective recommendation. although currently available evidence suggests that physical exercise can be beneficial for depressed patients and might be comparable to antidepressant treatment, the best way of implementing this recommendation in clinical practice is not known. exercise effectively improves mood in major depressive disorder (mdd), but the optimal exercise stimulus to improve depressed mood is unknown. exercise also has the potential to reduce the risk for physical comorbidities that occur with depression. the efficacy of physical exercise as an augmentation to pharmacotherapy with antidepressants for depressive patients has been documented. research has shown that aerobic exercise is effective in alleviating depression. the following review aims at presenting the contemporary literature regarding the nature of depression, exercise, the underlying mechanisms and the management of an exercise program in individuals with depression. exercise, a subset of physical activity, influences a range of biological and psychosocial processes also implicated in the pathophysiology of depression. sample size; lack of an exercise only treatment arm conclusions: adding exercise to antidepressant drug treatment may offer significant advantages over affective symptoms of depression, rather than somatic symptoms or other dimensions of depression. physical exercise is increasingly recognized as a treatment for major depression, even among older patients. exercise improves cardiorespiratory fitness (crf) and reduces depressive symptoms in people with depression. |||",Yes
Can a tantrum trigger a heart attack?,Yes,"Justification: The context suggests that emotional stress can trigger cardiac events, such as acute coronary syndrome, which is often characterized by myocardial stunning of neurogenic origin. This is supported by the frequent antecedent of emotional or physical stress, suggesting a catecholamine-mediated mechanism. Furthermore, psychological stress is identified as a trigger in 16% of cases of sudden cardiac death. A tantrum, being a sudden and intense emotional outburst, can be considered a form of psychological stress. Therefore, it is plausible that a tantrum could trigger a heart attack.","various physical, emotional, and extrinsic triggers have been attributed to acute coronary syndrome. the most accepted theory proposes myocardial stunning of neurogenic origin, supported by the frequent antecedent of emotional or physical stress, suggesting a catecholamine-mediated mechanism. it was suggested that either a sudden loss of catecholamine stimulation or myocardial damage caused by the direct action of the tetanus toxin, could be involved in cardiac dysfunction described in tetanus. the cardiovascular manifestations of tetanus consist of disturbances of heart rate and rhythm, blood pressure instability, arrhythmias, myocardial dysfunction and sympathetic overactivity. right ventricular myocardial infarction can lead to cardiogenic shock and death. since it is well known that myocardial damage caused by catecholamines can induce synthesis of cytokines by myocytes, cytokines, specifically those with known cardiodepressant properties such as tnf-alpha, could be an alternative mechanism involved in cardiac dysfunction in the setting of tetanus. this study was undertaken to determine whether thickening of the atrioventricular (av) node artery is a cause of sudden cardiac death. physical exertion was found to be the most dominant trigger (65%) followed by psychological stress (16%) and acute illness (12%). we report a fatal case of tetanus in which we investigated the cardiac morphology and the expression of tnfalpha to elucidate the heart involvement in this case. tako-tsubo-like cardiomyopathy (ttc) is much more common than originally thought. acute physical and emotional triggers were identified in patients' historical data. congenital long-qt (lqt) syndrome can lead to torsades de pointes (tdp), which can deteriorate into ventricular fibrillation resulting in sudden death. it is uncertain whether external electrical cardioversion (cv) of atrial fibrillation (af) can cause myocardial injury identifiable by troponin i (ctni). although previous works have shown that ta could cause vasodilation in an endothelial cell (ec)-dependent manner, there is hitherto no report showing whether ta could raise ec cytosolic ca2+ concentration. thickening of the av node artery has been implicated as a cause of sudden death primarily on the basis of case reports. in 10 subjects with sudden death a dysplastic av node artery was narrowed > 2 sd over the control value; half of this subgroup died during exercise and one third had a family history of sudden unexplained cardiac death. the hypothesis concerning ergotamine-induced vasospasm potentially being able to trigger a tongue necrosis in gca is supported by the present case. dysplasia of the av node artery may contribute to death in a substantial portion of patients with unexplained sudden death, and such death is often associated with exercise and a family history of unexplained sudden death. in conclusion, tanning--a behavior with well-known health risks--is a relatively frequent bdd-related behavior. the response to antitachycardia pacing can sometimes reveal clues about tachycardia mechanisms. |||",Yes
Does regular consumption of coffee increase the risk of heart disease such as heart attack or stroke?,No,"The context suggests that heavy coffee consumption has been associated with an increased risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) and acute myocardial infarction or coronary death. Chronic coffee consumption may also exert a detrimental effect on aortic stiffness and wave reflections, which may increase the risk of cardiovascular disease. However, it is important to note that moderate coffee consumption is unlikely to adversely affect cardiovascular health for most healthy people. The adverse effects of chronic coffee consumption on traditional risk factors for CHD are less consistent, with coffee intake slightly increasing blood pressure and plasma concentrations of homocysteine and cholesterol, but with no association with the incidence of hypertension and a strong negative association with the incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus. In meta-analyses of recent well-controlled prospective epidemiologic studies, coffee-consumption was not associated with risk of coronary heart disease and weakly associated with a lower risk of stroke and heart failure.","some epidemiological data relate chronic coffee intake to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. clinical and observational studies have recently reported that coffee consumption is associated with cardiac arrhythmia, with increased serum cholesterol, blood pressure and affected heart rate variability, leading to an increased cardiovascular risk. heavy coffee consumption has been associated with increased coronary heart disease (chd) risk although many studies have not observed any relation. chronic coffee consumption exerts a detrimental effect on aortic stiffness and wave reflections, which may increase the risk of cardiovascular disease. for many years, an association between coffee consumption and the risk of coronary heart disease has been suspected. we examined prospectively the relation of coffee consumption with the risk of myocardial infarction, need for coronary-artery bypass grafting or angioplasty, and risk of stroke in a cohort of 45,589 u.s. men who were 40 to 75 years old in 1986 and who had no history of cardiovascular disease. in conclusion, heavy coffee consumption increases the short-term risk of acute myocardial infarction or coronary death, independent of the brewing method or currently recognized risk factors for chd. in the past, coffee was often viewed as a cardiovascular risk-factor. in summary, for most healthy people, moderate coffee consumption is unlikely to adversely affect cardiovascular health. these findings do not support the hypothesis that coffee or caffeine consumption increases the risk of coronary heart disease or stroke. this review examines the effects of coffee on cardiovascular risk, outlines underlying biological mechanisms, and discusses implications for public health. in this work, we evaluated the association between coffee consumption and the risk of developing acute coronary syndromes, based on a random sample of 848 patients with their first coronary heart disease event and 1078 frequency-matched controls with no cardiovascular disease in their medical history, from the entire country. in the current paper, we discuss the acute and long-term cardiovascular effects of coffee, and its major constituents, which could underlie such an association. coffee is one of the most widely consumed beverages, and some studies have suggested it may be related to cardiovascular disease (cvd), the leading cause of poor health in the world. heavy coffee consumption increases the incidence of acute coronary events in men with low but not high comt activity. this review evaluates the evidence on the effect of habitual coffee consumption on cvd incidence and mortality. consumption of scandinavian-style ""boiled coffee"" is associated with coronary heart disease. we postulate that coffee drinking may have an acute detrimental effect in triggering coronary events and increasing infarct size in selected patient groups, rather than promoting the development of atherosclerosis in the general population, and we propose an alternative approach to explore such an effect in epidemiological studies. the adverse effects of chronic coffee consumption on traditional risk factors for chd are less consistent: although coffee intake slightly increases blood pressure, and plasma concentrations of homocysteine and cholesterol, there is no association with the incidence of hypertension, and a strong negative association with the incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus. however, in meta-analyses of recent well-controlled prospective epidemiologic studies, coffee-consumption was not associated with risk of coronary heart disease and weakly associated with a lower risk of stroke and heart failure. |||",No
Do cesarean babies have a higher risk of becoming overweight later in life?,Yes,"The study suggests that children born by cesarean delivery have a higher risk of being overweight throughout childhood compared to those delivered vaginally. The odds of being overweight are 1.52 times higher for cesarean-born children. The study also indicates that women born by cesarean delivery may have a higher risk of being obese and developing type 2 diabetes during adult life. The results show a greater likelihood of obesity at age 2 years in the cesarean delivery group compared with the vaginal delivery group. However, this association was not observed at older ages. The proportion of obese children was greater in the cesarean delivery group compared with the vaginal delivery group at age 2 years, but not at older ages. Mothers who gave birth by cesarean delivery had a higher mean prepregnancy body mass index, greater mean gestational weight gain, and shorter mean duration of exclusive breastfeeding compared with those who delivered vaginally.","compared with children delivered vaginally, children delivered by cesarean had a 52% higher risk of being overweight throughout childhood, but this was not accompanied by a higher blood pressure in adolescence. cesarean delivery is associated with an increased risk of childhood obesity in offspring. what this study adds caesarean section is associated with an increased risk of childhood overweight. cesarean delivery may increase the risk of obesity in early childhood. children born by caesarean delivery on maternal request are also more likely to be overweight. children born by cesarean delivery (n = 236, 8.9%) had a 1.52 (95% ci 1.18, 1.96) higher odds of being overweight throughout childhood than children delivered vaginally. this study suggests that women born by cesarean delivery may have a higher risk than women born by vaginal delivery of being obese and developing type 2 diabetes during adult life. to investigate whether children delivered by cesarean had a higher risk of being overweight from early until late childhood and whether they had a higher blood pressure in adolescence compared with children delivered vaginally. a few small-scale studies suggest that caesarean section may be associated with later overweight and obesity, whereas little is known about the impact of caesarean delivery on maternal request. to investigate whether birth by cesarean delivery rather than vaginal delivery is a risk factor for later childhood obesity. caesarean delivery including non-medically indicated maternal request caesarean delivery compared with vaginal delivery modestly increases childhood overweight risk. associations between cesarean delivery and being overweight or obese were investigated at age 2, 6, and 10 years (n = 1734, 1244, and 1170, respectively) by multivariate logistic regression models adjusted for socioeconomic status, child characteristics, and maternal prepregnancy characteristics. regression analyses revealed a greater likelihood of obesity at age 2 years in the cesarean delivery group compared with the vaginal delivery group at age 2 years (aor, 1.68; 95% ci, 1.10-2.58), but not at age 6 years (aor, 1.49; 95% ci, 0.55-4.05) or age 10 years (aor, 1.16; 95% ci, 0.59-2.29). our results do not support the hypothesis that an increasing rate of cesarean delivery contributes to obesity in childhood. infants born heavy are vulnerable to later obesity, but it is unknown whether obesity-related risk factors present between conception and delivery predict their postnatal weight trajectory. caesarean section should also increase the risk of obesity related cardiovascular risk factors if type of delivery is associated with obesity later in life. the proportion of obese children was greater in the cesarean delivery group compared with the vaginal delivery group at age 2 years (13.6% vs 8.3%), but not at older ages. greater antenatal weight or body mass index (bmi) gains may lead to larger fetuses and thus increase the risk for operative deliveries, such as cesarean deliveries. women born by cesarean delivery were more likely to be classified as obese and to have received a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes during follow-up. mothers who gave birth by cesarean delivery (∼17%) had a higher mean prepregnancy body mass index (23.7 kg/m(2) vs 22.5 kg/m(2)), greater mean gestational weight gain (15.3 kg vs 14.5 kg), and shorter mean duration of exclusive breastfeeding (3.4 months vs 3.8 months) compared with those who delivered vaginally. |||",Yes
Does the pregnancy hormone hCG help with weight loss?,No,"The context provided suggests that the use of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) hormone in conjunction with diet for weight loss has not been found to have an advantage over diet alone in rats. Additionally, the context indicates that the prevention of gestational weight loss has been a priority for clinicians, and recent work suggests that gestational weight loss may be beneficial for obese mothers. However, the context does not provide evidence to support the claim that hCG specifically aids in weight loss. Therefore, based on the information provided, it is not accurate to state that hCG helps with weight loss.","recently, it has been observed that weight loss is accelerated by human chorionic gonadotropin (hcg) hormone preparation used for hypothalamic dysfunction in obesity treatment in both sexes. this study aimed to determine whether prepregnancy weight loss reduces gestational weight gain and improves pregnancy outcomes. although the prevention of gestational weight loss (gwl) has become a priority for clinicians in the past few decades, recent work has suggested that gwl may be beneficial for obese mothers. administering hcg in addition to diet had no advantage on weight reduction in rats. health professionals should be aware that gwg may offset the expected effect of weight loss before conception on fetal growth in overweight and obese women. although the intervention group successfully lost weight before conception, the intervention group was associated with greater weight gain in late pregnancy. for women with bmi < 25 kg/m2 at conception, birth weight was significantly higher with weight loss than stable weight before pregnancy (β = 0.08 [95% ci 0.02; 0.14], p = 0.01), and this total effect was explained by a significant mediating effect through gwg. even a small reduction in body weight can improve ovulatory function and pregnancy rate and reduce adverse obstetric outcomes. our aim was to observe the ultrastructural changes caused by local injections of hcg made for purpose of weight loss and to present them to inform those receiving such therapy. previous studies indicated that hcg could be responsible for the pregnancy-induced protection against breast cancer in women. participants in the intervention group lost more weight before pregnancy than those in the control group (-0.25±0.51 vs -0.03±0.21 kg/wk; p<.001). women are often advised that lactation accelerates loss of the excess weight gained during pregnancy, but the evidence underlying this advice is sparse and conflicting. pregnancy interventions to limit gestational weight gain (gwg) have been proposed as a means of preventing hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (hdp); however, it is currently unclear whether gwg has a causal influence on the development of hdp. weight retention after pregnancy may contribute to obesity. weight retention after pregnancy may contribute to obesity. to investigate whether gestational weight loss (gwl) after the diagnosis of gestational diabetes mellitus (gdm) in overweight and obese women is associated with improved perinatal outcomes. in overweight and obese women with gdm, third trimester weight loss is associated with some improved maternal and neonatal outcomes, although this effect is lessened by increased odds of sga status and preterm delivery. women who have an overweight or obese pre-pregnancy body mass index (bmi) may be recommended to lose weight before pregnancy, however the association of preconception weight fluctuations and prenatal adherence to nutrition and exercise recommendations with gestational weight gain (gwg) have not been assessed. women with elevated body mass index are encouraged to lose weight before pregnancy, but no trials have tested the effects of prepregnancy weight loss on health outcomes. preconceptional weight loss appears beneficial to fetal growth, but some effects of previous obesity were retained in offspring phenotype. |||",No
Does pelvic floor training help women with stress-related urinary incontinence?,Yes,"Pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) has been shown to be an effective treatment for stress urinary incontinence (SUI) in women. PFMT is the most commonly used physical therapy treatment for SUI and is recommended as first-line therapy for female patients with SUI.

PFMT has been shown to improve the quality of life (QOL) in women with SUI, and feedback or biofeedback may provide additional benefit. The mechanism of action of PFMT for SUI is not fully understood, but it is thought to involve improvements in the function of the pelvic floor muscles and the urethral sphincter.

Can treatment with tea tree oil relieve pimples (acne)?,Yes,"The use of tea tree oil for the treatment of acne vulgaris has been suggested by a study, which aimed to evaluate the clinical evidence on its use for treating acne. Tea tree oil is a popular antimicrobial agent and is recommended for the treatment of acne vulgaris, a disease of the pilosebaceous unit. Topical 5% tea tree oil has been found to be an effective treatment for mild to moderate acne vulgaris. Tea tree oil possesses broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity and is increasingly used for skin problems. Over-the-counter acne treatments containing tea tree oil are widely available and are a common choice amongst those self-treating their acne. The essential tea tree oil has been widely used in modern medicine and cosmetics in recent years, and several published studies have demonstrated its antibacterial activity. However, it is important to note that oxidation of tea tree oil can result in degradation products, such as ascaridole, which may cause allergic contact dermatitis. Therefore, it is recommended to use tea tree oil with caution and to consult with a healthcare professional before use.","one study has suggested the efficacy of tea tree oil in treatment of the acne vulgaris. to determine the efficacy of tea tree oil in mild to moderate acne vulgaris. the aims of this review were to collate and evaluate the clinical evidence on the use of tea tree oil products for treating acne, to review safety and tolerability and to discuss the underlying modes of therapeutic action. tea tree oil, a popular antimicrobial agent is recommended for the treatment of acne vulgaris, a disease of the pilosebaceous unit. topical 5% tea tree oil is an effective treatment for mild to moderate acne vulgaris. tea-tree oil possesses broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity, and is increasingly used for skin problems. over-the-counter acne treatments containing tea tree oil from the plant melaleuca alternifolia are widely available, and evidence indicates that they are a common choice amongst those self-treating their acne. tea tree oil is popular for treating various cutaneous maladies. this is the first study to show experimentally that tea tree oil can reduce histamine-induced skin inflammation. these in vitro results suggest that tea-tree oil may be useful in the treatment of yeast and fungal mucosal and skin infections. tea tree oil is currently enjoying popularity as a 'cure-all' for a variety of skin conditions, from infections to psoriasis, and many household and personal products containing melaleuca oil are available. tea tree oil is used as a natural remedy, but is also a popular ingredient in household and cosmetic products. tea tree oil is a popular ingredient in complementary medicines and beauty products. tea-tree oil (oil of melaleuca alternifolia) has recently received much attention as a natural remedy for bacterial and fungal infections of the skin and mucosa. the essential tea tree oil has been widely used in modern medicine and cosmetics in recent years. as with most naturally occurring agents, claims of effectiveness have been only anecdotal; however, several published studies have recently demonstrated tea-tree oil's antibacterial activity. to investigate the anti-inflammatory properties of tea tree oil on histamine-induced weal and flare. at 20 min, 25 microl of 100% tea tree oil was applied topically to the study forearm of 21 volunteers. a positive reaction to ascaridole was related to a positive reaction to tea tree oil. oxidation of tea tree oil results in degradation products, such as ascaridole, which may cause allergic contact dermatitis. |||",Yes
Does electromagnetic radiation from cell phone towers cause health problems such as headaches or sleep disorders?,No,"The context suggests that there are concerns and ongoing debates regarding the potential health effects of electromagnetic radiation from cell phone towers. However, the consequences of long-term exposure to this radiation are still unknown. While some reports indicate that electromagnetic radiation may elicit biological effects, including headaches and sleep disorders, the available research data is limited. Therefore, it is not possible to definitively conclude that electromagnetic radiation from cell phone towers causes health problems such as headaches or sleep disorders. Further research is needed to fully understand the potential health impacts of this radiation.","various reports suggest that mobile phone use can cause health problems like fatigue, headache, dizziness, tension, and sleep disturbances; however, only limited research data is available in medical literature regarding interaction between electromagnetic fields emitted by mobile phones and auditory function; and the possible impact on hearing. there has been wide public discussion on whether the electromagnetic fields of mobile telephones and their base stations affect human sleep or cognitive functioning. people with self-attributed electromagnetic hypersensitivity (ehs) complain of subjective symptoms such as headaches, insomnia, and memory loss, and attribute these symptoms to radio frequency (rf) radiation from cellular phones and/or base stations. the widespread use of mobile telephones has given rise to concern about the potential influences of electromagnetic fields (emfs) on human health. the increased use of mobile phones worldwide has focused interest on the biological effects and possible health outcomes of exposure to radiofrequency fields from mobile phones, and their base stations. with the increasing use of mobile communication, concerns have been expressed about the possible interactions of electromagnetic radiation with the human organism and, in particular, the brain. with the number of cellular phone users rapidly increasing, there is a considerable amount of public concern regarding the effects that electromagnetic fields (emfs) from cellular phones have on health. background: electromagnetic pollution is a general health concern worldwide, as cell phone towers are ubiquitous and are located adjacent to or on the roof of schools, and hospitals. as the use of smart phones increases, social concerns have arisen concerning the possible effects of radio frequency-electromagnetic fields (rf-emfs) emitted from wideband code division multiple access (wcdma) mobile phones on human health. consequences of long-term exposure to the electromagnetic radiation caused by cell phone towers are still unknown and can potentially be a new health hazard. the debate regarding the health effects of low-intensity electromagnetic radiation from sources such as power lines, base stations, and cell phones has recently been reignited. abstract in the last years, it has been discussed frequently whether there are any harmful effects of electromagnetic fields on human health. there are several reports which indicate that electromagnetic radiation (such as from mobile phones) at non-thermal levels may elicit a biological effect in target cells or tissues. resulting from radio frequency (rf) radiation by cellular phones. there are public concerns regarding possible carcinogenic or cancer-promoting effects of radiofrequency electromagnetic fields (rf-emfs) because of the extensive use of wireless mobile phones and other telecommunication devices in daily life. this study aims to investigate the effects of electromagnetic fields induced by the global system for mobile communications (gsm) mobile phones on the thyroid stimulating hormone (tsh) and thyroid hormones in humans. this cross-sectional study evaluated the potential effect of electromagnetic radiation generated from various resources including cell phone towers on blood glutathione s transferase activity (e-gst) and total antioxidant activity of the jordanian population. possible effects of rf-emf exposure on human sleep were examined with regard to mobile phones and base stations, but not with regard to wi-fi exposure. mobile phone use is ubiquitous, although the alleged health effects of low level radio-frequency radiation (rfr) used in transmission are contentious. in the present review, the authors attempt to address the following question: is there epidemiologic evidence for an association between long-term cell phone usage and the risk of developing a brain tumor? |||",No
Can antibiotic-resistant germs from animal husbandry be transferred to humans?,Yes,"The context indicates that antibiotic-resistant bacteria and resistance genes can be transmitted from animals to humans through direct contact or via the food chain. This transfer may occur through the consumption of contaminated food products, direct contact with food-producing animals, or environmental spread. The use of antibiotics in animal husbandry selects for drug-resistant microorganisms, which can then be spread to humans. The intensive use of antimicrobials in animals may promote the fixation of antimicrobial resistance genes in bacteria, which may be zoonotic or capable of transferring these genes to human-adapted pathogens or to human gut microbiota via direct contact, food, or the environment. There are several examples of transfer of resistant bacteria or bacterial resistance genes from animals to humans via the food chain. Therefore, it is concluded that antibiotic-resistant germs from animal husbandry can be transferred to humans.","moreover, resistance genes can be transferred from bacteria of animals to human pathogens in the intestinal flora of humans. furthermore, antimicrobial-resistant bacteria and resistant genes can be transmitted from animals to humans either by direct contact or via the food chain. there is concern that antibiotic resistance can potentially be transferred from animals to humans through the food chain. moreover, resistant bacteria in animals can be transferred to people--usually through the consumption of food, but also through direct contact with food-producing animals or through environmental spread. resistant bacteria from animals may be passed to humans via the food chain or direct animal contact, and may result in resistant infections. while antibiotic treatments help cure infectious diseases in farm animals, the possibility of spreading antibiotic resistance genes into the environment and human microbiomes raises significant concerns. this review summarizes the current knowledge of the use of antimicrobial agents in animal health and explores the role of bacteria from animals as a pool of antimicrobial resistance genes for human bacteria. a potential concern about the use of antibiotics in animal husbundary is that, as antibiotic resistant bacteria move from the farm into the human diet, they may pass antibiotic resistance genes to bacteria that normally reside in a the human intestinal tract and from there to bacteria that cause human disease (reservoir hypothesis). in addition, concern has been raised for the potential transfer of resistance determinants from animals to humans through commensal bacterial flora such as escherichia coli. the potential for transmission of antibiotic-resistant enteric zoonotic bacteria from animals to humans has been a public health concern for several decades. it is widely accepted that the use of antibiotics in animal husbandry selects for drug resistant microorganisms, which are then spread from the farm environment to humans through the consumption of contaminated food products. the development of resistance in some human pathogens, such as methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and multi-drug resistant mycobacterium tuberculosis, is linked to the use of antimicrobials in man and there is no evidence for animal involvement. the development of resistance in some human pathogens, such as methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and multi-drug resistant mycobacterium tuberculosis, is linked to the use of antimicrobials in man and there is no evidence for animal involvement. the intensive use of antimicrobials in animals may promote the fixation of antimicrobial resistance genes in bacteria, which may be zoonotic or capable to transfer these genes to human-adapted pathogens or to human gut microbiota via direct contact, food or the environment. antimicrobial resistance is a growing problem in human medicine, and concern has been expressed that use of antimicrobials in animals may be a contributing factor. genomic investigation of specific resistance genes from the gut microbiomes of swine and cattle in this study should provide opportunities to better understand the exchange of antibiotic resistance genes in farm animals. treatment of food-producing animals with antimicrobial agents that are important in human therapy may present a public health risk by the transfer of resistant zoonotic pathogens or resistant genes from animals to humans via consumption of contaminated food. however, there are several good examples of transfer of resistant bacteria or bacterial resistance genes from animals to man via the food chain. however, there are several good examples of transfer of resistant bacteria or bacterial resistance genes from animals to man via the food chain. antimicrobial resistance is a growing concern for public and animal health. |||",Yes
Does regular vitamin D intake lower the risk of cancer in adults?,No,"The scientific literature supports the role of vitamin D in reducing the risk of several types of cancer, particularly colorectal cancer. Studies that include vitamin D from all sources or serum 25(OH)D3 usually show significantly reduced incidence of colorectal cancer in association with vitamin D. There is also evidence that higher circulating levels of vitamin D are associated with reduced risk of bladder malignancies and postmenopausal breast cancer. However, the available evidence provides only limited support for an inverse association between vitamin D status and the risk of other types of cancer. The maintenance of a sufficient vitamin D status might be a promising approach for the prevention and/or treatment of cancer.","vitamin d intake has been hypothesized to reduce the risk of several types of cancer. a diversity of scientific literature supports a role for vitamin d in decreasing colorectal cancer incidence, but the available evidence provides only limited support for an inverse association between vitamin d status and the risk of other types of cancer. there are substantial preclinical and epidemiologic data that suggest that vitamin d plays a role in the prevention and treatment of cancer. a number of mechanisms have been identified through which vitamin d may reduce the risk of colorectal and several other types of cancer. although studies that include vitamin d from all sources or serum 25(oh)d3 usually show significantly reduced incidence of colorectal cancer in association with vitamin d, analyses limited to dietary vitamin d tend to have mixed results. there is strong evidence from several different lines of investigation supporting the hypothesis that vitamin d may reduce the risk of colorectal cancer. studies that combine multiple sources of vitamin d or examine serum 25(oh)d3 usually find that above-average vitamin d intake and serum metabolite concentrations are associated with significantly reduced incidence of colorectal cancer. we investigated the relationship between vitamin d status, using circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin d [25(oh)d], and lung cancer risk in a nested case-control study within the alpha-tocopherol, beta-carotene cancer prevention study of finnish male smokers. the potential role of vitamin d in cancer prevention has generated substantial interest, and laboratory experiments indicate several anti-cancer properties for vitamin d compounds. there has been substantial enthusiasm recently regarding the potential role of vitamin d in the primary and secondary prevention of cancer. in this cohort of women with elevated risk, high serum 25(oh)d levels and regular vitamin d supplement use were associated with lower rates of incident, postmenopausal breast cancer over 5 y of follow-up. vitamin d has been hypothesized to reduce cancer mortality through its effects on incidence and/or survival. this review critically examines the currently available epidemiologic literature regarding the associations between circulating 25(oh)d, vitamin d supplementation, and vitamin d-related genetic variation and cancer risk and mortality, with a particular emphasis on prospective studies. ecologic studies and experimental data suggest that vitamin d may reduce ovarian cancer risk. higher circulating levels of vitamin d (i.e., 25-hydroxyvitamin d or 25(oh)d) appear to be associated with reduced risk of colorectal and bladder malignancies, but higher risk of prostate and possibly pancreatic cancers, with no clear association for most other organ sites examined. in summary, our data suggest that low levels of 25(oh)d are associated with increased risk of fatal cancer in patients referred to coronary angiography and that the maintenance of a sufficient vitamin d status might therefore be a promising approach for the prevention and/or treatment of cancer. a role for vitamin d in cancer risk reduction has been hypothesized, but few data exist for lung cancer. therefore, we examined whether plasma concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin d (a measure of overall vitamin d status) and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin d (biologically active form) were associated with risk of epithelial ovarian cancer in a nested-case control study using data from three prospective cohorts: the nurses' health study (nhs), nhsii, and the women's health study (whs). the physiological role of vitamin d extends beyond bone health and calcium-phosphate homeostasis to effects on cancer risk, mainly for colorectal cancer. patients deficient in vitamin d (less than 10.0 ng/ml) had increased colorectal cancer risk 19.2 fold compared to control. |||",No
1. can MMR vaccination cause autism?,No,"The available epidemiological and related evidence does not support a causal association between MMR vaccine and autism. Several studies have found no association between MMR vaccination and autism, including a study that found that MMR vaccine was not associated with an increased risk of autism even among high-risk children whose older siblings had autism. The hypothesis that MMR vaccines cause autism was first raised by reports of cases in which developmental regression occurred soon after MMR vaccination, but this has not been supported by scientific evidence. The belief that there is a link between the MMR vaccine and autism has led to a decline in childhood-immunization uptake and a resurgence of preventable infectious diseases.","we investigated whether mmr vaccination is associated with an increased risk of autism or other pervasive developmental disorders. the study strongly supports that mmr vaccination does not increase the risk for autism, does not trigger autism in susceptible children, and is not associated with clustering of autism cases after vaccination. it has been suggested that vaccination with the measles-mumps-rubella (mmr) vaccine causes autism. it has been suggested that vaccination, particularly with measles-mumps-rubella (mmr) vaccine, may be related to the development of autism. it has recently been suggested that mmr vaccine might cause autism, but that the induction interval need not be short. to evaluate whether the mmr vaccine increases the risk for autism in children, subgroups of children, or time periods after vaccination. the measles-mumps-rubella (mmr) vaccine has been postulated to cause a form of autism characterized by regression and bowel symptoms, and onset occurring shortly after vaccination. a report published in 1998, but subsequently retracted by the journal, suggested that measles, mumps, and rubella (mmr) vaccine causes autism. there is no proof that the overall risk of autism is higher in children who were vaccinated with mmr or of an increase in autism prevalence associated with the use of the mmr vaccine. despite research showing no link between the measles-mumps-rubella (mmr) vaccine and autism spectrum disorders (asd), beliefs that the vaccine causes autism persist, leading to lower vaccination levels. public fears of rising rates of children being diagnosed with autistic spectrum disorders has led to a fear that immunizations, specifically the measles-mumps-varicella vaccine (mmr), may trigger autism. case reports have described children who developed signs of both developmental regression and gastrointestinal symptoms shortly after mmr vaccination.a review of the literature revealed no convincing scientific evidence to support a causal relationship between the use of mmr vaccines and autism. several epidemiologic studies have not found an association between mmr vaccination and autism, including a study that found that mmr vaccine was not associated with an increased risk of autism even among high-risk children whose older siblings had autism. considerable concern has been generated in the lay and medical communities by a theory that increased measles-mumps-rubella (mmr) immunization among young children may be the cause of an apparent marked increase in autism occurrence. the hypothesis that mmr vaccines cause autism was first raised by reports of cases in which developmental regression occurred soon after mmr vaccination. a causal relationship between the measles, mumps, and rubella (mmr) vaccine and occurrence of autism spectrum disorders (asd) has been claimed, based on an increase in asd in the usa and the uk after introduction of the mmr vaccine. the hypothesized link between the measles, mumps, rubella (mmr) vaccine and autism continues to cause concern and challenge vaccine uptake. our results do not support this hypothesis, and provide further evidence against a causal association between mmr vaccination and autism. currently, the weight of the available epidemiological and related evidence does not support a causal association between mmr vaccine, or any other vaccine or vaccine constituent, and autism. the belief that there is a link between the mmr vaccine and autism has led to a decline in childhood-immunization uptake and a resurgence of preventable infectious diseases. |||",No
3. does vaccination against rotavirus increase the risk of intestinal intussusception in infants?,Yes,"The results of a systematic review and meta-analysis suggest that monovalent, pentavalent, monovalent human-bovine, oral bovine pentavalent, and human neonatal rotavirus vaccination was not associated with an elevated risk of intussusception among neonates or infants. Although some studies have shown an association between vaccination with the rotavirus vaccine and the development of intussusception, the risk of intussusception was not increased compared with infants who did not receive the rotavirus vaccine. In infants with intestinal failure, rotavirus vaccination appears to be safe and immunogenic. The hypothesis that rotavirus vaccines are associated with an increased risk of intussusception adverse events was tested, but no significant association was found. In some settings, rotavirus vaccines have been associated with a low-level risk of intussusception, but this has not been confirmed in large trials before licensure.","results of this systematic review and meta-analysis suggest that monovalent, pentavalent, monovalent human-bovine, oral bovine pentavalent, and human neonatal rotavirus vaccination was not associated with an elevated risk of intussusception among neonates or infants. currently available rotavirus vaccines have been associated with a small increased risk of intussusception (~1-2 cases per 100,000 vaccinated infants) in some populations. to evaluate the association between rotavirus vaccination and risk of intussusception. twenty cases of definite intussusception were diagnosed within 31 days after rotavirus vaccination, with 11 cases (55%) in the vaccine group and 9 cases (45%) in the placebo group (rd, 0.17 per 10 000 infants [95% ci, -1.16 to 1.50 per 10 000 infants], p = .80; rr, 1.14 [95% ci, 0.49 to 2.64], p = .77). to examine the risk of intussusception following pentavalent rotavirus vaccine (rv5) in us infants. in some settings, rotavirus vaccines have been associated with a low-level risk of intussusception, the most common cause of bowel obstruction in infants. although current rotavirus vaccines were not associated with an increased risk of intussusception in large trials before licensure, recent postlicensure data from international settings suggest the possibility of a small increase in risk of intussusception after monovalent rotavirus vaccination. several studies have shown an association between vaccination with the rotavirus vaccine and the development of intussusception. one concern about rotavirus vaccines is its possible association with intussusception. the hypothesis tested in the present study is that rotavirus vaccines are associated with an increased risk of intussusception adverse events (aes) characterized by an onset in a biologically plausible a priori identified temporal period post-vaccination (days 3 to 7). in addition, live oral rotavirus vaccines have been associated with intussusception. one concern about rotavirus vaccine, however, is a possible association with intussusception. we conducted a case-control study among children <2 years old in bangladesh, nepal, pakistan, and vietnam to evaluate infectious etiologies of intussusception before rotavirus vaccine introduction. among us infants aged 4 to 34 weeks who received rv5, the risk of intussusception was not increased compared with infants who did not receive the rotavirus vaccine. in infants with intestinal failure, rotavirus vaccination appears to be safe and immunogenic. using sequential analyses, we then compared the risk of intussusception among children receiving monovalent rotavirus vaccine with historical background rates. adenovirus has been associated with intussusception and slightly increased risk of intussusception with rotavirus vaccination has been found. intussusception, a rare adverse event associated with rotavirus vaccines in some settings, is a common cause of intestinal obstruction in infants and toddlers globally with a peak age of 4-6 months. possible relationship with a withdrawn tetravalent rotavirus vaccine was not confirmed by post-licensure studies and actually no increased risk of intussusception was found between infants vaccinated with both the recently licensed rotavirus vaccines. we describe the surveillance for intussusception in a phase iii clinical trial with an oral monovalent rotavirus vaccine developed from the neonatal 116e strain. |||",Yes
Do pumpkin seed preparations improve symptoms caused by a benign enlarged prostate?,No,"The context suggests that pumpkin seed preparations have been found to improve symptoms caused by a benign enlarged prostate. In a randomized, partially blinded, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial, the efficacy of pumpkin seed in men with lower urinary tract symptoms suggestive of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH/LUTS) was investigated. The results showed that 12 months of treatment with pumpkin seed led to a clinically relevant reduction in IPSS compared with placebo. Additionally, a randomized, double-blind study compared the preparation curbicin, obtained from pumpkin seeds and dwarf palm plants, with a placebo in the treatment of symptoms caused by prostatic hyperplasia. The results indicated that the oil-free hydroethanolic pumpkin seed extract was a well-tolerable and appropriate plant extract to support health benefits in a collective suffering from BPH-related symptoms without the need for medical treatment.","we conclude pumpkin seed oil can inhibit testosterone-induced hyperplasia of the prostate and therefore may be beneficial in the management of benign prostatic hyperplasia. pumpkin seeds are often used in traditional medicine in the management of erectile dysfunction. the cell growth inhibition for fast growing cells together with the cell growth inhibition of prostate-, breast- and colon cancer cells corroborates the ethnomedical use of pumpkin seeds for a treatment of benign prostate hyperplasia. the oil from the pumpkin (cucurbita pepo) seed is claimed to be useful in the management of benign prostatic hyperplasia. pumpkin seeds have been known in folk medicine as remedy for kidney, bladder and prostate disorders since centuries. practical applications: this study brought to limelight the medicinal importance of fluted pumpkin seed in erectile functions. moreover, due to the lack of androgenic activity, pumpkin seed applications can be regarded as safe for the prostate. the positive modulatory effect of the fluted pumpkin seed on these critical markers of erectile function could be attributed to its polyphenolics and amino acid constituents. this investigation seeks to examine the effect of pumpkin seed oil on testosterone-induced hyperplasia of the prostate of rats. overall, in men with bph, 12 months of treatment with pumpkin seed led to a clinically relevant reduction in ipss compared with placebo. the german research activities on natural urologicals (granu) study was a randomized, partially blinded, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial that investigated the efficacy of pumpkin seed in men with lower urinary tract symptoms suggestive of benign prostatic hyperplasia (bph/luts). numerous plants improve uncontrolled growth of the prostate gland and improve urinary tract symptoms associated with bph. testosterone significantly increased prostate size ratio (p < .05), and this induced increase was inhibited in rats fed with pumpkin seed oil at 2.0 mg/100 g of body weight. in this study, we evaluated the effect of the pumpkin seed oil from cucurbita maxima on urinary dysfunction in human overactive bladder (oab). in a single-arm, mono-center pilot study, the effects of a proprietary oil-free hydroethanolic pumpkin seed extract on the symptoms of bph were investigated. a total of 60 men (62.3 years [95% confidence interval (ci): 60.3-64.3 years]) with a total international prostate symptom score (ipss) of 14.8 (95% ci: 13.5-16.1) participated between january 2017 and october 2017 in the study by ingesting the oil-free hydroethanolic pumpkin seed extract once daily before going to bed during 3 months. hence, this study investigated the influence of fluted pumpkin seed on critical enzymes involved in erectile function in isolated rats' corpus cavernosum in vitro. the results from our study suggest that pumpkin seed oil extracts from c. maxima as well as from c. pepo are effective for urinary disorders such as oab in humans. in a randomised, double-blind study, the preparation curbicin, obtained from pumpkin seeds and dwarf palm plants (cucurbita pepo l. and sabal serrulata), was compared with a placebo in the treatment of symptoms caused by prostatic hyperplasia; 53 patients took part in the study, which was carried out over a 3-month period. these results indicate that the oil-free hydroethanolic pumpkin seed extract seems to be a very well tolerable, appropriate plant extract to support health benefits in a collective suffering from bph related symptoms without the need of medical treatment. |||",No
Can serious problems occur after stopping antidepressants?,Yes,"The discontinuation of antidepressants can lead to a variety of withdrawal reactions, including dizziness, weakness, nausea, headache, lethargy, insomnia, anxiety, poor concentration, and paresthesias. These symptoms can start within a few days to a few weeks after ceasing the drug and persist for days to weeks. Rapid discontinuation of some psychotropic medications is also associated with an increased risk of early illness recurrence. While serious problems are rare, they can occur, and patients should be closely monitored during the discontinuation process. Additionally, the long-term use of antidepressants may impair recovery and increase the risk of rehospitalization in patients with both primarily affective and non-affective disorders. Therefore, it is important to consider the potential risks and benefits of discontinuing antidepressants and to work closely with a healthcare provider to develop a safe and effective plan for discontinuation.","because the symptoms of antidepressant discontinuation include changes in mood, affect, appetite, and sleep, they are sometimes mistaken for signs of a relapse into depression. adverse discontinuation effects can occur with all types of antidepressant drugs, but only rarely would they be considered serious. adverse effects are common, occur early on in treatment and are reported to be one of the main reasons for discontinuation of antidepressant treatment. premature discontinuation of antidepressant drugs is a frequent clinical problem. however, whether due to ignorance about the chronicity of depression, intolerable adverse effects, or an inappropriate fear of dependence, antidepressants are often discontinued after remission or recovery from an acute episode, which frequently leads to relapse or recurrence. the results suggest that the contribution of side effects to antidepressant discontinuation is more complex than previously suggested. patients with major depression discontinue taking their antidepressants for many reasons. the authors compared illness recurrence after rapid versus gradual discontinuation of antidepressants. antidepressants can cause a variety of withdrawal reactions, starting within a few days to a few weeks of ceasing the drug and persisting for days to weeks. rapid discontinuation of some psychotropic medications is followed by discontinuation symptoms as well as an increased risk of early illness recurrence. serotonergic antidepressant drugs are sometimes associated with a distinct discontinuation syndrome characterized by dizziness, weakness, nausea, headache, lethargy, insomnia, anxiety, poor concentration, and paresthesias. following remission of an anxiety disorder or a depressive disorder, antidepressants are frequently discontinued and in the case of symptom occurrence reinstated. the side effects of antidepressants are important because they influence treatment process, patients' satisfaction with treatment and adherence to medications. understanding the particular pharmacology of different antidepressant drugs can help explain their adverse effects when they are discontinued. because of side effects correction of daily dosage of antidepressants is required in some cases, and sometimes therapy with particular antidepressant must be stopped. conclusions: our findings raise the possibility that, in the long-term, antidepressants may impair recovery and increase the risk of rehospitalisation in patients with both primarily affective and non-affective disorders. background: some evidence suggests that antidepressants may relate to poor outcomes in depression. sudden or tapered withdrawal from treatment with antidepressants, including monoamine oxidase inhibitors (maois), tricyclic antidepressants (tcas), and serotonin selective reuptake inhibitors (ssris), can produce phenomena consisting of somatic and psychological symptoms. antidepressants were discontinued clinically, either rapidly (over 1-7 days; n=188) or gradually (over 14 days or more; n=210), with a mean follow-up duration of 2.8 years; patients who were ill at discontinuation were excluded from the analysis. despite the efficacy of currently available antidepressant treatment, residual symptoms are common among individuals treated for major depressive disorder and are associated with an increased risk of relapse and poor psychosocial functioning. |||",Yes
Do unsaturated fats (from plants and fish) reduce cardiovascular disease compared to saturated fats (from meat and dairy products)?,Yes,"Numerous studies have indicated that diets high in unsaturated fatty acids, particularly polyunsaturated fats, are associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular disease. These fats, which include omega-3 fatty acids found in fish and certain plant sources, have been shown to decrease blood cholesterol concentrations and reduce atherosclerosis more effectively than diets high in saturated or even monounsaturated fats. The consumption of omega-3 fatty acids, in particular, has been linked to lower rates of cardiovascular disease in epidemiological studies. These fatty acids, found in fish and fish oils, have been shown to protect against coronary heart disease and are inversely associated with cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality. Diets enriched with omega-3 polyunsaturated fish oils have been associated with a lower risk of atherosclerotic vascular disease. In contrast, diets high in saturated fats, typically found in meat and dairy products, have been linked to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease.","diets high in unsaturated fatty acids have been recommended to lower the risk of cardiovascular disease. currently, diets higher in polyunsaturated fat are believed to lower blood cholesterol concentrations, and thus reduce atherosclerosis, greater than diets containing high amounts of saturated or possibly even monounsaturated fat. diets enriched with omega-3 unsaturated fatty acids are associated with decreased hypercholesterolemia and decreased risk of ischemic and atherosclerotic diseases. dietary unsaturated fatty acids appear to reduce the incidence of these events, in particular polyunsaturated fatty acids (pufas), which exert markedly different effects on risk factors related to heart disease. a high dietary intake of omega-3 fatty acids has been strongly linked to lower rates of cardiovascular disease in epidemiologic studies. omega-3 (omega-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids (pufas) from fish and fish oils appear to protect against coronary heart disease: their dietary intake is in fact inversely associated with cardiovascular disease morbidity/mortality in population studies. epidemiological studies in the last 40 years suggest that omega-3 fatty acids derived from fish and fish oil decrease the risk of coronary heart disease, hypertension and stroke, and their complications. increased consumption of n-3 (omega-3) fatty acids decreases the incidence of coronary heart disease (chd). diets enriched with n-3 polyunsaturated fish oils, predominantly eicosapentaenoic acid, are associated with a lower risk of atherosclerotic vascular disease. a diet rich in fish and ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (pufas) has been thought to reduce the risk for cardiovascular disease (cvd). the fish diet resulted in decreased serum triglyceride and increased hdl-cholesterol concentrations (1.0 +/- 0.11 and 1.23 +/- 0.05 mmol/l, respectively) compared with the control diet (1.12 +/- 0.11 and 1.19 +/- 0.05 mmol/l, respectively) and the walnut diet (1.11 +/- 0.11 mmol/l, p < 0.05, and 1.18 +/- 0.05 mmol/l, p < 0.001, respectively). the aim of the present study was to investigate whether n-3 lcpufa-enriched food products provide similar beneficial effects as fish oil with regard to incorporation into plasma lipids and effects on cardiovascular risk markers. accumulating evidence demonstrates that dietary intake of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (pufas) is associated with reduced incidence of cardiovascular events. including walnuts and fatty fish in a healthy diet lowered serum cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations, respectively, which affects chd risk favorably. consumption of fish rich in n-3 highly unsaturated fas (i.e., epa and dha) has been suggested to decrease the risk of lifestyle-related diseases such as coronary heart disease, cancer, diabetes, and dementia. there is some evidence that intake of sea food rich in n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (pufa) may protect against coronary heart disease (chd). diets rich in ω3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (ω3-pufas) such as alpha-linolenic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid, and docosahexaenoic acid are associated with decreased incidence and severity of several chronic diseases including cardiovascular disease (cvd) and cancer. dietary fats play a critical role in atherogenesis and thrombosis. the objective was to determine whether walnuts (plant n-3 fatty acid) and fatty fish (marine n-3 fatty acid) have similar effects on serum lipid markers at intakes recommended for primary prevention of chd. dietary fatty acids have cholesterol lowering, antiatherogenic, and antiarrhythmic properties that decrease the risk of myocardial infarction (mi). |||",Yes
Is a vegetarian diet including eggs and dairy products healthier than a diet that includes meat?,Yes,"A vegetarian diet that includes eggs and dairy products, also known as a lacto-ovo-vegetarian diet, is generally considered healthier than a diet that includes meat. This is due to the fact that vegetarian diets are associated with lower intakes of energy, saturated fatty acids, and animal protein, and higher intakes of fiber and phytochemicals, compared to omnivorous diets. The consumption of plant proteins rather than animal proteins by vegetarians may contribute to their reduced risk of chronic diseases such as diabetes and heart disease. Additionally, vegetarian diets are usually rich in carbohydrates, n-6 fatty acids, dietary fiber, carotenoids, folic acid, vitamin C, vitamin E, and magnesium, and relatively low in protein, saturated fat, long-chain n-3 fatty acids, retinol, vitamin B(12) and zinc. While meat intake has been related to increased risk for a variety of chronic diseases, an abundant consumption of vegetables, fruits, cereals, nuts, and legumes all have been independently related with a lower risk for several chronic degenerative diseases, such as ischemic heart disease, diabetes, obesity, and many cancers.","some vegetarians also consume eggs and dairy foods. a growing body of scientific evidence indicates that wholesome vegetarian diets offer distinct advantages compared to diets containing meat and other foods of animal origin. eggs and dairy products also provide protein for those following a lacto-ovo-vegetarian diet. in western countries, vegetarian diets are associated with lower intakes of energy, saturated fatty acids and animal protein and higher intakes of fibre and phytochemicals, compared to omnivorous diets. in terms of nutrients, vegetarian diets are usually rich in carbohydrates, n-6 fatty acids, dietary fibre, carotenoids, folic acid, vitamin c, vitamin e and mg, and relatively low in protein, saturated fat, long-chain n-3 fatty acids, retinol, vitamin b(12) and zn; vegans may have particularly low intakes of vitamin b(12) and low intakes of ca. vegetarian diets do not contain meat, poultry or fish; vegan diets further exclude dairy products and eggs. the consumption of plant proteins rather than animal proteins by vegetarians may contribute to their reduced risk of chronic diseases such as diabetes and heart disease. compared with other vegetarian diets, vegan diets tend to contain less saturated fat and cholesterol and more dietary fiber. a vegetarian diet is associated with many health benefits because of its higher content of fiber, folic acid, vitamins c and e, potassium, magnesium, and many phytochemicals and a fat content that is more unsaturated. the aim of the current study was to investigate this metabolism in lacto-ovo vegetarians whose diet is less strict, allowing the ingestion of eggs and milk. the fat content of the vegan diet is significantly lower and the polyunsaturated:saturated fatty acid ratio higher than in the omnivore diet. a vegetarian diet usually provides a low intake of saturated fat and cholesterol and a high intake of dietary fiber and many health-promoting phytochemicals. while meat intake has been related to increased risk for a variety of chronic diseases, an abundant consumption of vegetables, fruits, cereals, nuts, and legumes all have been independently related with a lower risk for several chronic degenerative diseases, such as ischemic heart disease, diabetes, obesity, and many cancers. although the vegetarian lifestyle could lead to a better health status in adults, it may also bear risks for certain nutritional deficiencies. overall, lacto-ovo-vegetarian children consume diets closer to recommendations than omnivores and their pre-pubertal growth is at least as good. protein intake of vegans is lower than that in omnivores. non-vegetarian diets were compared to vegetarian dietary patterns (i.e., vegan and lacto-ovo-vegetarian) on selected health outcomes. well planned vegetarian diets effectively meet recommended dietary allowances and are a 'healthy' alternative to meat eating. when a vegetarian diet is appropriately planned and includes fortified foods, it can be nutritionally adequate for adults and children and can promote health and lower the risk of major chronic diseases. cross-sectional studies of vegetarians and vegans have shown that on average they have a relatively low bmi and a low plasma cholesterol concentration; recent studies have also shown higher plasma homocysteine concentrations than in non-vegetarians. |||",Yes
Can washing hands with antibacterial soaps or wash lotions containing triclosan or triclocarban prevent the risk of contracting diseases in the household?,No,"The use of antibacterial soaps or wash lotions containing triclosan or triclocarban has not been scientifically proven to prevent the risk of contracting diseases in the household. A double-blinded, randomized clinical trial of hands of primary caretakers in 238 inner city households showed that antibacterial product use did not lead to a significant increase in antimicrobial drug resistance after 1 year, nor did it have an effect on bacterial susceptibility to triclosan. Although there was an increasing trend in the association between triclosan and bacterial susceptibility to antibiotic, there was no statistically significant association. Additionally, both agents have a risk of bacterial resistance, which is higher for chlorhexidine than triclosan. Therefore, it is not conclusive that handwashing with soap is more effective at reducing contamination with bacteria associated with diarrhea than using water only.","consumer antibacterial soaps contain triclosan or triclocarban. a double-blinded, randomized clinical trial of hands of primary caretakers in 238 inner city households was conducted in which effects of plain or antimicrobial (containing 0.2% triclosan) handwashing soap on bacterial counts of the hands were compared before and after a single wash and before and after handwashing following a year of product use. the possible association between triclosan and bacterial susceptibility to antibiotic was examined among staphylococci and several species of gram-negative bacteria (gnb) isolated from the hands of individuals in a community setting. hand cultures from individuals randomized to using either antibacterial cleaning and hygiene products (including a hand soap containing 0.2% triclosan) or nonantibacterial cleaning and hygiene products for a 1-year period were taken at baseline and at the end of the year. no scientific data have been published to suggest that the use of antibacterial agents in household products prevents infection, and triclosan resistance mechanisms have recently been identified. triclosan and triclocarban (tcs) are broad-spectrum antimicrobials that, until recently, were found in a wide variety of household and personal wash products. we examined whether household use of antibacterial cleaning and hygiene products is an emerging risk factor for carriage of antimicrobial drug-resistant bacteria on hands of household members. triclosan and triclocarban (tcs) are broad-spectrum microbicides found in household and personal wash products. antibacterial product use did not lead to a significant increase in antimicrobial drug resistance after 1 year (odds ratio 1.33, 95% confidence interval 0.74-2.41), nor did it have an effect on bacterial susceptibility to triclosan. still, a relationship may emerge after longer-term or higher-dose exposure of bacteria to triclosan in the community setting. although randomization to tc-containing wash products was not associated with decreased infectious disease reports by mothers, tcs were associated with decreased antibiotic prescriptions, suggesting a benefit against bacterial infection. hand washing with soap is a practice that has long been recognized as a major barrier to the spread of disease in food production, preparation, and service and in health care settings, including hospitals, child care centers, and elder care facilities. although there was no statistically significant association between triclosan mics and susceptibility to antibiotic, there was an increasing trend in the association the odds ratios (ors) for all species were compared at baseline (or = 0.65, 95% confidence interval [95%ci] = 0.33 to 1.27) versus at the end of the year (or = 1.08, 95%ci = 0.62 to 1.97) and for gnb alone at baseline(or = 0.66, 95%ci = 0.29 to 1.51) versus the end of year (or = 2.69, 95%ci = 0.78 to 9.23) regardless of the hand-washing product used. additionally, both agents have a risk of bacterial resistance, which is higher for chlorhexidine than triclosan. handwashing with soap reduces the transmission of diarrheal pathogens, but access to hand-washing facilities, water, and soap in humanitarian emergencies is limited. handwashing with soap reduces diarrhea risk, but drying hands on contaminated towels can compromise the benefits of handwashing. handwashing with regular soap and water is often considered sufficient, but what of hygienic handwash and handrub antiseptic products? effects of use of either soap, synthetic detergent, or triethanolamine (tea)-soap/ glycerin were compared at two water temperatures. tcs from wash products, primarily liquid and bar soaps, did not affect thyroid function measures during pregnancy or babies' anthropometric measures at delivery. however it is not conclusive that handwashing with soap is more effective at reducing contamination with bacteria associated with diarrhoea than using water only. |||",No
Does homeopathy work better than a placebo?,No,"The claim that homeopathy works better than a placebo is not definitively supported by the provided context. While some studies suggest that homeopathy may have greater efficacy than placebo in certain conditions, such as major depressive disorder (MDD) and premenstrual syndrome/dysphoric disorder, other studies have found no difference between homeopathy and placebo in MDD and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Additionally, an international multicenter study found that homeopathy was not superior to placebo in reducing 24-hour morphine consumption after knee ligament reconstruction. Therefore, the evidence is mixed and further research is needed to determine the effectiveness of homeopathy compared to placebo.","homeopathic remedies produce different symptoms than placebo. in this study a promising trend was observed that symptoms reported by some homeopaths may not be completely attributable to placebo. recent meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials in homeopathy have suggested that homeopathy is more than a placebo response. through its relation with biomedicine, its doctrine, consultation design, and treatment rituals, homeopathy offers a powerful medium to elicit a placebo response in a therapeutic alliance. we aimed to assess whether the clinical effect reported in randomised controlled trials of homeopathic remedies is equivalent to that reported for placebo. we bracket the issue of biochemical effectiveness of homeopathic remedies as we only discuss homeopathy's potential to elicit a placebo response within its therapeutic alliance, in virtue of its social, symbolic, and material features. an international multicenter, prospective, observational study in a real world medical setting comparing the effectiveness of homeopathy with conventional medicine. conventional scientific wisdom dictates that homeopathy should have no effect above and beyond placebo but experiments on ultra-high dilutions of solutes together with some clinical data suggest the intriguing possibility that it might do in some circumstances. despite, a long debate is continuing whether homeopathy is just a placebo or more than it, homeopathy has been considered to be safe and cost-effectiveness therapeutic modality. if true, this would support an effect of homeopathic medicines different from that of placebo. homeopathy showed greater efficacy in mdd compared with fluoxetine, and in premenstrual syndrome/dysphoric disorder compared with placebo, whereas no difference emerged between homeopathy and placebo in mdd and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder. the review is based on literature discussing homeopathic effectiveness, including historical, biographical, sociological, and epistemological perspectives. homeopathy seems scientifically implausible, but has widespread use. the complex of homeopathy tested in this study was not superior to placebo in reducing 24 h morphine consumption after knee ligament reconstruction. homeopathy appeared to be at least as effective as conventional medical care in the treatment of patients with the three conditions studied. to test whether homeopathic preparations produce different symptoms than placebo in healthy volunteers. from this phenomenon, it is possible to deduce a hypothesis: homeopaths should be able to distinguish a homeopathic medicine from a placebo by taking both and observing their effects. comparison of the effectiveness of homeopathy in primary care with conventional medicine in primary care for three commonly encountered clinical conditions. we discuss homeopathy's placebo effect as the result of a distributed therapeutic agency involving humans, objects, and texts. research in homeopathy has traditionally addressed itself to defining the effectiveness of homeopathic potencies in comparison to placebo medication. |||",No
Does toothpaste containing xylitol reduce the risk of caries?,Yes,"The context provided does not explicitly mention the use of xylitol in toothpaste or its effect on caries prevention. However, the context does indicate that xylitol has been shown to reduce the risk of dental caries when used in food, chewing gum, and lozenges. The context also mentions that xylitol is a well-known anticaries agent and has been used for the prevention and treatment of dental caries. Therefore, it is plausible that toothpaste containing xylitol could potentially reduce the risk of caries, but further research is needed to confirm this.","data from recent studies indicate that xylitol can reduce the occurrence of dental caries in young children, schoolchildren, and mothers, and in children via their mothers. xylitol, a polyol sugar, has been shown to reduce dental caries when mixed with food or chewing gum. xylitol, an over-the-counter sweetener, has shown some potential as a caries preventive agent, but the evidence for its effectiveness is not yet conclusive and is based largely on studies in child populations. an overview of studies about xylitol and dental caries suggests potential clinical dental applications for xylitol. xylitol is a safe dental caries preventive when incorporated into chewing gum or confections used habitually. xylitol is known to reduce caries by inhibiting the growth of streptococcus mutans. during the 5 years after habitual gum-chewing ended, xylitol gums reduced the caries risk 59% (rr, 0.41; 95% c.i., 0.23 to 0.75; p < 0.0034). xylitol-sorbitol gums reduced the caries risk 44% (rr, 0.56; 95% c.i., 0.36 to 0.89; p < 0.02). many mechanisms have been proposed to explain the caries preventive effect of xylitol as a total or partial dietary sugar substitute. xylitol is a well-known anticaries agent and has been used for the prevention and treatment of dental caries. xylitol has been widely documented to have dental health benefits, such as reducing the risk for dental caries. habitual xylitol gum-chewing may have a long-term preventive effect by reducing the caries risk for several years after the habitual chewing has ended. an effective xylitol-based caries prevention intervention would represent an easily disseminated method to extend caries prevention to individuals not receiving caries preventive treatment in the dental office. one new completed trial confirmed that children of mothers who used xylitol lozenges after delivery had less dental caries than a comparison group. the goal of this paper is to identify and assess the work on xylitol and other polyols and dental caries since 2008. aside from decreasing dental caries, xylitol may also decrease the transmission of s. mutans from mothers to children. xylitol has been shown to reduce plaque acids, but its topical cariostatic effect has been equivocal. the results suggest that in relatively low-caries conditions the school-based use of xylitol/maltitol or erythritol/maltitol lozenges would not have additional caries-preventive effect when compared with comprehensive prevention. the newly discovered synergistic antivital effect of xylitol combined with chlorhexidine may contribute to the favorable potential of xylitol use for the improvement of new formulations of caries-preventive mouthrinses. the long-term caries risk reduction associated with xylitol strongly depended on when teeth erupted (p < 0.02). |||",Yes
Does chocolate have a mood-lifting effect?,No,"The context suggests that chocolate has been shown to have a mood-lifting effect, particularly in improving negative mood states. This effect is thought to be due to the palatability of chocolate, as well as its interactions with neurotransmitters that contribute to mood modulation and appetite regulation. However, the relationship between chocolate and mood is complex and may also be influenced by factors such as emotional eating and the satisfaction of cravings. Further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms behind chocolate's mood-altering properties.","chocolate appears to increase positive mood, but particularly when it is eaten mindfully. the effect of food substances on emotional states has been widely investigated, showing, for example, that eating chocolate is able to reduce negative mood. the effect of chocolate on mood too has long been recognised. the present studies demonstrate that eating a small amount of sweet food improves an experimentally induced negative mood state immediately and selectively and that this effect of chocolate is due to palatability. eating chocolate reduced negative mood compared to drinking water, whereas no or only marginal effects were found on neutral and positive moods. in both experiments, chocolate-induced mood improvement was associated with emotional eating. we review chocolate's properties and the principal hypotheses addressing its claimed mood altering propensities. participants who were instructed to mindfully eat chocolate had a greater increase in positive mood compared to participants who were instructed to eat chocolate non-mindfully or crackers either mindfully or non-mindfully. to test the hypothesis that some foods are eaten to alter mood, the relationship between mood and intake of chocolate was investigated in 40 women. experiment 2 (113 normal-weight and healthy women and men) compared effects of eating palatable and unpalatable chocolate on negative mood, and examined the duration of chocolate-induced mood change. the relationship between chocolate and mood are highly complex, combining psychopharmacological components, nutritional and sensory characteristics of the food. chocolate is thought to have interactions with neurotransmitters which contribute to mood modulation and appetite regulation. as more is known about the influence of chocolate on mood, the reasons for these effects appear increasingly complex and inter-related. the association between chocolate consumption and emotions warrants further multi-prong investigations to substantiate chocolate's mood alterating propensity. negative mood was improved after eating palatable chocolate as compared to unpalatable chocolate or nothing. chocolate can provide its own hedonistic reward by satisfying cravings but, when consumed as a comfort eating or emotional eating strategy, is more likely to be associated with prolongation rather than cessation of a dysphoric mood. in this work two hypotheses were tested: (1) that eating a piece of chocolate immediately affects negative, but not positive or neutral mood, and (2) that this effect is due to palatability. popular claims confer on chocolate the properties of being a stimulant, relaxant, euphoriant, aphrodisiac, tonic and antidepressant. experiment 1 (48 normal-weight and healthy women and men) examined the effects of eating a piece of chocolate and drinking water on negative, positive and neutral mood states induced by film clips. chocolate consumption is anecdotally associated with an increase in happiness, but little experimental work has examined this effect. |||",Yes
Is belly fat or is a large abdominal girth particularly dangerous for health?,No,"Abdominal fat, often referred to as belly fat, is particularly harmful to health. This is due to its strong association with various metabolic and cardiovascular diseases, as well as certain types of cancer. Abdominal obesity, or central obesity, is considered more adverse than overall obesity because of its link to insulin resistance and increased cardiovascular risk. The presence of excess fat in the abdominal area contributes to many metabolic disorders, including metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases. The abdominal visceral fat depot is considered the most atherogenic, diabetogenic, and hypertensiogenic fat depot in the human body. The high levels of abdominal visceral fat observed in some adults are of critical importance in the metabolic complications of obesity. Therefore, it is accurate to state that belly fat or a large abdominal girth is particularly dangerous for health.","abdominal fat is particularly harmful and is associated with cardiovascular and metabolic diseases and cancer. although overall obesity does confer a significant threat to the health of individuals, the distribution of body fat, especially abdominal/central obesity is of greater importance. abdominal obesity, also known as central obesity, refers to the presence of excess fat in the abdominal area. human adiposity has long been associated with insulin resistance and increased cardiovascular risk, and abdominal adiposity is considered particularly adverse. abdominal overfat is the most unhealthful form of this condition, so it is concerning that average waist circumference measures, generally indicative of abdominal overfat, have increased. obesity, especially abdominal obesity, contributes to many metabolic disorders including metabolic syndrome (mets), type 2 diabetes (t2dm) and cardiovascular diseases (cvd). recent reports have shown that a high ratio of waist to hip circumference (whr) may be associated with a high proportion of intra-abdominal fat. a risk factor for incisional hernia, related to body composition, is obesity. abdominal and, in particular, visceral adiposity is strongly linked to insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidaemia, sleep apnea, and other complications of obesity. the abdominal visceral fat depot is considered to be the most atherogenic, diabetogenic and hypertensiogenic fat depot of the human body. given the critical role of abdominal visceral fat in the metabolic complications of obesity, it will now be important to identify the gene responsible for the high levels of abdominal visceral fat observed in some adults and to investigate whether this gene is the same as that which influences total body fat content. the prevalence of overfat populations in 30 of the world's most developed countries is substantially higher than recent global estimations, with the largest growth due to a relatively recent increased number of people with excess abdominal fat. the problem exists in most overweight and obese individuals and can also occur in those who are normal-weight and non-obese, often due to excess abdominal fat. however, some studies suggest that deep sc abdominal fat may have adverse properties. obesity, defined as excess fat mass, increases risks for multiple chronic diseases, such as type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and several types of cancer. pathological accumulation of body fat can cause many health problems: insulin resistance, impaired glucose tolerance, and diabetes mellitus type 2. excess body fat is associated with cardiometabolic dysfunction, a clinical situation that can progressively worsen, potentially leading to various common disease risk factors, chronic diseases, increased morbidity and mortality, and reduced quality of life. a high percentage of body fat is considered to be the primary cause of risks associated with high body weight. obesity, defined as excess fat mass, increases risks for multiple metabolic diseases, such as type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease and several types of cancer. abdominal visceral fat area was assessed by computerized tomography in 382 adult men and women from 100 families of the québec family study. |||",Yes

These proteins can cause allergic reactions, including baker's asthma, wheat-dependent exercise-induced anaphylaxis, atopic dermatitis, and celiac disease. The context also mentions that wheat can accumulate high levels of cadmium, posing a significant health hazard. Nonetheless, without specific information on wheat lectin, it is not possible to definitively state whether it is harmful to health.","wheat is a common food causing allergy which has implications on the quality of life. wheat is an important staple food and potent allergen source. wheat is an important part of the daily diet of millions of people. wheat is one of the most consumed foods in the world and unfortunately causes allergic reactions which have important health effects. exposure to dietary wheat proteins in genetically susceptible individuals has been associated with increased risk for the development of type 1 diabetes (t1d). owing to its extensive use in the human diet, wheat is among the most common causes of food-related allergies and intolerances. wheat, one of the most broadly cultivated and consumed food crops worldwide, can accumulate high cd contents in their edible parts, which poses a major hazard to human health. wheat grain is a major staple of our diet. gliadin from wheat is a common food allergen that can induce baker's asthma, wheat-dependent exercise-induced anaphylaxis, atopic dermatitis, and celiac disease. wheat is one of the most important crops in the world in terms of human nutrition. wheat is one of the world's most widely consumed staple food. however, proteins derived from wheat grain have been implicated in both respiratory and food allergies, as well as in contact hypersensitivity. for a small proportion of the population, specific wheat proteins can trigger adverse immune responses and clinical manifestations such as celiac disease, wheat allergy, baker's asthma, and wheat-dependent exercise-induced anaphylaxis (wdeia). this review discusses what is currently known about wheat grain proteins and allergens. with regards to health, some individuals exhibit wheat-related disorders such as food allergy to wheat (faw). allergic reactions to wheat may be caused by ingestion of wheat containing foods or inhalation of flour (bakers asthma). allergies to wheat are provoked by ingestion, inhalation or contact with either the soluble or the insoluble gluten proteins in wheat. background: it is important to analyze the presence of wheat/gluten in food to avoid wheat allergy or celiac disease. gluten proteins, and particularly the gliadin fraction, are also the main factor triggering celiac disease, a common enteropathy induced by ingestion of wheat gluten proteins and related prolamins from oat, rye and barley in genetically susceptible individuals. the consumption of wheat, rye, and barley may cause adverse reactions to wheat such as celiac disease, non-celiac gluten/wheat sensitivity, or wheat allergy. |||",No
Can stevia lower high blood pressure?,Yes,"The study indicates that stevia, specifically Stevia rebaudiana, has demonstrated antihypertensive effects in both human and animal models. This is achieved through its ability to reduce the cardiac action potential duration at 20%, 50%, and 90% of repolarisation. Furthermore, stevia has shown beneficial modulatory effects on cardiovascular and gastrointestinal tissues via calcium channel antagonism, activation of the m2 muscarinic receptor function, and enhanced nitric oxide release. In cardiomyocytes, stevia has been observed to attenuate the force of contraction, decrease the average peak amplitude, and shorten the repolarisation phase of the action potential. The study also notes that stevia caused relaxation of aortic tissues, which was significantly potentiated in the presence of verapamil. These findings suggest that stevia may play a role in lowering high blood pressure.","antihypertensive and antidiabetic effects of stevia, stevia rebaudiana (asteraceae), have been demonstrated in several human and animal models. this study is the first to show the effectiveness of stevia in reducing cardiac action potential duration at 20 %, 50 %, and 90 % of repolarisation. stevia also showed beneficial modulatory effects on cardiovascular and gastrointestinal tissues via calcium channel antagonism, activation of the m2 muscarinic receptor function, and enhanced nitric oxide release. in cardiomyocytes, stevia attenuated the force of contraction, decreased the average peak amplitude, and shortened the repolarisation phase of action potential - repolarisation phase of action potential20 by 25 %, repolarisation phase of action potential50 by 34 %, and repolarisation phase of action potential90 by 36 %. the current study aims to define stevia's role in modifying the electrophysiological and mechanical properties of cardiomyocytes, blood vessels, and gastrointestinal smooth muscle. the regulation of blood pressure by dietary means represents an important approach toward the reduction of morbidity and mortality of heart disease. cardiovascular complications may, to a large extent, be prevented by lowering blood pressure in hypertensive patients. stevia caused relaxation of aortic tissues which was significantly potentiated in the presence of verapamil. in mesenteric arteries, incubation with l-name failed to block stevia-induced relaxation indicating the mechanism of action may not be fully via nitric oxide-dependent pathways. thus, the method used to lower blood pressure may be important. reduction of high blood pressure has an effect on coronary mortality and morbidity lower than expected. this paper reviews the evidence for the blood pressure-lowering effects of a vegetarian diet on those with elevated blood pressure. the effects of stevia (1 × 10-9 m to 1 × 10-4 m) were measured on these tissues. to test if spironolactone or dietary nitrate from beetroot juice could reduce arterial stiffness as aortic pulse wave velocity (pwvart), a potential treatment target, independently of blood pressure. in hypertensive subjects, cardiovascular risk reduction is critically related to the decrease of systolic blood pressure (sbp). the results of our dietary intervention studies demonstrated that a lowered saturated fat, higher polyunsaturated fat diet had a lowering effect on both systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and a lowering effect on blood lipids. reduction of high blood pressure has, by itself, an anti-atherogenic effect, but, for some anti-hypertensive drugs, there is experimental and clinical evidence of anti-atherogenic properties. stevia's effects in the presence of verapamil, 4-ap, and l-name were also assessed. as a consequence of altering the diet, we have found that the blood pressure lowering effect appears to be mediated through linoleic acid (n-6). reduction of sodium intake lowers blood pressure in many patients with essential hypertension. |||",Yes
Does consumption of dairy products in middle and advanced age protect against bone fractures?,No,"The study suggests that higher milk and dairy food consumption are associated with a lower risk of hip fracture in older adults. The results indicate that greater intakes of milk and milk + yogurt may lower the risk for hip fracture in older adults through mechanisms that are partially, but not entirely, attributable to effects on bone mineral density. The findings show that total dairy food intake, of which milk contributed about half, was associated with a significant 6% lower risk of hip fracture per daily serving in men and women. The results also suggest a positive association of dairy intake with appendicular bone mineralization and muscle mass in elderly women.","the purpose of this study was to examine the association between dairy-product intake and hip fracture among a national sample of women aged 50 years and older. because many fractures in this age group are of the appendicular skeleton often associated with falls, dairy intake may be a modifiable lifestyle factor contributing to healthy aging. in this group of older us adults, higher milk consumption was associated with a lower risk of hip fracture. these results suggest that greater intakes of milk and milk + yogurt may lower risk for hip fracture in older adults through mechanisms that are partially, but not entirely, attributable to effects on bone mineral density. dairy foods are rich in bone-beneficial nutrients, yet the role of dairy foods in hip fracture prevention remains controversial. background: previous studies showed beneficial effects of specific dairy foods on bone health in middle-aged adults.objective: we examined the association of milk, yogurt, cheese, cream, fluid dairy (milk + yogurt), and milk + yogurt + cheese intakes with bone mineral density (bmd) and 4-y percentage of change in bmd [▵%bmd; femoral neck, trochanter, and lumbar spine (ls)]. the purpose of this study was to examine whether higher milk and dairy food consumption are associated with risk of hip fracture in older adults following a report of an increased risk for milk in swedish women. the objective of this study was to review existing literature on the effects of dairy products and total dietary calcium on bone integrity in children and young adults to assess whether evidence supports (1) current recommended calcium intake levels and (2) the suggestion that dairy products are better for promoting bone integrity than other calcium-containing food sources or supplements. we evaluated the association between intake of dairy foods and peripheral bone structure and muscle mass in 564 elderly women aged 80 to 92 (mean 84.7) years, who were participants of the calcium intake fracture outcome study/caifos aged extension study (caifos/cares) cohort and attended the 10-year follow-up. milk, cheese, yogurt) is advocated for bone health across the lifespan to reduce the risk of low-trauma fractures. univariate analyses using sas procedures showed dairy-product intake was significantly associated with hip fracture. total dairy food intake, of which milk contributed about half, was associated with a significant 6% lower risk of hip fracture per daily serving in men and women (rr = 0.94, ci 0.90 to 0.98). participants with medium (>1 and <7 servings/wk) or higher (≥7 servings/wk) milk intake tended to have lower hip fracture risk than those with low (≤1 serving/wk) intake (high versus low intake hr 0.58, 95% confidence interval [ci] 0.31-1.06, p = 0.078; medium versus low intake hr 0.61, 95% ci 0.36-1.08, p = 0.071; p trend = 0.178]. some previous evidence have linked dairy products with greater muscle mass, bone mineral density and lower risk of osteoporosis. numerous nutrition policy statements recommend the consumption of 800 to 1500 mg of calcium largely from dairy products for osteoporosis prevention; however, the findings of epidemiologic and prospective studies have raised questions about the efficacy of the use of dairy products for the promotion of bone health. our results suggest a positive association of dairy intake with appendicular bone mineralization and muscle mass in elderly women. a medline (national library of medicine, bethesda, md) search was conducted for studies published on the relationship between milk, dairy products, or calcium intake and bone mineralization or fracture risk in children and young adults (1-25 years). the objective of this review was to determine whether scientific evidence supports the recommendation that dairy foods be consumed daily for improved bone health in the general us population. studies were reviewed that examined the relation of dairy foods to bone health in all age, sex, and race groups. cox proportional hazards models were used to calculate the relative risks (rr) of hip fracture per daily serving of milk (240 ml) and other dairy foods that were assessed every 4 years, controlling for other dietary intakes, bmi, height, smoking, activity, medications, and disease diagnoses. |||",No
Can eating grapefruit in combination with some medications lead to harmful interactions?,Yes,"Ingesting grapefruit or its juice in conjunction with certain medications can indeed lead to harmful interactions. This is primarily due to the presence of furanocoumarins in grapefruit, which are known to interact with a variety of medications. These interactions can affect the metabolism of certain drugs, particularly those metabolized via the intestinal cytochrome p450 (CYP) 3A enzymes. This can result in either an increase or decrease in the systemic exposure of these medications, potentially leading to adverse effects or reduced efficacy. Prominent medications known to interact with grapefruit include statins, antiarrhythmic agents, immunosuppressive agents, and calcium channel blockers. It is important to note that the variable composition of grapefruit juice and the individual patient's response can make it difficult to predict the exact magnitude and clinical consequences of these interactions. Therefore, caution is advised when consuming grapefruit or its juice during drug therapy, especially when the drug has a narrow therapeutic margin or carries a risk of serious dose-dependent adverse effects.","in practice, numerous drugs interact with grapefruit juice. drugs interacting with grapefruit and inducing serious clinical consequences (confirmed or very probable) include: immunosuppressants, some statins, benzodiazepines, most calcium channel blockers, indinavir and carbamazepine. several serious adverse effects involving drug interactions with grapefruit juice have been published in detail. grapefruit juice can increase or decrease the systemic exposure of myriad oral medications, leading to untoward effects or reduced efficacy. in spite of known health benefits of grapefruit juice, its consumption in combination with drugs requires caution. biomedical evidence in the last 10 years has, however, shown that consumption of grapefruit or its juice is associated with drug interactions, which, in some cases, have been fatal. unprocessed grapefruit can cause a drug interaction with felodipine. concomitant administration of grapefruit juice can increase the plasma concentration of numerous drugs in humans and decrease the concentration of a few others. this review is designed to provide a comprehensive summary of underlying mechanisms of interaction and human clinical trials performed in the area of grapefruit drug interactions and to point out possible replacements for drugs with a high potential for interactions. although only a few reports involving severe clinical consequences have been published, they suggest that grapefruit juice should be avoided during drug therapy, especially when the drug has a narrow therapeutic margin or carries a risk of serious dose-dependent adverse effects. these alternative drugs may be substituted if a patient experiences or is at risk of a grapefruit-drug interaction. however, since the early 1990s, the potential health benefits of grapefruit have been overshadowed by the possible risk of interactions between drugs and grapefruit and grapefruit juice. although furanocoumarins in grapefruit juice can interact with certain oral medications, noninteracting medications generally can be substituted. prominent medications known to interact with grapefruit include statins, antiarrhythmic agents, immunosuppressive agents, and calcium channel blockers. characteristics of oral medications that may interact with grapefruit include extensive metabolism through the intestinal cytochrome p450 3a4 system, low bioavailability, and a narrow therapeutic index. grapefruit is a rich source of flavonoids but also contains furanocoumarins, which are known to strongly interact with a variety of medications. one of the most prominent food-drug interactions is the inhibition of intestinal cytochrome p450 (cyp) 3a enzymes by grapefruit juice ingredients, and, as many drugs are metabolized via cyp 3a, this interaction can be of clinical importance. along with the variable composition of grapefruit juice, this makes it difficult to predict the magnitude and clinical consequences of drug interactions with grapefruit juice in a given patient. since the late 1980s, grapefruit juice has been known to affect the metabolism of certain drugs. any therapeutic concern for a drug interaction with commercial grapefruit juice should now be extended to include whole fruit and possibly confectioneries made from grapefruit peel. |||",Yes
Can regular consumption of chocolate prevent cardiovascular disease?,Yes,"Previous epidemiological studies have suggested that regular consumption of chocolate may reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. Chocolate, particularly dark chocolate, contains high levels of stearic acid and antioxidant flavonoids, which have been shown to have potential beneficial effects on heart disease. Chocolate has been associated with decreased risks of coronary heart disease, stroke, and diabetes. It has also been shown to have beneficial effects on endothelial function, blood pressure, serum lipids, insulin resistance, and platelet function. In an animal model of atherosclerosis, cocoa powder, a key ingredient in chocolate, significantly inhibited atherosclerosis and improved cholesterol levels. However, it is important to note that while these studies suggest a potential preventive effect of chocolate on cardiovascular disease, further research is needed to fully understand the relationship between chocolate consumption and heart health.","previous epidemiological studies have suggested that ingestion of chocolate reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease. supported by epidemiological evidence, chocolate has emerged as a possible modulator of cardiovascular risk. accumulating evidence suggests potential preventive effects of chocolate/cocoa on the risk of cardio vascular disease (cvd). observational studies have associated reduced cardiovascular mortality with chocolate consumption. the consumption of chocolate and cocoa has established cardiovascular benefits. there is a substantial interest in the potential role of chocolate in the prevention of cardiovascular diseases. consumption of chocolate has been often hypothesized to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease (cvd) due to chocolate's high levels of stearic acid and antioxidant flavonoids. chocolate has thus been shown to have potential beneficial effects with respect to heart disease. in conclusion, chocolate intake is associated with decreased risks of chd, stroke, and diabetes. however, recent human studies have proven that chocolate has beneficial effects on some pathogenic mechanisms of heart disease such as endothelial function and blood pressure. although studies have demonstrated beneficial effects of chocolate on endothelial function, blood pressure, serum lipids, insulin resistance, and platelet function, it is unclear whether chocolate consumption influences the risk of chd. the body of short-term randomized feeding trials suggests cocoa and chocolate may exert beneficial effects on cardiovascular risk via effects on lowering blood pressure, anti-inflammation, anti-platelet function, higher hdl, decreased ldl oxidation. thus, we sought to examine whether chocolate consumption is associated with calcified atherosclerotic plaque in the coronary arteries (cac). recently, several studies have demonstrated the beneficial effects of chocolate, primarily on hypertension and other conditions such as coronary artery disease and hyperlipidemia. weekly chocolate intake may be of benefit to arterial stiffness. herein, we conducted a meta-analysis of prospective studies to determine the association between chocolate intake and risk of coronary heart disease (chd), stroke, and diabetes. the present review provides a summary of the ingredients, bioavailability and cardiovascular protective effects of chocolate / cocoa and the published effects of chocolate on a number of cardiovascular diseases. meanwhile, the large body of prospective studies of flavonoids suggests the flavonoid content of chocolate may reduce risk of cardiovascular mortality. in an animal model of atherosclerosis, cocoa powder at a human dose equivalent of two dark chocolate bars per day significantly inhibited atherosclerosis, lowered cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, and triglycerides, raised high-density lipoprotein, and protected the lower density lipoproteins from oxidation. previous studies have shown favorable effects of chocolate products on the cardiovascular system and reported an inverse relationship between chocolate consumption and adverse cardiac events; however, relationships between chocolate eating habits and heart rate variability have not yet been studied. |||",Yes
Are diets with reduced carbohydrate content better for weight loss than other weight loss programs?,No,"Justification: The evidence from randomized controlled trials suggests that low-carbohydrate diets may enable short-term weight loss by facilitating reduced energy intakes. Compared with low-fat diets, low-carbohydrate diets have been associated with significantly greater reduction in weight. Very low-carbohydrate diets containing less than 60 g carbohydrate per day appear more effective at inducing weight loss over 6 months than low-fat kilojoule-controlled diets. The probability of greater weight loss associated with low-carbohydrate diets is >99%. However, it is important to note that the long-term clinical safety and efficacy of these diets have not been studied, and poor dietary compliance may prevent long-term success.","low-carbohydrate diets may promote greater weight loss than does the conventional low-fat, high-carbohydrate diet. the low-carbohydrate diet was more effective for weight loss and cardiovascular risk factor reduction than the low-fat diet. low-carbohydrate diets are at least as effective for weight loss as other diets, but claims about increased energy expenditure and preferential loss of body fat are unsubstantiated. both low-fat and low-carbohydrate diets have been shown to induce weight loss and reduce obesity-related comorbidities. very low carbohydrate freely fed diets containing less than 60 g carbohydrate per day appear more effective at inducing weight loss over 6 months than low-fat kilojoule-controlled diets although long-term compliance to both are equally poor. after subsequent weight loss, the changes in all these variables were significantly greater and the reduction in ldl cholesterol was significantly greater with the 54%-carbohydrate diet than with the 26%-carbohydrate diet. evidence from randomized controlled trials suggests that low carbohydrate diets may enable short-term weight loss by facilitating reduced energy intakes, however poor dietary compliance may prevent long-term success. low-carbohydrate diets have been advocated as an effective method for promoting weight loss in overweight and obese individuals and preventing and treating type 2 diabetes. carbohydrate-restricted diets have been used as an alternative for weight loss. in this study, premenopausal overweight and obese women assigned to follow the atkins diet, which had the lowest carbohydrate intake, lost more weight at 12 months than women assigned to follow the zone diet, and had experienced comparable or more favorable metabolic effects than those assigned to the zone, ornish, or learn diets [corrected] while questions remain about long-term effects and mechanisms, a low-carbohydrate, high-protein, high-fat diet may be considered a feasible alternative recommendation for weight loss. low-carbohydrate diets cause greater short-term (up to 6 months) weight loss than low-fat diets, but the long-term clinical safety and efficacy of these diets has not been studied. studies with low-carbohydrate diets demonstrate a rapid weight loss, being more pronounced after 3 and 6 months compared to low-fat diets. the probability of greater weight loss associated with low carbohydrate was >99% while the reduction in predicted risk favoring low carbohydrate was >98%. summarize the physiological effects of low-carbohydrate diets as they relate to weight loss, glycemic control, and metabolic health. low carbohydrate diets, which restrict carbohydrate in favour of increased protein or fat intake, or both, are a popular weight-loss strategy. low carbohydrate diets are gaining popularity, however there is no clear consensus regarding their safety and efficacy for weight loss. very low-carbohydrate diets are widely used for weight loss yet few controlled studies have determined how these diets impact cardiovascular risk factors compared to more traditional low-fat weight loss diets. popular diets, particularly those low in carbohydrates, have challenged current recommendations advising a low-fat, high-carbohydrate diet for weight loss. compared with low fat diet, low carbohydrate was associated with significantly greater reduction in weight (δ = -2.0 kg, 95% ci: -3.1, -0.9) and significantly lower predicted risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease events (p<0.03). we evaluated whether an energy-restricted high-protein diet with a low glycemic index and soluble fiber (lc-p-lgi) would be more effective than a low-calorie conventional diet (lc-conv) on weight loss and related metabolic risk factors. |||",No
Does taking probiotics during pregnancy and early life protect children from atopic dermatitis?,No,The meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials indicates that probiotic use during pregnancy and early life decreases the incidence of atopic dermatitis in infants and young children. Maternal probiotic supplementation has been shown to prevent the development of atopic dermatitis in the offspring. The results of the meta-analysis provide evidence in support of a moderate role of probiotics in the prevention of atopic dermatitis and IgE-associated atopic dermatitis in infants. Consumption of probiotic milk in pregnancy was associated with a slightly reduced relative risk of atopic eczema at 6 months and of rhinoconjunctivitis between 18 and 36 months compared with no consumption during pregnancy. The meta-analysis demonstrated that probiotic use decreased the incidence of atopic dermatitis. Pooled analysis indicated that probiotics administered prenatally and postnatally could reduce the risk of atopy and food hypersensitivity.,"we undertook a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials to investigate whether probiotic use during pregnancy and early life decreases the incidence of atopic dermatitis and immunoglobulin e (ige)-associated atopic dermatitis in infants and young children. maternal probiotic supplementation has been shown to prevent the development of atopic dermatitis in the offspring. this meta-analysis provided evidence in support of a moderate role of probiotics in the prevention of atopic dermatitis and ige-associated atopic dermatitis in infants. we sought to assess whether consumption of probiotic milk products protects against atopic eczema, rhinoconjunctivitis, and asthma in early childhood in a large population-based pregnancy cohort (the norwegian mother and child cohort study). early treatment of new-born high-risk children with certain probiotic strains has reduced the risk of atopic eczema. we examined associations between consumption of probiotic milk products in pregnancy and infancy with questionnaire-reported atopic eczema, rhinoconjunctivitis, and asthma in 40,614 children. we investigated whether maternal probiotic supplementation during pregnancy and breast-feeding reduces the risk of developing eczema in high-risk infants. we investigated whether supplementation of probiotics prevents the development of eczema in infants at high risk. the aim of the present systematic review and meta-analysis was to evaluate the effect of probiotic supplementation during pregnancy and early infancy in preventing atopic diseases. probiotics have shown promising potential in reducing the risk of eczema in infants. the results of the present meta-analysis show that probiotic supplementation prevents infantile eczema, thus suggesting a new potential indication for probiotic use in pregnancy and infancy. the authors systematically reviewed the literature to investigate whether probiotic supplementation prenatally and/or postnatally could reduce the risk of atopy and food hypersensitivity in young children.pubmed, embase, the cochrane central register of controlled trials, and 4 main chinese literature databases (wan fang, vip, china national knowledge infrastructure, and sinomed) were searched for randomized controlled trials regarding the effect of probiotics on the prevention of allergy in children. consumption of probiotic milk in pregnancy was associated with a slightly reduced relative risk (rr) of atopic eczema at 6 months (adjusted rr, 0.94; 95% ci, 0.89-0.99) and of rhinoconjunctivitis between 18 and 36 months (adjusted rr, 0.87; 95% ci, 0.78-0.98) compared with no consumption during pregnancy. previous reports have suggested that certain probiotics given to mothers and children at risk of atopy halves the incidence of atopic dermatitis (ad) at 2 years of age. probiotics may reduce the incidence of ige-associated eczema in infancy. meta-analysis demonstrated that probiotic use decreased the incidence of atopic dermatitis (rr = 0.79 [95% ci = 0.71-0.88]). pooled analysis indicated that probiotics administered prenatally and postnatally could reduce the risk of atopy (relative risk [rr] 0.78; 95% confidence interval [ci] 0.66-0.92; i = 0%), especially when administered prenatally to pregnant mother and postnatally to child (rr 0.71; 95% ci 0.57-0.89; i = 0%), and the risk of food hypersensitivity (rr 0.77; 95% ci 0.61-0.98; i = 0%). this study evaluated the effectiveness of prenatal and postnatal probiotics in the prevention of early childhood and maternal allergic diseases. probiotics may alleviate and even prevent eczema in infants. in the last years, some studies showed a significant improvement for atopic eczema by the administration of probiotics during pregnancy and postnatally. |||",Yes
Do whole grains lower the likelihood of dying early?,Yes,"Justification: Epidemiological evidence supports the association of a diet high in whole grains with a lowered risk of chronic diseases, including coronary heart disease, obesity, type 2 diabetes, and certain types of cancer. Higher intake of whole grain has been associated with significantly decreased all-cause and cardiovascular disease-specific mortality, independent of other factors such as age, body mass index, smoking, alcohol intake, physical activity, history of diabetes, hypertension, or high cholesterol, and use of multivitamins. The inverse association between whole-grain intake and mortality suggests a potential benefit of whole-grain consumption in reducing the likelihood of dying early.","although breakfast cereals are a major source of whole and refined grains, little is known about their direct association with the risk of premature mortality. although whole-grain consumption has been associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular diseases (cvd) and mortality in the general population, the association of whole grain with mortality in diabetic patients remains to be determined. after adjustment for age, the highest versus the lowest fifths of intakes of whole grain, cereal fiber, bran, and germ were associated with 16% to 31% lower all-cause mortality. both total mortality and cvd-specific mortality were inversely associated with whole-grain but not refined-grain breakfast cereal intake. whole grains are important dietary constituents as they provide a plethora of nutrients and protective chemicals that may have synergistic actions in promoting health. we prospectively evaluated the association between whole- and refined-grain breakfast cereal intakes and total and cvd-specific mortality in a cohort of us men. whole-grain intake has been reported to be associated with a lower risk of several lifestyle-related diseases such as type 2 diabetes, cvd and some types of cancers. regular consumption of whole grain foods has been associated with a reduction in the incidence of cardiovascular disease and diabetes, reductions in cancer mortality at certain sites and an overall reduction in premature death. these findings suggest a potential benefit of whole-grain intake in reducing mortality and cardiovascular risk in diabetic patients. compared with men who rarely or never consumed whole-grain cereal, men in the highest category of whole-grain cereal intake (> or = 1 serving/d) had multivariate-estimated relative risks of total and cvd-specific mortality of 0.83 (95% ci: 0.73, 0.94; p for trend < 0.001) and 0.80 (0.66, 0.97; p for trend < 0.001), respectively. epidemiological evidence supports that a diet high in whole grains is associated with lowered risk of chronic diseases included coronary heart disease, obesity, type 2 diabetes, and some types of cancer. increasing evidence shows that grains may play a role in disease prevention beyond the simple provision of energy and nutrients. epidemiological studies have shown that consumption of whole grains and grain-based products is associated with reduced risk of chronic diseases. higher intake of whole grain was associated with significantly decreased leucocyte counts. this study investigated whole grain and its components cereal fiber, bran, and germ in relation to all-cause and cvd-specific mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. whole-grain breakfast cereal intake was inversely associated with total and cvd-specific mortality, independent of age; body mass index; smoking; alcohol intake; physical activity; history of diabetes, hypertension, or high cholesterol; and use of multivitamins. population studies have shown a positive correlation between diets rich in whole grains and a reduced risk of developing metabolic diseases, like diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and certain cancers. whole-grain and bran intakes were associated with reduced all-cause and cvd-specific mortality in women with diabetes mellitus. whole-grain (wg) intake has been associated with a lowered risk of developing type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and some cancers in epidemiological studies. whole grain consumption has been associated with reduced risk of chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases and cancer. |||",Yes
Does coffee reduce the risk of dementia?,Yes,"Numerous epidemiological studies have demonstrated that coffee consumption is associated with a lower risk of developing dementia, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). The findings suggest that higher lifetime coffee intake may contribute to lowering the risk of AD or related cognitive decline by reducing pathological cerebral amyloid deposition. Coffee and its components have several neuroprotective properties that lower the risk of cognitive decline and other neurodegenerative diseases. Recent results from prospective cohort studies have shown that moderate coffee consumption is associated with a reduced risk for diabetes mellitus type II or Alzheimer's disease. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that chronic treatment with coffee polyphenols prevented cognitive dysfunction and significantly reduced the amount of amyloid β (Aβ) plaques in the hippocampus. However, the mechanism by which coffee may provide neuroprotection in humans is not fully understood.","many epidemiological studies in this literature review have shown coffee to reduce the risk of developing dementia, stroke, and alzheimer's disease. several epidemiological and preclinical studies supported the protective effect of coffee on alzheimer's disease (ad). coffee consumption has been frequently reported for its protective association with incident dementia. the findings suggest that higher lifetime coffee intake may contribute to lowering the risk of ad or related cognitive decline by reducing pathological cerebral amyloid deposition. epidemiological studies have shown that coffee consumption may be associated with a lower risk of developing several neurological disorders, including alzheimer's disease (ad). coffee drinking is associated with many sociodemographic and health variables, but our results do not support an independent role of coffee in the pathogenesis of cognitive decline and dementia. coffee consumption is also associated with reduced risk for alzheimer's disease and non-alzheimer's dementias. numerous studies suggest that higher coffee consumption may reduce the rate of aging-related cognitive decline in women. epidemiological studies have found that habitual coffee consumption may reduce the risk of alzheimer's disease. coffee and its components have several neuroprotective properties that lower the risk of cognitive decline and other neurodegenerative diseases. studying the long-term effect of coffee consumption on dementia with stratified follow-up time may help resolve this issue. recent results from prospective cohort studies have shown that moderate coffee consumption is associated with a reduced risk for diabetes mellitus type ii or alzheimer's disease. coffee consumption has been correlated with a decreased risk of developing alzheimer's disease (ad) and parkinson's disease (pd), but the mechanism by which coffee may provide neuroprotection in humans is not fully understood. there is accumulating evidence that coffee consumption may reduce risk for type 2 diabetes, a known risk factor for alzheimer's and other neurological diseases. it has been suggested that coffee has a protective effect on cognitive performance in old age, but only some of the previous studies have shown this association. we hypothesized that compounds found in brewed coffee may elicit neuroprotective effects by inhibiting the aggregation of amyloid-beta (aβ) and tau (ad) or α-synuclein (pd). hence, this study aims to investigate relationships between coffee intake and in vivo ad pathologies, including cerebral beta-amyloid (aβ) deposition, the neurodegeneration of ad-signature regions, and cerebral white matter hyperintensities (wmh). immunohistochemical analysis revealed that chronic treatment with coffee polyphenols prevented cognitive dysfunction and significantly reduced the amount of amyloid β (aβ) plaques in the hippocampus. our data suggest that coffee consumption is not associated with incident dementia during long-term. in conclusion, our results demonstrate that coffee polyphenols prevent cognitive deficits and reduce aβ plaque deposition via disaggregation of aβ in the app/ps2 mouse. |||",Yes
Does sugar consumption increase the risk of developing type 2 diabetes regardless of obesity?,Yes,"The context suggests that sugar consumption is associated with an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes, independent of its role in obesity. This is supported by several studies that have found a positive association between sugar-sweetened soft drink intake and type 2 diabetes risk, even after adjusting for BMI. Additionally, experimental data suggest that sugars could play a role in cancer etiology through inflammatory and oxidative mechanisms and insulin resistance, even in the absence of weight gain. However, it is important to note that the included studies were observational, so their results should be interpreted cautiously.","while experimental and observational studies suggest that sugar intake is associated with the development of type 2 diabetes, independent of its role in obesity, it is unclear whether alterations in sugar intake can account for differences in diabetes prevalence among overall populations. excessive sugar intake is now recognized as a key risk factor for obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases. to investigate prospectively whether intake of total or type of sugar is associated with the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. the intake of sugar-sweetened soft drinks has been reported to be associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes, but it is unclear whether this is because of the sugar content or related lifestyle factors, whether similar associations hold for artificially sweetened soft drinks, and how these associations are related to bmi. it has been proposed that simple sugar consumption is one of the major risk factors in the development of diabetes. our objective was to examine the association between consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages, weight gain, and incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus in african american women. dietary added sugars are associated with a greater risk for t2d; however, it is unclear if added sugars influence t2d risk directly or if their effects are mediated by excess caloric intake and weight gain. regular consumption of sugar-sweetened soft drinks and fruit drinks is associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus in african american women. duration and degree of sugar exposure correlated significantly with diabetes prevalence in a dose-dependent manner, while declines in sugar exposure correlated with significant subsequent declines in diabetes rates independently of other socioeconomic, dietary and obesity prevalence changes. type 2 diabetes increases the risk of cardiovascular disease two- to fourfold compared to the risk in nondiabetic subjects. using econometric models of repeated cross-sectional data on diabetes and nutritional components of food from 175 countries, we found that every 150 kcal/person/day increase in sugar availability (about one can of soda/day) was associated with increased diabetes prevalence by 1.1% (p <0.001) after testing for potential selection biases and controlling for other food types (including fibers, meats, fruits, oils, cereals), total calories, overweight and obesity, period-effects, and several socioeconomic variables such as aging, urbanization and income. the incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus was higher with higher intake of both sugar-sweetened soft drinks and fruit drinks. the relationship between obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus is so closely related that it is worth questioning the possibility of obesity being more than just one diabetes risk factor among others but a factor which participates causally to the development of type 2 diabetes on a genetic background. increased sugar consumption may adversely affect glycemic control in patients with diabetes. background: higher sugar consumption may increase cancer risk by promoting insulin-glucose dysregulation, oxidative stress, hormonal imbalances, and excess adiposity. moderate consumption of sucrose-sweetened beverages does not further increase the prevalence of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetic subjects or in normoglycemic lean or obese men. most patients with type 2 diabetes suffer from obesity and diabetes-related complications, including cardiovascular disease and hepatic steatosis. hyperglycemia forms a direct and independent risk factor for the development of cardiovascular comorbidities in type 2 diabetes. experimental data suggest that sugars could play a role in cancer etiology through obesity but also through inflammatory and oxidative mechanisms and insulin resistance, even in the absence of weight gain. the included studies were observational, so their results should be interpreted cautiously, but findings indicate a positive association between sugar-sweetened soft drink intake and type 2 diabetes risk, attenuated by adjustment for bmi. |||",Yes
Does a lower salt diet reduce the likelihood of cardiovascular disease?,Yes,"The evidence suggests that a lower salt diet can reduce the likelihood of cardiovascular disease. A reduction in dietary sodium not only decreases blood pressure and the incidence of hypertension but is also associated with a reduction in morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular diseases. A modest reduction in salt intake causes significant falls in blood pressure in all ethnic groups. Salt reduction may also reduce other cardiovascular risk factors, such as urinary albumin excretion and arterial stiffness. The incidence rate of cardiovascular disease was reduced for those who reduced their sodium intake. In chronic kidney disease patients, a low salt diet is warranted, as it is an established intervention in the treatment of impaired renal function and hypertension, which may modulate cardiovascular risk independent of recognized antihypertensive effects. Prolonged modest reduction in salt intake induces a relevant fall in blood pressure in both hypertensive and normotensive individuals, irrespective of sex and ethnic group, with larger falls in systolic blood pressure for larger reductions in dietary salt.","in the light of the proposal that dietary salt intake should be reduced as a community health care measure designed to lower blood pressure and consequently mortality and morbidity from stroke and heart disease, the evidence that there is a link between salt intake and blood pressure is reviewed. current epidemiology indicates that lower-salt diets tend to reduce coronary risk quite markedly in obese subjects, whereas the impact of such diets on leaner subjects (who are less likely to be salt sensitive) is equivocal--seemingly consistent with the possibility that salt restriction can exert countervailing effects on vascular health. a reduction in salt intake lowers blood pressure. we conducted a prospective cohort study to investigate whether an intensive low-salt diet education program effectively attenuated the rate of renal function decline in hypertensive patients with ckd. dietary salt restriction lowers blood pressure and has been advocated as a population-based strategy to reduce the cardiovascular morbidity associated with hypertension. this cohort study demonstrated that an intensive low-salt diet education program attenuated the rate of renal function decline in hypertensive ckd patients independent of its effect on lowering salt intake or albuminuria during the 36 months of follow-up. low-salt diets have potential for prevention and treatment of hypertension, and may also reduce risk for stroke, left ventricular hypertrophy, osteoporosis, renal stones, asthma, cataract, gastric pathology, and possibly even senile dementia. a reduction in dietary sodium not only decreases the blood pressure and the incidence of hypertension, but is also associated with a reduction in morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular diseases. these results demonstrate that a modest reduction in salt intake, approximately the amount of the current public health recommendations, causes significant falls in blood pressure in all 3 ethnic groups. one of the controversies in preventive medicine is, whether a general reduction in sodium intake can decrease the blood pressure of a population and thereby reduce cardiovascular mortality and morbidity. one of the controversies in preventive medicine is, whether a general reduction in sodium intake can decrease the blood pressure of a population and thereby reduce cardiovascular mortality and morbidity. with this reduction in salt intake, there was a significant decrease in blood pressure from 146+/-13/91+/-8 to 141+/-12/88+/-9 mm hg (p<0.001), urinary albumin from 10.2 (iqr: 6.8 to 18.9) to 9.1 (6.6 to 14.0) mg/24 hours (p<0.001), albumin/creatinine ratio from 0.81 (0.47 to 1.43) to 0.66 (0.44 to 1.22) mg/mmol (p<0.001), and carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity from 11.5+/-2.3 to 11.1+/-1.9 m/s (p<0.01). salt reduction may also reduce other cardiovascular risk factors (eg, urinary albumin excretion, arterial stiffness). the incidence rate of cvd was reduced for those who reduced their sodium intake and were randomly assigned to meddiet interventions [4.1/10,000 (95% ci: 3.1, 8.0) compared with 4.4/10,000 (95% ci: 2.7, 12.4) person-years; p = 0.002]. in chronic kidney disease (ckd) patients, observational and recent interventional studies investigating the relationship between sodium intake and renal outcomes suggest that low salt diet is warranted in this high risk category of patients. a low sodium diet is an established intervention in the treatment of impaired renal function and hypertension which may modulate cardiovascular risk independent of recognised antihypertensive effects. prolonged modest reduction in salt intake induces a relevant fall in blood pressure in both hypertensive and normotensive individuals, irrespective of sex and ethnic group, with larger falls in systolic blood pressure for larger reductions in dietary salt. further clinical studies should determine whether a moderately salt-restricted diet supplemented with organic sodium salts has a better and more uniform impact on hypertension than salt restriction alone, while rodent studies should examine the comparative impact of these regimens on rodents prone to vascular disease. we conclude that short-term, moderate dietary salt restriction does not adversely affect insulin sensitivity or levels of atherogenic lipids in normotensive nonobese men. however, the effect of lowering salt intake on metabolic vascular risk factors such as insulin resistance and levels of atherogenic lipids and fasting insulin is uncertain. |||",Yes
Is less eaten from red plates?,Yes,"The study indicates that the average total energy intake was significantly lower when food was served on red plates (1102.16 ± 47.12 kcal) compared to black plates (1113.19 ± 47.12 kcal) and white plates (945.72 ± 47.12 kcal). This suggests that plate color, specifically red, may have an effect on reducing food consumption. However, the underlying mechanism for this effect remains unclear. The results also showed that plate color had a significant effect on food intake during the test days (p = 0.021). The study also revealed that the effect of red plates on food consumption was not due to a decrease in the consciously experienced appeal of products on red plates, as overall appreciation of the foods did not differ according to plate color.","recent literature suggests that individuals may consume less food when this is served on red plates. the average total energy intake with red (1102.16 ± 47.12 kcal, p = 0.05) and black plates (1113.19 ± 47.12 kcal, p = 0.034) was significantly increased when compared to that with white plates (945.72 ± 47.12 kcal). plate colour may be a crucial determinant of energy intake. results confirmed that red plates reduce taste-related consumption and extended this effect to the touch-related consumption of moisturizing cream. plate colour was previously shown to alter the amount of food consumption due to its environmental effect on food intake. in light of this finding, the main objective of this study was to determine whether food consumption during an open buffet meal was different when using same-sized white, red or black plates. the results showed that plate colour exerted a significant effect on food intake during the test days (p = 0.021). does the size of a plate influence the serving of all items equally, or does it influence the serving of some foods - such as meat versus vegetables - differently? this study revealed some potential moderators for the plate-size-effect, such as the type of dish, and its associated appeal and familiarity, and provided useful indications about the effectiveness of small plates for food reduction. suggesting that the effect was not due to a decrease in the consciously experienced appeal of products on red plates, overall appreciation of the foods or cream did not differ according to plate color. although the origin of the intriguing effect of the color red on consumption remains unclear, our results may prove useful to future potential explanations. therefore, the aim of this study was to examine whether or not three different sizes of plates influence energy intake during a multi-itemed buffet meal in normal weight women. the total drawn meal area was 37% bigger on large plates than small plates, which showed that the portion of plate coverage did not differ by plate size. smaller plates are often recommended as a strategy for controlling energy intake; however, the effect of plate size on meal energy intake in normal weight compared to overweight or obese individuals is not known. food appears larger if plated on smaller dishes than larger dishes and liquid volumes appear larger in taller cups than shorter cups. to examine this question, we used the new method of plate mapping, where people drew a meal on a paper plate to examine sensitivity to small versus large three-compartment divided plates in portion size and meal composition in a sample of 109 university students. implications for decreasing portion size and improving meal balance are that plate size may influence portion size and change the proportions of foods served. the study assessed the effect of plate size amongst normal-weight (n = 124) and overweight (n = 79) new zealand europeans. research has shown that 1) the slower a food is eaten the less food is consumed overall, and 2) context affects portion selection. research has shown that people consume more food when offered larger portions, and that reducing exposure to large food portions and packages could decrease the average daily energy consumed. |||",Yes
Do azo food dyes cause attention deficit disorder and hyperactivity in children?,Yes,"The available evidence supports the hypothesis that azo food dyes, a type of artificial food coloring, can contribute to behavioral changes in children, including hyperactivity. A meta-analysis of 15 double-blind clinical trials showed an increase in hyperactive behavior in children already considered to be hyperactive when exposed to artificial food colorings. Additionally, a placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover clinical study in 297 children representative of the general population showed higher hyperactivity scores during the periods when they were ingesting food colorings. Although the mechanism underlying this phenomenon has not been fully elucidated, it is best to avoid exposing children to artificial food coloring.","the consumption of artificial food dye (afd) during childhood and adolescence has been linked to behavioural changes, such as hyperactivity. artificial food colorants have been suggested to affect children's behavior, being hyperactivity the most common disorder. we seek to assess whether artificial food colorings (afcs) contribute to the behavioral symptomatology of hyperactive syndromes. this review examines the research on mechanisms by which artificial food colors (afcs) and common foods may cause behavioral changes in children with and without attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (adhd). (1) a hypothesis has been proposed that artificial food colourings have a role in exacerbating hyperactive behavior in children; (2) a placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover clinical study in 297 children representative of the general population showed higher hyperactivity scores during the periods when they were ingesting food colourings; (3) a meta-analysis of 15 double-blind clinical trials that evaluated artificial food colouring in children already considered to be hyperactive showed an increase in their hyperactive behavior; (4) in practice, even though the mechanism underlying this phenomenon has not be elucidated, these data suggest that it is best to avoid exposing children to artificial food coloring. consumption of fd&c dyes has been associated with neurobehavioral behavior in some children. the proposition that synthetic food colors can induce adverse behavioral effects in children was first enunciated in 1975 by feingold [why your child is hyperactive. artificial food colourings and additives (afcas) have long been discussed to have adverse effects on cognition and behaviour in children. the question of the possible role of food additives, and specifically food colours, in elevating hyperactive behaviour in children has been long debated. in this study, our aim was to assess the probable side effects of prenatal exposure to colouring food additives on neurobehaviour and spatial learning process. it has been proposed that developmental exposure to pesticides contributes to increasing prevalence of neurodevelopmental disorders in children, such as attention deficit with hyperactivity (adhd) and to alterations in coordination skills. due to the high amount of artificial food colorants present in infants' diets, their adverse effects have been of major concern among the literature. new york:random house (1975)], who asserted that elevated sensitivity to food additives underlies the signs of hyperactivity observed in some children. the available evidence supports the hypothesis that pesticide exposure at levels that do not cause acute toxicity may be among the multifactorial causes of adhd and asd, though further study is needed, especially for some of the newer pesticides. food additives and hyperactive behaviour in 3-year-old and 8/9-year-old children in the community: a randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial. this review describes the basic laboratory science including controlled pesticide dosing experiments in animals that supports a mechanistic relationship in the development of adhd and/or asd. developmental neurotoxicity of industrial chemicals and pharmaceuticals have been of growing interest in recent years due to the increasing reports of neuropsychiatric disorders, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (adhd) and autism. epidemiological relationships are also described for low-level pesticide exposure and adhd and/or asd. several food contaminants are suspected of being a possible contributing factor to the present-day increase in diseases, such as obesity and adhd, and pesticides are also considered as a contributor to the increased prevalence of adhd. there is now replicated evidence that the removal of food colours from the diet can make a small improvement in the behaviour of some children with adhd. |||",Yes
Does breastfeeding reduce the risk of sudden infant death syndrome?,Yes,"Justification: The context indicates that breastfeeding is thought to be protective against sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Epidemiological studies have shown that breast-fed infants are at a decreased risk of SIDS compared to formula-fed infants. Both partial and exclusive breastfeeding have been associated with a reduced risk of SIDS. Exclusive breastfeeding at 1 month of age halved the risk, while partial breastfeeding also reduced the risk, although the latter was not significant after adjustment. The protective effect of breastfeeding against SIDS is stronger when breastfeeding is exclusive. However, the duration of breastfeeding required to confer a protective effect is unknown.","this study shows that breastfeeding reduced the risk of sudden infant death syndrome by approximately 50% at all ages throughout infancy. because breastfeeding is thought to be protective against sudden infant death syndrome (sids), environmental or child care factors that promote breastfeeding might reduce infant vulnerability to sids. breastfeeding survival curves showed that both partial breastfeeding and exclusive breastfeeding were associated with a reduced risk of sudden infant death syndrome. exclusive breastfeeding at 1 month of age halved the risk, partial breastfeeding at the age of 1 month also reduced the risk of sudden infant death syndrome, but after adjustment this risk was not significant. epidemiological studies indicate that breast-fed infants are at a decreased risk of sudden infant death syndrome (sids) compared to formula-fed infants. breastfeeding is associated with a reduction in risk for postneonatal death. however, it is unclear whether breastfeeding specifically lowers sudden infant death syndrome (sids) risk, because study results have been conflicting. epidemiological studies have shown that breast feeding reduces an infant's risk of sids. breastfeeding benefits both infant and mother, including reducing the risk of sudden infant death syndrome (sids). to examine the association between type of infant feeding and sudden infant death syndrome. our findings suggest that early initiation of breastfeeding reduces neonatal and early infant mortality both through increasing rates of exclusive breastfeeding and by additional mechanisms. breast feeding is known to protect an infant against gastrointestinal pathogens and epidemiological studies indicate that compared to breast fed infants, formula fed infants are at a greater risk of dying from sudden infant death syndrome (sids). our previous meta-analyses showed that any breastfeeding is protective against sids with exclusive breastfeeding conferring a stronger effect.the duration of breastfeeding required to confer a protective effect is unknown. this study aims to identify the risky behaviors of mothers with infants that may put their children at risk for sudden infant death syndrome. sudden infant death syndrome (sids) is a leading cause of postneonatal infant mortality. assuming causality, however, promoting breastfeeding has the potential to save or delay approximately 720 postneonatal deaths in the united states each year. factors such as sleeping position, bed sharing, pillow use, smoking during pregnancy and the breastfeeding period constitute risk factors for sudden infant death syndrome. breastfeeding is protective against sids, and this effect is stronger when breastfeeding is exclusive. benefits of breastfeeding include lower risk of postneonatal mortality. to assess the associations between breastfeeding duration and sids. |||",Yes
Is it harmful for the mental development of the unborn child if the mother regularly eats fish contaminated with mercury during pregnancy?,Yes,"Justification: The study indicates that higher fish consumption in pregnancy is associated with better infant cognition. However, higher mercury levels are associated with lower cognition. Maternal fish consumption exposes the mother to methylmercury, which can be harmful to fetal growth. While the relationship between intrauterine exposure to mercury and offspring IQ appears to be benign if the mother consumes fish, high levels of mercury exposure can result in damage to the brain of the developing fetus. The study found no evidence to suggest that prenatal levels of maternal blood mercury were associated with adverse development of the child, even when the mother had consumed no fish during pregnancy. However, the fact that certain fish species have high levels of methyl-mercury, leading to consumer advisory guidelines, suggests that regular consumption of fish contaminated with mercury during pregnancy can be harmful for the mental development of the unborn child.","this study aimed to evaluate whether cord blood total mercury levels may have a negative effect on both mental and psychomotor development in a maternal-birth cohort from moderate-high fish consumption areas. higher fish consumption in pregnancy was associated with better infant cognition, but higher mercury levels were associated with lower cognition. consequently, fish consumption by pregnant women, children, and women of childbearing age is of concern because of the effects of mercury exposure on human health. conflicting evidence concerning possible harm from mercury (hg) in regard to offspring cognition if the woman eats fish has prompted this study to examine evidence from a british pre-birth cohort to investigate the relationship between the two. the relationship between intrauterine exposure to mercury and offspring iq appears to be benign provided the mother consumes fish. we examined associations of maternal fish intake during pregnancy and maternal hair mercury at delivery with infant cognition among 135 mother-infant pairs in project viva, a prospective u.s. pregnancy and child cohort study. there is evidence that high levels of mercury exposure to the pregnant woman can result in damage to the brain of the developing fetus. self-reported weekly amount of fish consumption during the first two trimesters of pregnancy correlated positively with umbilical cord mercury concentrations (r(s)=0.22, p<0.0001). findings of developmental neurotoxicity following high-level prenatal exposure to mehg raised the question of whether children whose mothers consumed fish contaminated with background levels during pregnancy are at an increased risk of impaired neurological function. we found no evidence to suggest that prenatal levels of maternal blood mercury were associated with adverse development of the child, even when the mother had consumed no fish during pregnancy. although the maternal fish consumption is supposed to have beneficial effects on development of infants, it may be harmful for child cognitive development since fish is a common source of methylmercury. we endeavored to study whether maternal fish consumption during pregnancy harms or benefits fetal brain development. because exposure to methylmercury is primarily through fish, concern has been expressed that the consumption of fish by pregnant women could adversely affect their fetuses. maternal fish consumption exposes the mother to the neurotoxicant methylmercury (mehg), which, in contrast, may restrict fetal growth. the seychelles child development study was designed to test the hypothesis that prenatal exposure to mehg from maternal consumption of a diet high in fish is detrimental to child neurodevelopment. purpose of the study was to describe the usual pattern of fish consumption during pregnancy in poland and explain the variability of prenatal mercury exposure due to fish intake by mothers. maternal fish consumption during pregnancy exposes the fetus simultaneously to methylmercury (mehg) and long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (lcpufa). the most common form of prenatal exposure is maternal fish consumption, but whether such exposure harms the fetus is unknown. neurotoxicity due to acute prenatal exposure to high-dose of mercury (hg) is well documented. certain fish species have high levels of methyl-mercury leading to consumer's advisory guidelines in regard of fish consumption to protect infants from mercury exposure passing through breast milk. |||",Yes
Are vegetables prepared in a microwave oven less healthy than those prepared in other ways?,No,"The healthiness of vegetables prepared in a microwave oven compared to other methods is not definitively established due to the controversial results in the literature. The microwave cooking process can present varying outcomes depending on the conditions employed, such as time, power, and added water. In general, longer microwave cooking times and higher volumes of cooking water should be avoided to minimize nutrient losses. However, non-uniform heating is a concern in microwave cooking, which may impact the retention of vitamins and phytochemicals. Steaming, including microwave steaming, is generally preferred over boiling for certain vegetables, as it retains nutrients better. Consuming raw vegetables offers essential nutrients that may not be present in cooked vegetables. The impact of cooking methods on food nutrients is significant, and the sources and washing techniques used for vegetables can influence health risks. Therefore, it is not possible to definitively state that vegetables prepared in a microwave oven are less healthy than those prepared in other ways.","therefore, the aim of this work was to study the influence of these conditions during microwave cooking on the human bioactive compounds of broccoli. generally, steaming and microwave steaming were preferred for certain vegetables, even by those who normally boil them. for all features, steaming and microwave steaming were rated significantly higher than boiling for broccoli (for acceptability 6.2 and 7.1 versus 5.1; p < 0.001), whereas carrots were similarly considered better for flavour and overall acceptability. generally, boiling of vegetables is assumed leading to lower nutritional values because of leaching effects and activity loss of bioactive compounds. carrots, broccoli and green cabbage were boiled, steamed or microwave steamed. the microwave cooking process presents controversial results in the literature due to the different conditions that are employed (time, power, and added water). in general, the longest microwave cooking time and the higher volume of cooking water should be avoided to minimize losses of nutrients. due to the inherent nature of standing wave patterns of microwaves inside a domestic microwave oven cavity and varying dielectric properties of different food components, microwave heating produces non-uniform distribution of energy inside the food. steaming retains vitamins and phytochemicals in vegetables better than boiling; thus, it is important to promote this cooking method. consuming raw vegetables offers essential nutrients that one may not get when such vegetables are usually cooked. cooking as a domestic processing method has a great impact on food nutrients. vegetables in the diet contribute to disease prevention. such risks may be influenced by the sources of the vegetables and washing techniques used. the sun-dried vegetables had inferior colour, texture and acceptibility compared to the vegetables dried in the cabinet dryer. non-uniform heating is a major food safety concern in not-ready-to-eat (nrte) microwaveable foods. most brassica (brassicaceae, cruciferae) vegetables are mainly consumed after being cooked, and cooking considerably affects their health-promoting compounds (specifically, glucosinolates, phenolic compunds, minerals, and vitamin c studied here). the study suggested that the best location to place food in a microwave oven is not at the center but near the edge of the turntable assuming uniform heating is desired. as brassica vegetables are mainly consumed cooked, the influence of boiling on kale's flavonoids and their antioxidant activity was investigated. insufficient intake of total fruits and vegetables is linked to an increased cancer risk, but the relation is not understood for dried fruits. consumption of ready-to-eat (rte) vegetables is quick, easy and healthy, especially when eaten without cooking. |||",No
Can green tea affect the likelihood of dying early and reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease?,Yes,"The consumption of green tea has been associated with a decrease in cardiovascular mortality, as evidenced by epidemiological studies. The health benefits of green tea are attributed to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, which may reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases such as coronary heart disease (CHD) and lower plasma levels of cholesterol and triglyceride. Green tea contains polyphenolic catechins, which act as antioxidants and decrease the risk for cardiovascular diseases. Furthermore, green tea consumption has been inversely associated with the development and progression of cardiovascular diseases and risk factors. Therefore, green tea may prove beneficial as a dietary element in lifestyle interventions aiming to lower cardiovascular disease risk in both older and younger populations.","consumption of green tea is associated with a decrease in cardiovascular mortality. green tea represents a promising tool for the prevention of cardiovascular disorders. epidemiological studies suggest that green tea consumption is associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease. this study was designed to determine whether the consumption of green tea is proportionately associated with a decreased incidence of coronary artery disease (cad) and the cardiovascular and cerebrovascular prognosis. green tea consumption has been associated with a reduction in cardiovascular disease risk factors. our results suggest that green tea may prove beneficial as a dietary element in lifestyle interventions aiming to lower cardiovascular disease risk, in both older and younger populations. green tea consumption has been inversely associated with cardiovascular disease (cvd) in epidemiological studies. consumption of green tea has been inversely associated with the development and progression of cardiovascular diseases and cardiovascular risk factors. the health benefit of green tea has been attributed to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties; however, considerable evidence suggests that green tea and its catechins may reduce the risk of chd by lowering the plasma levels of cholesterol and triglyceride. animal and epidemiological studies suggest that green tea catechins may reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases [e.g., coronary heart disease (chd)]. green tea contains polyphenolic catechins which can act as antioxidants and thus decrease the risk for cardiovascular diseases. previous studies have reported that green tea consumption is associated with a lower risk of diseases that cause functional disability, such as stroke, cognitive impairment, and osteoporosis. epidemiological evidence shows that green tea may be a factor in lowering cancer risk. human and animal studies have shown that green tea consumption is associated with a reduced risk of some cancers. this study suggests that the consumption of green tea ≥2 times/d is associated with a reduced risk of copd in korean populations. the frequent consumption of green tea has been shown to have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects and to reduce the risk of lung cancer and type 2 diabetes. although some interventional trials suggest that green tea has beneficial effects on cvd risk factors, such as hypertension and obesity, others have failed to show such benefits. we conclude that an amount of green tea extract which corresponds to 10 cups of tea per day for 4 weeks does not have specific effects on several indicators related to risk of cardiovascular diseases in comparison with placebo treatment. the consumption of green tea is associated with a lower risk of several types of human carcinomas. the beneficial health effects of green tea are attributed in part to polyphenols, organic compounds found in tea that lower blood pressure, reduce body fat, decrease ldl cholesterol, and inhibit inflammation. |||",Yes
Can acupuncture prevent migraines and tension headaches?,Yes,"The evidence from multiple clinical trials and systematic reviews, including a Cochrane review, supports the use of acupuncture as an effective prophylactic measure for patients with frequent or insufficiently controlled migraine attacks. Acupuncture has been shown to significantly decrease both the frequency and intensity of migraines, with the benefits persisting for at least 12 weeks after the final acupuncture session. The specific mechanisms of acupuncture are not yet fully understood, but research suggests that it may involve the inhibition of dural mast cells, macrophages, and serum inflammatory factors. Although the effectiveness of acupuncture for episodic migraine has been confirmed, the mechanisms underlying its specific effect on migraine remain controversial. Acupuncture may also be a suitable choice for menstrual-related migraine when pharmacological prophylaxis is not suitable.","we postulate that acupuncture at the active acupoint might have the potential effect of regulating some disease-affected key regions and the pain circuitry for migraine, and promote establishing psychophysical pain homeostasis. multiple studies support acupuncture as a validated modality for the prevention of episodic migraine. acupuncture has been commonly used for preventing migraine attacks and relieving pain during a migraine, although there is limited knowledge on the physiological mechanism behind this method. recently, a cochrane review on its use in migraine concluded that acupuncture is effective and should be considered as a prophylactic measure for patients with frequent or insufficiently controlled migraine attacks. acupuncture significantly influenced migraine frequency and intensity in the study's participants when preintervention measurements were compared to postintervention measurements. these results indicate that not only did acupuncture decrease both the frequency and intensity of migraines, but also the benefit had not subsided for 12 wks after the final acupuncture session. acupuncture has a therapeutic effect similar to that of prophylactic drugs and can be considered a treatment option for migraineurs. acupuncture is becoming a more widely used therapy for the prevention and treatment of migraine, but its effectiveness is still in question when compared to the pharmacological treatments even though very few of these have class a and b evidence for migraine prevention. we aim to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of acupuncture for both episodic migraine and chronic migraine by meta-analysis and explore the possible factors influencing the specific effect of acupuncture for migraine by meta-regression. acupuncture is commonly used to treat migraine and has gained popularity as a validated non-pharmaceutical option. this is a systematic review of data from existing randomized trials that compare the effectiveness of acupuncture treatment with conventional migraine preventative medications. although the specific mechanisms of acupuncture are not clearly understood, there is evidence for its effectiveness in treating migraine. the purpose of the current study was to evaluate whether a standardized set of acupuncture points, when used to deliver treatment over a predefined period of time, could reduce the frequency and intensity of migraines. the purpose of this review is to discuss the current evidence for acupuncture in migraine and to provide insight into which patients may benefit most from acupuncture. research has shown that acupuncture may be an effective and safe adjuvant or alternative migraine treatment. inhibition of dural mast cells, macrophages, and serum inflammatory factors may be one of the mechanisms involved in acupuncture treatment's effect on migraine. although the effectiveness of acupuncture for episodic migraine has been confirmed by multiple clinical trials and cochrane systematic reviews, the mechanisms underlying the specific effect of acupuncture for migraine remain controversial. we included randomized trials and randomized controlled trials in adult patients that compared the clinical effects of acupuncture with a standard migraine preventive medication in patients with a diagnosis of chronic or episodic migraine with or without aura. acupuncture may be a choice for menstrual-related migraine, when pharmacological prophylaxis is not suitable. a total of eighty migraineurs without aura were enrolled to receive either active acupoint acupuncture or inactive acupoint acupuncture treatment for 8 weeks, and twenty patients in each group were randomly selected for the fmri scan at the end of baseline and at the end of treatment. |||",Yes
Can green tea reduce the likelihood of dying from cancer ?,No,"The context suggests that green tea consumption is associated with a reduced risk of certain types of cancers and a lower risk of several types of human carcinomas. However, it does not provide direct evidence or information on whether green tea can reduce the likelihood of dying from cancer. The context primarily focuses on the potential cancer-preventive effects of green tea, such as scavenging oxidative radicals, inhibition of tumor initiation, and modulation of detoxification enzymes. While these mechanisms may contribute to a reduced risk of cancer, the context does not establish a clear link between green tea consumption and a decreased likelihood of dying from cancer. Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to definitively answer the question.","drinking green tea is associated with decreased frequency of cancer development. epidemiological evidence shows that green tea may be a factor in lowering cancer risk. green tea consumption has been associated with decreased risk of certain types of cancers in humans. investigators have shown that green tea may decrease the risk of cancer. human and animal studies have shown that green tea consumption is associated with a reduced risk of some cancers. green tea consumption has been linked to a reduced occurrence of some tumor types. epidemiological studies have associated the consumption of green tea with a lower risk of several types of cancers, including stomach, oral cavity, esophagus, and lung. the consumption of green tea is associated with a lower risk of several types of human carcinomas. daily green tea consumption was associated with a non-significant reduction in lung cancer risk. experimental evidence suggests that green tea (camellia sinesis) may reduce the risk of lung cancer through several hypothesized mechanisms including scavenging oxidative radicals, inhibition of tumor initiation, and modulation of detoxification enzymes. based on recent evidence that tea consumption contributes to a decreased incidence of human carcinomas, a number of investigators have focused on the mechanisms of cancer prevention by tea extracts, especially green tea polyphenols. a number of epidemiological studies suggest that the consumption of green tea reduces the incidence of prostate cancer. a number of epidemiological studies have suggested that consumption of green tea reduces the risk of prostate cancer. recently, an epidemiological study showed a lower risk of gastric cancer among people who consume a large amount of green tea. induction of detoxification enzymes has been suggested as one of the biochemical mechanisms responsible for the cancer-preventive effect of green tea. as the major catechins present in green tea are potent antioxidants, we hypothesized that genetic and cellular damage induced by oxygen free radicals could be significantly reduced by potent antioxidants in green tea, thus reducing the cumulative genetic and cellular damage with age, and slowing or preventing tumour formation. there is epidemiological evidence showing that drinking green tea can lower the risk of esophageal cancer (ec). thus, green tea had significant chemopreventive effects on carcinogen-induced mammary tumorigenesis in female s-d rats. since cancer is angiogenesis dependent, this may partially explain the antineoplastic effects associated with green tea consumption. an epidemiological study showed that green tea consumption is associated with a reduced risk of hematopoietic malignancy. |||",No
Can too much iodine cause autoimmune thyroid disease and consequently hypothyroidism?,Yes,"Excessive iodine intake has been shown to induce hypothyroidism in patients with underlying thyroid disorders, including autoimmune thyroiditis such as Hashimoto's thyroiditis. This is supported by epidemiological studies that have observed an increase in the prevalence of overt and subclinical hypothyroidism, as well as autoimmune thyroiditis, with increasing iodine intake. The mechanisms involved are not fully understood, but it is thought that iodine excess may interact with the immune system and trigger the development of autoimmune thyroid disease. Additionally, high doses of ingested iodine have been observed to predict and increase the incidence of the thyroiditis process. These findings suggest that excessive iodine intake may lead to thyroid dysfunction through both biochemical and immunological mechanisms, particularly in patients with autoimmune thyroid disorders.","more than adequate or excessive iodine intake may lead to hypothyroidism and autoimmune thyroiditis. iodine may induce hypothyroidism in patients with autoimmune thyroiditis in a dose-dependent manner. by interacting with the immune system, iodine excess may trigger the development of autoimmune thyroid disease such as lymphocytic hashimoto's thyroiditis (lt). prolonged intake of large amounts of iodine has been reported to increase the incidence of hypothyroidism in humans, as well as in animals which are prone to spontaneously developing autoimmune thyroiditis. our previous epidemiological study indicated that excessive intake of iodine could potentially lead to hypothyroidism. epidemiologic researches have shown that exposure to iodine may be involved in the onset and development of autoimmune thyroiditis. excessive iodine intake is known to induce hypothyroidism in people who have underlying thyroid disorders. however, previous reports have shown that excess iodine induces hypothyroidism in hashimoto's thyroiditis. iodine deficiency has been reported to facilitate the development of toxic nodular goitre, whereas a high iodine intake may increase the prevalence of autoimmune hypothyroidism. chronic iodine deficiency leads to hypothyroidism, but iodine excess also impairs thyroid function causing hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, and/or thyroiditis. high doses of ingested iodine were observed to precdict and increase the incidence of the thyroiditis process. these findings may provide a potential mechanism of iodine excess-induced overt and subclinical hypothyroidism. increased iodide intake has been linked to the development of hypothyroidism and/or autoimmune thyroiditis in humans and animals, but the mechanisms involved remain poorly understood. we observed an increase in the prevalence of overt hypothyroidism, subclinical hypothyroidism, and autoimmune thyroiditis with increasing iodine intake in china in cohorts from three regions with different levels of iodine intake: mildly deficient (median urinary iodine excretion, 84 microg per liter), more than adequate (median, 243 microg per liter), and excessive (median, 651 microg per liter). high nutritional levels of iodine may induce a higher prevalence of autoimmune thyroiditis, hypothyroidism, goiter, as well as hyperthyroidism, mostly in the elderly. iodine is an essential component of thyroid hormones; high intake may lead to thyroid disease. these in vitro findings suggest that iodide at high concentrations may induce thyroid dysfunction through not only biochemical but also immunological mechanisms, particularly in patients with autoimmune thyroid disorders. consumption of foods deficient in iodine induces hypothyroidism. high iodine is a well-known factor that can induce thyroid disorders, including hashimoto's thyroiditis, one of the main types of aitd. excessive iodine intake causes iodine induced hyperthyroidism (iih). |||",Yes
Is the sweetener aspartame harmful to health?,No,"The safety of aspartame, an artificial sweetener, remains a topic of debate.

The present scientific data on the potential toxicity of aspartame and its link with the risk of carcinogenesis, specifically colorectal cancer, are inconclusive. Therefore, it is not possible to definitively state whether aspartame is harmful to health based on the available information.","aspartame (asp), an artificial sweetener abundantly consumed in recent years in an array of dietary products, has raised some concerns in terms of toxicity, and it was even suggested a link with the risk of carcinogenesis (colorectal cancer), though the present scientific data are rather inconclusive. the use of the artificial sweetener, aspartame, has long been contemplated and studied by various researchers, and people are concerned about its negative effects. aspartame (α-aspartyl-l-phenylalanine-o-methyl ester), an artificial sweetener, has been linked to behavioral and cognitive problems. the non-caloric sweetener aspartame can be potentially harmful to the developing brain, as some studies suggest an association between aspartame intake and adverse neural effects. aspartame, an artificial sweetener, is very widely used in many foods and beverages. aspartame (asp) is one of the commonest artificial sweetener used all over the world and considered as an extremely risky compound and raises a lot of controversy. this report examines the safety issues related to the nutritive sweetener aspartame, including possible toxic effects of aspartame's component amino acids, aspartic acid and phenylalanine, and its major decomposition products, methanol and diketopiperazine, and the potential synergistic effect of aspartame and dietary carbohydrate on brain neurochemicals. aspartame is an artificial sweetener usually consumed by hundreds of millions of persons all over the world. aspartame is an artificial sweetner added to many low-calorie foods. aspartame is one of the most common consumed artificial sweeteners utilized in many food products and beverages. aspartame is one of the most widely used artificial sweeteners globally. previously, it has been reported that consumption of aspartame could cause neurological and behavioural disturbances in sensitive individuals. the study reports that consumption of aspartame containing product could lead to cancer. aspartame (n-l-α-aspartyl-l-phenylalanine-1-methyl ester) (asp) is a synthetic sweetener used in foods and its safety remains controversial. aspartame is one of the most commonly consumed artificial sweeteners that is widely used in foodstuffs. aspartame is an artificial sweetener used as an alternate for sugar in several foods and beverages. we reviewed studies linking neurophysiological symptoms to aspartame usage and conclude that aspartame may be responsible for adverse neurobehavioral health outcomes. available evidence suggests that consumption of aspartame by normal humans is safe and is not associated with serious adverse health effects. aspartame (nutrasweet®, equal®) is a widely used artificial sweetener, has been reported to be accountable for neurological and behavioural disturbances in people. purpose of this review was to spread the awareness about adverse effect of aspartame intake to outline the occurrence of health issues among the population. |||",No
Does coffee affect cancer death risk?,No,"Justification: The context suggests that coffee consumption is associated with decreased risk of mortality from all-cause, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. However, it is noted that smoking modifies the observed risk when studying the role of coffee on human health.

However, it is important to note that coffee is a rich source of bioactive compounds that have potential anticarcinogenic effects, and has been hypothesized to have protective effects in colorectal neoplasia. Therefore, it can be concluded that coffee consumption may affect cancer death risk, but further research is needed to fully understand the relationship.","here we evaluated whether coffee intake is associated with: (i) overall risk of being diagnosed with/dying from any cancer; and (ii) risk of individual cancers. these findings suggest that coffee consumption might impact the prevention of crc, especially distal colon cancer. in conclusion, coffee consumption is associated with decreased risk of mortality from all-cause, cvd, and cancer; however, smoking modifies the observed risk when studying the role of coffee on human health. the results suggested that a significant association was found between coffee consumption and decreased risk of colorectal and colon cancer among subjects consuming ≥4 cups of coffee per day. the relation between recent coffee consumption and the risk of breast cancer was evaluated in a case-control study, based on interviews conducted 1975-1982 at several mainly eastern us teaching and community hospitals. epidemiological studies suggest that coffee consumption reduces the risk of cancers, including colon cancer, but the molecular mechanisms and target(s) underlying the chemopreventive effects of coffee and its active ingredient(s) remain unknown. consumption of coffee, a popular beverage worldwide, has been associated with lower colorectal cancer (crc) risk. we examined the relationship between intake of coffee and hormone-related cancer risk among japanese women using data from the hospital-based epidemiological research program at aichi cancer center (herpacc). coffee drinking may be associated with lower risk of colon cancer in japanese women. previous observational studies have suggested that coffee intake may be associated with a reduction in cancer risk. evidence regarding the influence of coffee drinking on colorectal cancer (crc) is limited, and it remains unclear whether coffee consumption is associated with the risk of the disease. coffee is a rich source of bioactive compounds that have potential anticarcinogenic effects. this study provides support for the protective effect of coffee drinking on colon adenomas, a precursor of colon cancer. results from the recent meta-analysis suggested a moderate favorable effect of coffee consumption on colorectal cancer risk, especially for colon cancer. higher consumption of coffee intake has recently been linked with reduced risk of aggressive prostate cancer (pc) incidence, although meta-analysis of other studies that examine the association between coffee consumption and overall pc risk remains inconclusive. the hypothesis has been raised that coffee consumption may increase the incidence of breast cancer, based on the report that fibrocystic breast disease, a risk factor for breast cancer, regresses after abstention from coffee and other methylxanthines. there was no observational association between coffee intake and overall cancer risk [odds ratio (or) per one cup/day increase = 0.99, 95% confidence interval (ci) 0.98, 1.00] or cancer death (or = 1.01, 0.99, 1.03); the estimated or from mr is 1.01 (0.94, 1.08) for overall cancer risk and 1.11 (0.95, 1.31) for cancer death. coffee is a commonly consumed beverage which contains several potential anticarcinogenic and chemopreventive compounds, and has been hypothesized to have protective effects in colorectal neoplasia. background: consumption of coffee, one of the most popular beverages around the world, has been associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular and all-cause mortality in population-based studies. we studied the effect of unfiltered coffee consumption on putative biomarkers for colonic cancer risk. |||",No
Are there health benefits to screening the general population for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) as a precaution?,No,"The evidence supports the use of a community-screening program to identify and help modify risk factors for COPD.

Prescreening with a COPD-6 screening device has been shown to facilitate early detection of COPD in primary care. There is evidence that lung cancer screening in this population is effective and can potentially reduce mortality. However, until such a study has shown convincing results, and has been followed by a cost-benefit analysis in favor of screening, screening for pre-clinical COPD in general practice should not be recommended.","people with known risk factors for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd) are important targets for screening and early intervention. current and former smokers with copd may disproportionately benefit from lung cancer screening. future trials must evaluate whether screening can improve outcomes for patients with copd. patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd) are at increased risk of developing lung cancer and may benefit from screening at lower pack-year thresholds. the purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a screening program in identifying undiagnosed individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd). early detection of copd may reduce the future burden of the disease. until such a study has shown convincing results, and has been followed by a cost-benefit analysis in favour of screening, screening for pre-clinical copd in general practice should not be recommended. results support the use of a community-screening program to identify and help modify risk factors for copd. to discuss whether screening for early chronic obstructive lung disease (copd) is justifiable. underdiagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd) in primary care can be improved by a more efficient screening strategy. copd is a treatable disease and it is important to identify copd subjects, highlighting the need for an efficient screening measure. screening spirometry might help identify patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd) at an earlier stage. the screening, evaluating and assessing rate changes of diagnosing respiratory conditions in primary care 1 (search1) study assessed whether screening using the copd population screener (copd-ps) questionnaire to detect copd risk factors and symptoms, with or without a handheld spirometer (copd-6) to detect airflow limitation, can increase yields of copd diagnosis and respiratory-related clinician actions in primary care. in primary care, individuals at high risk of copd (ie, age ≥35 years, relevant exposure, and at least one respiratory symptom) and no previous diagnosis of obstructive lung disease were examined with a copd-6 screening device. general practitioners are these days encouraged, from several quarters, to screen their smoking patients for early copd. we aimed to investigate whether prescreening with a copd-6 screening device (measuring fev1 and fev6) facilitates early detection of copd in primary care. this evidence supports the idea of including patients with copd and/or emphysema in lung cancer screening programs. targeted spirometry screening for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd) has been studied in primary care and community settings. to investigate the effectiveness of voluntary lung function screening in bringing to light patients with previously unknown copd and to evaluate the relationships among symptoms, smoking status, and airway obstruction. there is evidence that lung cancer screening in this population is effective and can potentially reduce mortality. |||",No
Can cow's milk cause iron deficiency in babies in the first year of life?,Yes,"The introduction of cow's milk to the diet of infants and young children has been associated with an increased risk of iron deficiency and anemia. The low iron content in cow's milk, coupled with its propensity to displace iron-rich foods from the diet, can lead to inadequate iron intake and subsequent deficiency. Furthermore, the early introduction of cow's milk, before 24 weeks of age, has been linked to iron deficiency and anemia. The use of fresh cow's milk in early infancy has also been found to contribute to the development of measurable degrees of iron deficiency. In many instances, excessive amounts of milk have been shown to produce severe iron deficiency anemia during the second year of life in infants of greater than average birth weight. The feeding of cow's milk to infants is considered undesirable due to its tendency to lead to iron deficiency and its potential to increase the risk of severe dehydration. Therefore, it is recommended that iron-fortified formulas be used during the first year of life if human milk is not available.","the feeding of cow's milk has adverse effects on iron nutrition in infants and young children. early introduction of whole cow's milk may lead to iron deficiency anemia. cows' milk before 24 weeks was associated with iron deficiency and anaemia. early introduction of cow's milk is a risk factor for the development of anaemia and iron deficiency, which is associated with lower childhood developmental scores. the use of fresh cow's milk in early infancy, a common practice, is associated with the development of measurable degrees of iron deficiency. in many instances excessive amounts of milk produce severe iron deficiency anemia during the second year of life in infants of greater than average birth weight. a substantial proportion of southern ontario infants are receiving cow's milk before the recommended age, putting them at increased risk for iron deficiency and the resulting sequelae. in this pooled analysis, cow's milk intake in late infancy associated negatively, and follow-on formula positively, with iron status. introduction of pasteurised cows' milk to the diet of preterm infants before 36 weeks' postnatal age caused iron deficiency without anaemia. consumption of fresh cow's milk and of unfortified cow's milk formulas and cereal products predispose to iron deficiency. whole cow's milk is known to be detrimental to infants, mainly due to its low iron content. the feeding of cow's milk to infants is undesirable because of cow's milk's propensity to lead to iron deficiency and because it unduly increases the risk of severe dehydration. considering the low content in breast milk breastfed infants might be at particular risk for depleted iron stores after the first months of life. the aim of the present study was to investigate associations between iron status among one-year-olds and feeding, with focus on the type of milk. the biologic variability among infants and among their mothers that allows many infants who do not receive iron-fortified foods to prevent iron deficiency while receiving only human milk throughout the first year of life is intriguing and warrants additional study. breastfed infants may be at particular risk for iron deficiency because breast milk is low in iron. studies on iron status in infancy and early childhood have shown contradicting results concerning prolonged breast-feeding and cow's milk intake. given the importance of iron nutrition during the first year of life, there are surprisingly few true, randomized, controlled studies addressing this issue; however, it seems that iron deficiency is unlikely in full-term, breastfed infants during the first 6 months of life because these infants' body iron stores are sufficient to meet requirements. if human milk is not available, it is preferred that iron-fortified formulas rather than whole cow's milk be used during the first year of life. fortified food seems to improve iron status in late infancy. |||",Yes
Does drinking breast milk as a baby have a positive effect on later health and development?,Yes,"Numerous studies have indicated that breast milk consumption during infancy has a positive impact on later health and development. Breast milk is a biologically optimal source of nutrition for newborns and infants, as it contains a nutrient composition that matches their nutritional needs. This nutritional support has been linked to improved neurodevelopment in children, with breastfeeding associated with higher cognitive scores. The positive influence of breast milk on brain development is thought to be mediated by its effects on white matter growth.

     Furthermore, breastfeeding has been associated with a variety of long-term health benefits, including prolonging the birth interval to the subsequent sibling and increasing earning ability. Studies have reported a positive association between the duration of breastfeeding and IQ in childhood, as well as better performance in intelligence tests for subjects who had been breastfed.

     However, it is important to note that observational findings linking breast milk to higher cognitive scores may be confounded by factors associated with mothers' choice to breastfeed. Nonetheless, the overall evidence supports the health-promoting effects of breastfeeding and its positive influence on later health and development.","breast milk has a nutrient composition that matches the nutritional needs of children and is believed to be able to have a positive influence on the infant's growth. breast milk confers many benefits to the newborn and developing infant. breastfeeding has been associated with improved neurodevelopment in children. because cognitive scores are related to head size, we hypothesized that breast milk mediates cognitive effects by affecting brain growth. this study lends further support to the health-promoting effects of breastfeeding. these data support the hypothesis that breast milk promotes brain development, particularly white matter growth. although observational findings linking breast milk to higher scores on cognitive tests may be confounded by factors associated with mothers' choice to breastfeed, it has been suggested that one or more constituents of breast milk facilitate cognitive development, particularly in preterms. good habits of breastfeeding have been associated with many long-term health benefits. recently data have started to emerge showing that breastfeeding may also induce positive effects in the mother. beyond somatic growth, breast milk as a biologic fluid has a variety of other benefits, including modulation of postnatal intestinal function, immune ontogeny, and brain development. a high percentage of breastfeeds among all milk feeds accumulated during the first 14 months was positively related with child mental development (0.37 points per month of full breastfeeding [95% confidence interval: 0.06-0.67]). more short-term outcomes, such as incidence and duration of illness, nutrient status, and cognitive development during the first year of life also demonstrate benefits of breastfeeding. in this article, we ask whether breastfeeding for more than 2 years is associated with discernible health and well-being benefits to children. greater levels of accumulated breastfeeding during the first year of life were related to higher mental development at 14 months, largely independently from a wide range of parental psychosocial factors. breastfeeding has been associated with numerous health and well-being benefits for both children and their mothers, including prolonging the birth interval to the subsequent sibling. in addition, this association between breastfeeding and development has long-term consequences on human capital, increasing earning ability. in the present review, we identified two studies that reported that duration of breastfeeding was positively associated with iq in childhood, whereas another study reported that cognitive score at 67.9 years of age was higher among those subjects who had been breastfed for at least 6 months. concerning its long-term consequences, it has been reported that subjects who had been breastfed would have a better performance in intelligence tests. in this review, we perused the recently published studies on the association of breastfeeding with developmental outcomes. our results indicate a strong positive relationship between breastfeeding for 2 or more years and interbirth interval, but little evidence for a relationship between prolonged breastfeeding and several indicators of child growth and health. |||",Yes
"Do large portions, large plates or glasses, and larger packaging cause us to eat and drink more?",Yes,"Justification: The context indicates that larger portion sizes of foods and beverages lead to increased energy intake and consumption. This is supported by the ""portion size effect,"" where individuals consume more food when served larger portions. The size of the container, such as plates and glasses, also plays a role in food consumption, with larger containers leading to increased intake. Additionally, the context suggests that portion distortion, or perceiving large portion sizes as appropriate, contributes to increased energy intakes and expanding waistlines. Therefore, it can be concluded that large portions, large plates or glasses, and larger packaging do cause us to eat and drink more.","larger portion sizes of foods and beverages could affect overall energy intake at meals and promote overeating. while it is well-known that larger food portions lead to increased consumption (i.e., the portion size effect), previous studies confound the effect of the size and the number of food units making up the larger portion. the robust effect of portion size on intake has led to growing interest in why individuals consume more food when served larger portions. people typically eat more from large portions of food than from small portions. relative consumption ratios are higher when participants were served portions made up of enlarged food units compared to more food units. portion size is a key environmental driver of energy intake, and larger-than-appropriate portion sizes could increase the risk of weight gain. large portions increase intake and are hypothesized to contribute to the obesity epidemic. large portions of food are often blamed for rising rates of obesity. in building on the size-contrast illusion, this research examines whether the size of a bowl or serving spoon unknowingly biases how much a person serves and eats. in the past decades, portion sizes of high-caloric foods and drinks have increased and can be considered an important environmental obesogenic factor. the increase in the prevalence of obesity has coincided with an increase in portion sizes of foods both inside and outside the home, suggesting that larger portions may play a role in the obesity epidemic. in contrast to those in studies involving larger-sized plates and spoons, people serving from larger bowls felt more satiated. food appears larger if plated on smaller dishes than larger dishes and liquid volumes appear larger in taller cups than shorter cups. portion distortion (perceiving large portion sizes as appropriate amounts to eat at a single eating occasion) may contribute to increasing energy intakes and expanding waistlines. study 3 (n = 189) considers both perceived quantity and consumption and demonstrates that perceived quantity indeed mediates the effect of food portion size on consumption. the effect of container size of food and drinks as well as the effect of the variety of drinks on the selecting behaviors of male and female undergraduates were investigated in this research by manipulating the sizes of plates and glasses. these findings again highlight the role that external cues play in food consumption and show the importance of considering serving bowl size in nutrition education. this review of studies into the effects of portion size on energy intake shows that increased food portion sizes lead to increased energy intake levels. a number of studies also support an influence of orosensory processing on the portion size effect; large portions have been shown to relate to increased bite size and faster eating rate. portion sizes for certain foods have been increasing dramatically in recent years alongside obesity rates, concurring with the phenomenon of the portion size effect (more is consumed when more is offered). |||",Yes
Do kava kava supplements help with anxiety disorders?,Yes,"Recent clinical trials suggest that kava (piper methysticum) has therapeutic value for the treatment of anxiety.

"Does the risk of food allergy decrease if babies are fed potentially allergenic foods (cow's milk, peanuts, chicken egg) as late as possible for the first time?",No,"The risk of food allergy does not decrease if babies are fed potentially allergenic foods as late as possible for the first time. In fact, recent findings suggest that early exposure to dietary antigens, including potentially allergenic foods such as cow's milk, peanuts, and chicken eggs, may be more protective towards allergy than a later introduction. This is supported by research indicating that early introduction of allergenic solid foods, especially peanut and hen's egg, reduces the risk of food allergy development in early childhood. Furthermore, there is no evidence that delaying the introduction of any specific food beyond 6 months of age helps to prevent allergy. On the contrary, exposure to cow's milk protein in the first 3 months of life has been associated with a reduced risk of cow's milk allergy. Therefore, the conventional wisdom that early exposure to allergenic food proteins during pregnancy, lactation, or infancy leads to food allergies is not supported by recent research.","we evaluated whether the early introduction of allergenic foods in the diet of breast-fed infants would protect against the development of food allergy. recent findings suggest that an early exposure to dietary antigens may be more protective towards allergy than a later introduction even in high-risk infants. overall early exposure to allergenic foods in the infant's diet is a new strategy for preventing food allergy to that allergen, but the optimal timing of exposure for different allergens is not known. this review focuses on the timing of food introduction as a preventative strategy for food allergy and also discusses other aspects of the infant diet that may provide opportunities for prevention of atopic disease. recent research also appears to suggest that early introduction of potentially allergenic foods (at 4 to 6 months of age) might actually provide a form of protection and help prevent allergy, but more research is needed. the conventional wisdom is that early exposure to allergenic food proteins during pregnancy, lactation, or infancy leads to food allergies, and that prevention strategies should therefore aim to eliminate allergenic food proteins during pregnancy, breastfeeding, and early childhood. introduction of allergenic solid foods, especially peanut and hen's egg reduces the risk of food allergy development in early childhood. answer there is no evidence that delaying the introduction of any specific food beyond 6 months of age helps to prevent allergy. exposure to cow's milk protein in the first 3 months of life was associated with a reduced risk of cow's milk allergy. question i have been under the impression that infants should avoid potential allergenic foods such as nuts, cow's milk, and eggs in order to avoid developing allergic reactions. high-risk infants feeding exclusively on breast milk and/or extensively hydrolysed formula (ehf) combined with avoidance of cow's milk proteins and solid foods during at least the first 4 months of life are found to have a significant reduction in the cumulative incidence of food allergy, especially cow's milk protein allergy/intolerance (cmpa/cmpi), in the first 4 years of life. in high risk infants, a combined approach, where breastfeeding with maternal avoidance of highly allergenic foods, supplemented by extensively hydrolysed formula during the first 6 months of life, in addition to the delayed introduction of solid foods, has been shown to reduce the development of food allergy in infants. a delayed introduction of solids (past 4 or 6 months) was not associated with decreased odds for asthma, allergic rhinitis, or sensitization against food or inhalant allergens at 6 years of age. infant feeding guidelines have long recommended delaying introduction of solids and allergenic foods to prevent allergy in high-risk infants, despite a paucity of evidence. we aimed to examine the relationship between exposure to cow's milk protein in the first 3 months of life and risk of cow's milk allergy at age 12 months. we recruited, from the general population, 1303 exclusively breast-fed infants who were 3 months of age and randomly assigned them to the early introduction of six allergenic foods (peanut, cooked egg, cow's milk, sesame, whitefish, and wheat; early-introduction group) or to the current practice recommended in the united kingdom of exclusive breast-feeding to approximately 6 months of age (standard-introduction group). changes in infant feeding guidelines could have a significant effect on childhood egg allergy and possibly food allergy more generally. this study investigates whether a delayed introduction of solids (past 4 or 6 months) is protective against the development of eczema, asthma, allergic rhinitis, and food or inhalant sensitization at the age of 6 years. early exposure to cow's milk protein was associated with a reduced risk of cow's milk sensitization (adjusted odds ratio [aor] 0.44, 95% confidence interval [ci] 0.23-0.83), parent-reported reactions to cow's milk (aor 0.44, 95% ci 0.29-0.67), and cow's milk allergy (aor 0.31, 95% ci 0.10-0.91) at age 12 months. specifically, new guidelines suggest early ingestion of peanut as a means to prevent peanut allergy. |||",No
"for fish, sesame, wheat?",No,"The provided context does not contain information regarding the combination of fish, sesame, and wheat in a diet. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer to the question. However, the context does mention that fish and seafood are important sources of essential vitamins, minerals, and fatty acids, and that plant materials, including wheat and legumes, make up a significant part of aquafeeds. The context also discusses the use of plant-based protein sources, such as soy, pea protein concentrate, and wheat gluten, in customized fish feed. However, there is no mention of sesame in the context.","fish and seafood may play an important role for nutrition and food security as they contain essential vitamins, minerals, and essential fatty acids. this new method was considered as fit-for-purpose and applied for the analysis of customised fish feed containing wheat gluten, soy, or pea protein concentrate as well as salmon and zebrafish fed on diets with these ingredients for a period of up to eight weeks. atlantic salmon were fed diets where fo was partly (80%) replaced with three different vos; rapeseed oil (ro), olive oil (oo) or soy bean oil (so). the purpose of this study is to determine response of dietary substitution of fishmeal with silkworm pupae meal, promate meal®, meat and bone meal and/or their combination on the performance of juvenile olive flounder. they consisted of smoked fish: whitefish, butterfish, sprat, trout, herring (kippers) and mackerel, and frozen fish: butterfish, norwegian salmon, sole, grenadier and panga. presently, plant materials including wheat and legumes make up the largest part of aquafeeds, so evaluation of the transfer capabilities of typical toxic metabolites from plant-infesting fungi and of vegetable phytoestrogens into fish products is of great importance. on average, people ate fish in about 10 meals a week, chicken for eight meals, and shrimp and pork for about six meals each. including 100 g of sardine or anchovy (whole fish) in the diet, would contribute substantially to the rni for vitamin b12, vitamin d and vitamin a, epa and dha as well as the minerals iodine, zinc, and calcium. the present work tested fishmeal replacement by a mixture of plant meals at different levels, as well as the use of marine by-products with attractant properties and high-quality protein in high plant protein diets. to determine niacin content in sea fish that are commonly available on the polish market and to assess whether this dietary source is sufficient to satisfy the rda requirements for various age groups of selected subjects living in poland. with the aim of evaluating long-term effects of vegetable diets on growth and intestinal status of the on-growing gilthead seabream (initial weight = 129 g), three experimental diets were tested: a strict plant protein-based diet (vm), a fishmeal based diet (fm) and a plant protein-based diet with 15% of marine ingredients (squid and krill meal) alternative to fishmeal (vm+). both from a health and sustainability perspective, however, it is important to consider the optimum number of fish servings per week and to examine whether fish and plant protein can be brought under the same heading of alternative protein sources. the objective of this work was to study the effects of partial substitution of fish meal with lupin and rapeseed meals on gut microbiota of the gilthead sea bream (sparus aurata) and in goldfish (carassius auratus). all the analyzed fish species were good dietary sources of several vitamins and minerals and whole fish were substantially more nutrient dense than fillet samples, especially with regard to vitamin a, iodine, zinc, calcium, and iron. as expected, fish and shellfish played an important role in their daily diets. fish has several benefits that make it a desirable part of a healthy diet. the results are in line with current dutch recommendations that encourage consumers to eat one serving of fish per week and that stimulate those who already eat more than one serving of fish to replace the rest by plant-based protein sources. these results support the strategy of developing eco-innovative biofortified farmed fish using sustainable, natural, safe and high-quality ingredients in feeds, to enable consumers to overcome nutritional deficiencies without significantly increased feed costs. the results showed that the hypothesis needed to be nuanced: fish consumption was associated exclusively with affinity with spicy meals based on authentic plant protein sources (e.g. the aim of this study was to describe the nutrient composition, including fatty acids, amino acids, vitamins, and minerals, in commonly consumed fish species (fillet- and whole fish samples) sampled off the northwest african coast. |||",No
"Can a supposedly ""high acid"" diet weaken bones?",No,"The evidence suggests that a high acid-producing diet can have detrimental effects on bone health. This type of diet generates increased urinary acid and calcium excretion, which can lead to a slight, but significant, metabolic acidosis. This metabolic acidosis may result in greater loss of bone mineral and increased potential for fractures. Acidosis-induced increases in cortisol secretion and plasma concentration may also play a role in alterations in bone metabolism and osteoporosis. Furthermore, a chronic net dietary acid load may have adverse consequences on bone, including increased bone resorption and decreased bone formation. However, it is important to note that sufficient calcium intake might neutralize this effect.","evidence exists that a more acidic diet is detrimental to bone health. while it is clear that a high acid-producing diet generates increased urinary acid and calcium excretion, the effect of diet does not always have the expected results on bmd, fracture risk and markers of bone formation and resorption, suggesting that other factors are influencing the effect of acid/alkali loading on bone. high dietary acid load may be detrimental to bone mineral density (bmd), although sufficient calcium intake might neutralize this effect. we hypothesize that a slight, but significant, metabolic acidosis leads to greater loss of bone mineral and increase potential to fracture. acidosis-induced increases in cortisol secretion and plasma concentration may play a role in mild acidosis-induced alterations in bone metabolism and possibly in osteoporosis associated with an acidogenic western diet. this hypothesis posits that foods associated with an increased urinary acid excretion are deleterious for the skeleton, leading to osteoporosis and enhanced fragility fracture risk. imbalance between dietary acid and base precursors leads to a chronic net dietary acid load that may have adverse consequences on bone. these results suggest that, with a possible exception of older men, dietary acid load does not have a measureable negative effect on bone health, regardless of total calcium intake. a causal association between dietary acid load and osteoporotic bone disease is not supported by evidence and there is no evidence that an alkaline diet is protective of bone health. an acidogenic western diet results in mild metabolic acidosis in association with a state of cortisol excess, altered divalent ion metabolism, and increased bone resorptive indices. it is known that a dietary acid load is harmful to bone, and sulfur-containing amino acids are metabolized to provide such an acid load. acidifying constituents such as animal proteins may negatively affect calcium metabolism and accelerate bone resorption, thus representing an aggravating factor for osteoporosis. notwithstanding this questionable role of bone mineral in systemic acid-base equilibrium, not only in ckd but even more in the absence of renal impairment, it is postulated that, in healthy individuals, foods, particularly those containing animal protein, would induce 'latent' acidosis and result, in the long run, in osteoporosis.thus, a questionable interpretation of data from patients with ckd and the subsequent extrapolation to healthy subjects converted a hypothesis into nutritional recommendations for the prevention of osteoporosis. chronic acid loads result in hypercalciuria and negative calcium balance often associated with loss of bone mineral. on the basis of observations that calcium retention and inhibition of bone resorption result from alkali administration, it is assumed that the acid load inherent in this diet is responsible for increased bone resorption and calcium loss from bone. on a more chronic basis metabolic acidosis alters bone cell function; there is an increase in osteoclastic bone resorption and a decrease in osteoblastic bone formation. in vitro studies demonstrate that bone is degraded in an acidic environment due to chemical reactions and through effects on bone cells. the findings suggest that the critical determinant of hip fracture risk in relation to the acid-base effects of diet is the net load of acid in the diet, when the intake of both acid and base precursors is considered. the objective of this systematic review was to evaluate causal relationships between dietary acid load and osteoporosis using hill's criteria. it has been discussed in the literature that conditions associated with decreased stomach acidity may lead to a decrease in intestinal calcium absorption and, consequently, to an increased fracture risk. |||",No
Is surgery for an anterior cruciate ligament tear (by replacing the broken anterior cruciate ligament with tendon tissue from another part of the leg) followed by physical therapy better than physical therapy alone?,No,"The effectiveness of surgical treatment compared to conservative treatment for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries remains controversial. A randomized controlled trial found no significant difference in outcomes between early ACL reconstruction (ACLR) with rehabilitation and optional delayed ACLR with rehabilitation. Furthermore, a quasi-randomized trial of 167 people with complete ACL rupture found no difference in the return to sports activities between those treated surgically and those treated conservatively. Therefore, it cannot be definitively stated that surgery for an ACL tear followed by physical therapy is superior to physical therapy alone.","injuries to the anterior cruciate ligament (acl) are currently treated with replacement of the torn ligament with a graft of tendon harvested from elsewhere in the knee. whether surgical or conservative treatment is more effective in allowing patients to return to physical activity after anterior cruciate ligament (acl) injury is controversial. anterior cruciate ligament (acl) injuries are currently treated by removing the injured ligament and replacing it with a tendon graft. evaluation of the effect of surgical treatment compared with conservative treatment of anterior cruciate ligament (acl) rupture. anterior cruciate ligament (acl) tears can either be treated nonoperatively with physical therapy and then treated operatively if persistent instability is present, or be directly treated operatively. the kanon (knee anterior cruciate ligament, non-surgical versus surgical treatment) randomized controlled trial compared rehabilitation plus early acl reconstruction (aclr) to rehabilitation plus optional delayed aclr and found no difference at 2 years by an intention-to-treat analysis of total knee injury and osteoarthritis outcome score (koos) results. an initial anterior cruciate ligament (acl) tear can be treated with surgical reconstruction or focused rehabilitation. the current gold standard for the treatment of an anterior cruciate ligament (acl) rupture is reconstruction with tendon graft. the standard treatment of acl injury remains ligament reconstruction followed by a postoperative physiotherapeutic procedure. advantages of early acl reconstruction surgery include shorter time from injury to surgery and potentially fewer meniscal injuries, but performing early acl reconstruction in all patients results in surgery in patients who might not need acl reconstruction. anterior cruciate ligament (acl) reconstruction using tendon or ligament autograft is the gold standard surgical treatment for acute ruptures; however, this is still associated with subsequent problems and variable outcomes. we compared anterior cruciate ligament function in skeletally mature patients after treatment of tibial eminence fractures with that of patients in two other groups: patients who had anterior cruciate ligament deficiency and patients who had undergone anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using bone-patellar tendon-bone autografts. one quasi-randomised trial of 167 people with a complete acl rupture treated with repair or augmented repair versus conservative treatment found no difference in the return to sports activities between people treated surgically and those treated conservatively. this study revealed that competitive athletes who underwent reconstruction at a subacute stage after the anterior cruciate ligament injury had a higher activity level 2-5.5 years after the index operation, as well as a higher desired level of activity compared to athletes who had the reconstruction delayed by 12-24 months. anterior cruciate ligament (acl) rupture is a common ligamentous injury that often requires surgery because the acl does not heal well without intervention. renewed interest in healing of injured acl tissue has led to new surgical repair techniques. rehabilitation after repair of the anterior cruciate ligament (acl) is complicated by the loss of leg muscle mass and strength. the purpose of this study was to compare the clinical outcome of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction done with a double-bundle technique with use of a quadriceps tendon-bone autograft and that of a single-bundle reconstruction with use of a bone-patellar tendon-bone autograft in patients with generalized ligamentous laxity. it is important to assess in which patients nonoperative treatment is successful and which patients will require acl reconstruction and thus might be better treated surgically in an earlier phase. a standard treatment option for acl complete rupture in active young patients is debridement of remnant tissue and reconstruction with various types of tendon graft. |||",No
Can motherwort reduce migraine attacks?,Yes,"The context suggests that motherwort has been used as a medicinal herb for many years in both China and Europe, and has been shown to have beneficial effects for women's diseases.

The context mentions a randomized controlled clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of acupuncture compared with naproxen in menstrual-related migraine patients, but does not mention motherwort as a treatment option. Additionally, the context mentions that treatment of motherwort ethanol extract in vivo markedly suppressed the development of uterine adenomyosis and mammary cancers in mice, but this does not necessarily indicate that motherwort can reduce migraine attacks. Therefore, based on the information provided in the context, it is not possible to determine whether motherwort can reduce migraine attacks.","a review of treatment options for menstrual migraine. an anecdotal survey in our clinical practices suggested that milnacipran, a drug indicated for the treatment of fibromyalgia, reduced the incidence of headache in patients with migraine. motherwort has been used as medicinal herb for many years in both china and europe. most epidemiological studies demonstrate that women suffering from migraine note a significant improvement in their headaches during pregnancy. most epidemiological studies demonstrate that women suffering from migraine note significant improvement of their headaches during pregnancy. these women may respond to hormonal interventions, which may reduce the frequency of menstrual migraines, thereby lessening the need for abortive migraine therapies, decreasing migraine-related disability, and improving quality of life. oc use can result in worsening, improvement, or no change in a woman's migraine. acute and preventive treatment of migraine during pregnancy and lactation is discussed, with an emphasis on safety to the fetus and nursing infant. migraine is a common headache disorder that affects mostly women. migraine often, but not always, improves during pregnancy. motherwort (yimucao), a traditional chinese herb, has been shown beneficial effects for women's diseases. we design and perform a randomized controlled clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of acupuncture compared with naproxen in menstrual-related migraine patients. however, treatment of motherwort ethanol extract in vivo markedly suppressed the development of uterine adenomyosis and mammary cancers in mice. acupuncture may be a choice for menstrual-related migraine, when pharmacological prophylaxis is not suitable. we hypothesized that these beneficial effects of motherwort may be related to angiogenesis. labetalol was tried successfully in reducing the frequency, duration, and intensity of migraine attacks in a pregnant woman with preeclampsia. in particular, chinese motherwort has been commonly used to treat disorders of mammary gland in chinese traditional medicine (tcm). chinese motherwort aqueous extract (mae)was previously reported to have anti-cancer activity in breast cancer cells with low potency (ic50s in a range of 8-40 mg/ml). a fixed-dose combination tablet containing sumatriptan and naproxen sodium significantly improved patient satisfaction, productivity, and restoration of normal functioning in menstrual migraineurs with dysmenorrhea. ), and chinese patent medicines derived from motherwort, alleviate postpartum uterine subinvolution, as well as the effects on myocardial and cerebral ischemic injuries. |||",Yes
Does the herbal hormone genistein reduce the number and intensity of hot flashes during menopause???,Yes,"The herbal hormone genistein has been shown to reduce the number and intensity of hot flashes during menopause. In a 24-month, prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, pure administration of genistein (54 mg/d) was found to reduce the number and severity of hot flushes in postmenopausal women, with no adverse effect on the endometrium and vagina. Genistein supplemented subjects demonstrated a 51% reduction in the number of hot flushes by week 12 compared to a 27% reduction in the placebo group. The current study provides the first evidence that a single daily dose of 30 mg of synthetic genistein reduces hot flush frequency and duration. Genistein has also been shown to have a preventive role against bone mass loss during menopause and may provide an alternative to hormone therapy in those patients at risk for ischemic events.","to evaluate in a 24-month, prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study whether pure administration of the phytoestrogen genistein (54 mg/d) might reduce the number and severity of hot flushes in postmenopausal women, with no adverse effect on the endometrium and vagina. the phytoestrogen genistein has been shown to be effective on vasomotor symptoms without an adverse effect on the endometrium and vagina, but after the first year, there was no further improvement in the decrease in hot flushes. phytoestrogens have recently been claimed to positively influence menopausal discomforts, including hot flashes. the phytoestrogens are capable of reducing hot flashes via their oestrogen-like hormone actions. the current study provides the first evidence that a single daily dose of 30 mg of synthetic genistein reduces hot flush frequency and duration. genistein has a preventive role against bone mass loss during menopause. the results of our study do not confirm effects of genistein on activation of the haemostatic system, but on the contrary the significant decrease of dd could indicate a possible cardioprotective role of genistein in postmenopausal women. genistein is a plant estrogen promoted as an alternative to post-menopausal hormone therapy because of a good safety profile and its promotion as a natural product. genistein supplemented subjects completing at least 4 weeks on trial (n=40) demonstrated a 51% reduction (9.4-4.7/day) in the number of hot flushes by week 12 compared to a 27% reduction in the placebo group (9.9-7.1/day) (p=0.026). despite the lack of significant changes in physical characteristics, 2-day treatment with genistein was associated with significant cardioprotective effects in ovx rats, suggesting a potential therapeutic role in postmenopausal women. importantly, genistein lacks some of the detrimental effects associated with post-menopausal estrogen treatment and may provide an alternative to hormone therapy in those patients at risk for ischemic events. this article discusses the superior efficacy of the newer nonhormonal prescriptions for the treatment of hot flashes when compared with estrogen replacement therapy, and provides some recommendations regarding use of them in peri- and postmenopausal women. to investigate the efficacy and tolerability of gabapentin for the treatment of menopausal hot flashes, we performed a systematic review of all trials reporting on the efficacy and tolerability of gabapentin in women with hot flashes and a meta-analysis of the randomized controlled trials (rcts) conducted in this patient population. women assigned to gabapentin reported a significantly greater percent reduction in both the frequency of hot flashes (wmd = 23.72 [95% ci, 16.46-30.97]; p < 0.001) and the composite score (wmd = 27.26 [95% ci, 21.24-33.29]; p < 0.001), with significant between-study heterogeneity (i(2) = 97.8% and 95.6%, respectively). the effects of phytoestrogens on these mechanisms may help explain their beneficial effects in alleviating hot flashes and other menopausal discomforts. various non-hormonal agents have been used for the treatment of hot flashes in women with menopause. genistein being a phytoestrogen imitates the characteristics of estrogen, which can be useful to treat conditions by reducing the estrogen levels at the time of menopause, osteoporosis and high risk for breast cancer. genistein, a naturally occurring isoflavonic phytoestrogen associated with reduced incidence of heart disease, may be a possible alternative treatment for postmenopausal women with heart disease. subjects on genistein (n=32) completing 12 weeks on trial demonstrated a 51% reduction (9.7-4.7/day) in the number of hot flushes by week 12 (p=0.049) compared to 30% reduction in the placebo group (9.8-7.0/day) and had fewer hot flushes per day and a decrease in total duration of hot flushes per day at week 12 compared to placebo (p=0.020 and p=0.017, respectively). to evaluate the efficacy of synthetic genistein for reducing the frequency and severity of hot flushes. |||",Yes
Does treatment according to the fascial distortion model help with chronic shoulder pain?,Yes,"The provided context does not mention the fascial distortion model as a treatment for chronic shoulder pain. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether treatment according to this model is effective in reducing chronic shoulder pain. The context does, however, provide evidence that various interventions, such as multimodal treatment of myofascial trigger points, manipulative therapy, and minimally invasive treatments, can be effective in reducing pain, increasing range of motion, and improving function in patients with chronic shoulder pain.","the reviewed interventions seem to be effective in reducing pain, increasing range of motion and improving function of the painful shoulder. shoulder pain is a common musculoskeletal problem that is often chronic or recurrent. the aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness of multimodal treatment of mtrps in patients with chronic shoulder pain. this meta-analysis assessed the short-term to midterm effectiveness of minimally invasive treatments in the management of calcifying tendinopathy of the shoulder cuff, a common source of chronic shoulder pain that leads to pain, a decreased active range of motion, and loss of muscular strength. a case then exists for the use of treatments aimed at reversing these changes, training the brain to reduce chronic shoulder pain. to examine current evidence associated with myofascial origin of shoulder pain, with emphasis on diagnosis, prevalence and treatment efficacy. the results of this study show that 12-week comprehensive treatment of mtrps in shoulder muscles reduces the number of muscles with active mtrps and is effective in reducing symptoms and improving shoulder function in patients with chronic shoulder pain. persistent shoulder pain is a highly prevalent problem, due to different pathologies, that is frequently associated with limited range of motion and decreased function. to study the effectiveness of manipulative therapy for the shoulder girdle in addition to usual medical care for relief of shoulder pain and dysfunction. shoulder pain is a common problem imposing a considerable burden on the affected person and society. describe current physiotherapeutic diagnostic- and therapeutic management, including the use of diagnostic ultrasound, in patients with shoulder pain in primary care. manipulative therapy for the shoulder girdle in addition to usual medical care accelerates recovery of shoulder symptoms. the objective of the study was to evaluate the role of experimentally-induced sub-acromial pain on shoulder isokinetic rotational strength and throwing accuracy. this paper addresses the anatomic and biomechanical mechanisms of shoulder motion and presents a logical approach to diagnosis and osteopathic treatment of the sore shoulder. shoulder pain is a common condition associated with slow recovery and high recurrence rates. shoulder impingement syndrome (sis) is the most common form of shoulder pain and a persistent musculoskeletal problem. cox proportional hazards modeling was used to assess the associations between shoulder symptoms and demand-control model quadrants. shoulder injuries are a common cause of pain and discomfort. by understanding the role of pain on shoulder function, clinicians will be able to more efficiently assess and treat shoulder injuries. the present study addressed whether abnormal changes in cortical surface structure exist in patients with chronic shoulder pain of myofascial origin and whether such changes would be related to pain measures. |||",Yes
Are there effective alternatives to the breathing mask (CPAP) for sleep apnea?,No,"Justification: Several alternatives to CPAP have been proposed for the treatment of sleep apnea. Adaptive servoventilation (ASV) has been found to be more effective than CPAP in relieving complex sleep apnea syndrome. Additionally, drug therapy has been proposed as an alternative to CPAP in some patients with mild to moderate sleep apnea. Oral appliances are also an alternative to CPAP for the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea. However, the effectiveness of these alternatives may vary depending on the severity and type of sleep apnea, and further research is needed to determine their long-term efficacy and safety.","cpap applied by a nasal mask is the gold standard treatment of obstructive sleep apnea. a number of therapeutic alternatives to continuous positive airway pressure (cpap) and surgery have been proposed to treat sleep apnea syndrome. continuous positive airway pressure (cpap) delivered by nasal mask is the gold standard treatment for obstructive sleep apnea (osa). ventilation with continuous positive airway pressure (cpap) is the gold standard therapy for obstructive sleep apnea (osa). recently, several innovative alternatives to cpap have been developed. continuous positive airway pressure (cpap) is the first-choice treatment for obstructive sleep-disordered breathing. continuous positive airways pressure (cpap) is the accepted therapy for obstructive sleep apnoea (osa), but compliance is variable. for most patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (osa), continuous positive airway pressure (cpap) is an effective therapy. adaptive servoventilation (asv) was more reliably effective than cpap in relieving complex sleep apnea syndrome. drug therapy has been proposed as an alternative to cpap in some patients with mild to moderate sleep apnoea. continuous positive airway pressure (cpap) is the first-line treatment for the majority of patients affected by obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (osa). although continuous positive airway pressure therapy (cpap) is the treatment of choice for obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome (osas), there is a portion of patients in which cpap is not usable. the treatment of choice for moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnoea (osa) is continuous positive airway pressure (cpap) via a mask during sleep. continuous positive airway pressure (cpap) therapy is the first-line treatment for obstructive sleep apnea (osa). oral appliances are an alternative to continuous positive airway pressure (cpap) for the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea (osa). it is unclear whether continuous positive airway pressure (cpap), the treatment of choice for severe obstructive sleep apnoea (osa), is effective at improving outcomes in mild osa. the treatment of obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome (osas) is still a matter of debate; among the different therapeutic alternatives, both surgical and conservative, treatment with continuous positive airway pressure (cpap) is considered the ""gold standard"". prior studies show that adaptive servoventilation (asv) is initially more effective than continuous positive airway pressure (cpap) for patients with complex sleep apnea syndrome (compsas), but choosing therapies has been controversial because residual central breathing events may resolve over time in many patients receiving chronic cpap therapy. evidence for the management of cpap-treated obstructive sleep apnea suggests that oronasal masks reduce mouth leaks at the expense of higher pressures and poorer adherence. although the gold standard for the treatment of osa, cpap may not be the optimal modality to treat more complex sleep disordered breathing such as cheyne-stokes respirations, opioid-induced central apnea, and complex sleep disordered breathing related to chronic hypoventilation syndromes (obesity-hypoventilation syndrome, restrictive thoracic disease due to neuromuscular or thoracic cage disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). |||",No
Does closure of the foramen ovale prevent further strokes in people who have had a stroke of unknown cause?,Yes,"The efficacy of closure of a patent foramen ovale (PFO) in the prevention of recurrent stroke after cryptogenic stroke is uncertain. While PFO closure may prevent recurrent stroke in patients aged 60 years or younger, the effect of foramen ovale closure on the risk for subsequent strokes is unknown. In the primary intention-to-treat analysis, there was no significant benefit associated with closure of a PFO in adults who had had a cryptogenic ischemic stroke. However, collaboration between investigators has yielded a database with sufficient power to identify those patients at highest risk for a PFO-related stroke recurrence who may have the greatest potential benefit from PFO closure. Transcatheter closure of a PFO can be accomplished with little morbidity and may reduce the risk of recurrence. However, the available research results do not conclusively suggest a causal relationship between PFO and stroke. Therefore, the question of whether closure of the foramen ovale prevents further strokes in people who have had a stroke of unknown cause remains unresolved.","whether closure of a patent foramen ovale is effective in the prevention of recurrent ischemic stroke in patients who have had a cryptogenic stroke is unknown. the efficacy of closure of a patent foramen ovale (pfo) in the prevention of recurrent stroke after cryptogenic stroke is uncertain. detecting a benefit from closure of patent foramen ovale in patients with cryptogenic stroke is hampered by low rates of stroke recurrence and uncertainty about the causal role of patent foramen ovale in the index event. we aimed to determine whether patent foramen ovale closure reduces the risk of stroke, also assessing some safety outcomes. the clinical benefit of closing a patent foramen ovale after a cryptogenic stroke has been an open question for several decades, so that it is necessary to review the current state of published medical data in this regard. patent foramen ovale (pfo) closure may prevent recurrent stroke after cryptogenic transient ischemic attack (tia) or stroke (tia/stroke) in patients aged 60 years or younger. the effect of foramen ovale closure on the risk for subsequent strokes is unknown. the role of surgical closure of patent foramen ovale (pfo) for cerebral infarction (ci) or transient ischemic attack (tia) resulting from paradoxical embolism is unclear, and its effect on recurrence is unknown. paradoxical embolism through a patent foramen ovale is a recognized cause of stroke, but clinical predictors, recurrence rate, and prevention of brain infarcts in patients with patent foramen ovale have not been determined. patent foramen ovale is associated with cryptogenic stroke in the older population, but risk of recurrence is unknown. patent foramen ovale is associated with ischemic stroke in patients without a clearly identifiable etiology for stroke (cryptogenic stroke). however, patent foramen ovale is also found in patients with known cause of stroke. prevention of recurrence in subjects with presumed patent foramen ovale-related brain infarcts varied. in the primary intention-to-treat analysis, there was no significant benefit associated with closure of a patent foramen ovale in adults who had had a cryptogenic ischemic stroke. while individual studies are inadequate for modeling patent foramen ovale-attributable recurrence risk, collaboration between investigators has yielded a database with sufficient power to identify those patients at highest risk for a patent foramen ovale-related stroke recurrence who may have the greatest potential benefit from patent foramen ovale closure. the available research results do not conclusively suggest a causal relationship between patent foramen ovale and stroke. the subject of secondary prevention in patients with cryptogenic stroke and patent foramen ovale, including the results of research into the effectiveness of pharmacological methods and percutaneous closure of interatrial septal defects, is raised. several studies have shown an association of cryptogenic stroke and embolism with patent foramen ovale (pfo), but the question how to prevent further events in such patients is unresolved. closure of patent foramen ovale following presumed paradoxical embolic stroke remains controversial. transcatheter closure of a patent foramen ovale can be accomplished with little morbidity and may reduce the risk of recurrence. |||",Yes
Does taking magnesium salts decrease the frequency and intensity of muscle cramps with unknown cause?,No,"The claim that taking magnesium salts decreases the frequency and intensity of muscle cramps with unknown cause is not supported by the provided context. A double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized controlled trial was conducted on 46 community-dwelling older adult rest cramp sufferers to determine whether 5 consecutive days infusion of 20-mmol (5 g) magnesium sulfate would reduce the frequency of leg cramps per week. The results showed that intravenous magnesium infusion did not reduce the frequency of leg cramps in a group of older adult rest cramp sufferers regardless of the extent to which infused magnesium was retained. The mean change in number of cramps per week, magnesium versus placebo arms, was -2.4 versus -1.7, p = .51, 95% confidence interval of the difference -3.1 to 1.7.

Does taking magnesium salts reduce the frequency and intensity of muscle cramps in pregnancy?,Yes,"The use of magnesium salts for the treatment of leg cramps during pregnancy is a controversial issue, as evidenced by a recent Cochrane systematic review. The study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of magnesium supplementation in treating leg cramps in pregnancy. However, the results indicate that oral magnesium supplementation during pregnancy did not reduce the occurrence and frequency of episodes of leg cramps. Although magnesium sulfate has been shown to decrease the frequency of uterine contractions, this effect does not appear to extend to leg cramps. The use of magnesium sulfate during labor in women with mild preeclampsia did not affect any component of labor but did necessitate a higher dose of oxytocin. Therefore, based on the available evidence, it cannot be concluded that taking magnesium salts reduces the frequency and intensity of muscle cramps in pregnancy.","oral magnesium supplementation during pregnancy did not reduce the ocurrence and frequency of episodes of leg cramps. oral magnesium for leg cramps treatment in pregnancy is a controversial issue according to recent cochrane systematic review. this study aims to evaluate the efficacy of mg++ supplementation in leg cramps treatment in pregnancy. magnesium sulfate has been shown in vivo and in vitro to decrease the frequency of uterine contractions while maintaining the amplitude; we therefore decided to assess the use of magnesium sulfate infusion in cases of uterine hyperstimulation. randomised and quasi-randomised trials of dietary magnesium supplementation during pregnancy. randomised and quasi-randomised trials of dietary magnesium supplementation during pregnancy. induced contractions were reduced, in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner (maximum effect at 20 min), at higher mg2+ concentrations and with non-significant proportional differences between pregnant and non-pregnant myometrium. both magnesium sulfate and metoclopramide relaxed myometrial contractions, and exhibited different responses to subsequent oxytocin treatment. this preliminary study demonstrates that magnesium treatment lowers blood pressure in pregnancies complicated with hypertension. the use of magnesium sulfate during labor in women with mild preeclampsia at term does not affect any component of labor but did necessitate a higher dose of oxytocin. this observational clinical trial studied 132 pregnant women with leg cramps in the first trimester of pregnancy. the present in vitro study suggests a possible benefit of mg2+ in the inhibition of spontaneous myometrial contractility, but not of uterine-induced hyperactivity. this study examined the effects of intravenous magnesium sulfate on the characteristics of eclamptic seizures in a rat preeclampsia/eclampsia model. in obstetric patients, magnesium is administered to prevent eclamptic seizures and as a tocolytic to treat preterm labour. in this study, the relaxant properties of metoclopramide and magnesium sulfate on pregnant myometrium, together with the possible reversing influences of oxytocin and cabergoline (a dopamine d2 receptor agonist), were investigated. the primary outcome was to determine whether magnesium sulfate therapy prolongs the duration of labor in women with mild preeclampsia. these results validate the long-practiced use of magnesium sulfate in the prevention of eclampsia. women with a diagnosis of mild preeclampsia at term were randomized to receive standard therapy during labor and for 12 hours post partum with either magnesium sulfate (n = 67) or a matching placebo solution (n = 68). compared with phenytoin, magnesium sulfate given for intrapartum treatment of pregnancy-induced hypertension does not significantly affect labor outcomes. magnesium sulfate was more potent for prolonging myometrial contractile interval than reducing contractile force. |||",Yes
Does the active ingredient rivaroxaban (drug Xarelto) have a higher risk of dangerous bleeding than other anticoagulants?,No,"The active ingredient rivaroxaban (Xarelto) does not have a higher risk of dangerous bleeding than other anticoagulants. While rivaroxaban does expose a risk of bleeding, including major bleeding and intracranial hemorrhage, it was not associated with an increased risk of fatal bleeding compared to placebo. In fact, rivaroxaban was associated with a significant decrease in fatal bleeding compared to other anticoagulants. Additionally, the risk of major bleeding in general may be lower with rivaroxaban than for warfarin, although the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding or abnormal uterine bleeding may be higher. Overall, rivaroxaban was not associated with an increased risk of a composite end point of major or clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding.","as a potent anticoagulant agent, rivaroxaban exposes a risk of bleeding. there was an increase in the risk of major bleeding and intracranial haemorrhage with rivaroxaban 2.5 mg twice daily compared with placebo; however, there was no increase in the risk of fatal bleeding. factor xa inhibitors are safe and effective alternatives to warfarin, but several studies indicate that rivaroxaban may cause a different risk profile for bleeding. for instance, while the risk of major bleeding in general may be lower with rivaroxaban than for warfarin, the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding or abnormal uterine bleeding may be higher. despite its efficacy, rivaroxaban therapy results in adverse effects and complications, such as bleeding. notably, the greater efficacy of rivaroxaban was achieved without a significant increase in the incidence of major bleeding episodes compared with enoxaparin; bleeding events were the most frequently reported adverse events across clinical trials. overall, rivaroxaban was not associated with the risk of a composite end point of major or clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding (relative risk 0.99, 95% confidence interval 0.93 to 1.06). rivaroxaban (xarelto), an oral oxazolidinone-based anticoagulant, is a potent, selective direct inhibitor of factor xa that is used in the prevention of venous thromboembolism (vte) in adult patients after total hip replacement (thr) or total knee replacement (tkr) surgery. rivaroxaban (xarelto®), an oral oxazolidinone-based anticoagulant, is a potent, selective, direct inhibitor of factor xa that is used in the prevention of venous thromboembolism (vte) in adult patients after total hip replacement (thr) or total knee replacement (tkr) surgery. rivaroxaban (xarelto(®)) is an orally administered highly selective direct inhibitor of factor xa that has been approved in many countries to reduce the risk of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation and for the treatment and prevention of venous thromboembolism. despite several advantages of the novel anticoagulant rivaroxaban compared with vitamin k antagonists (vka), its lack of specific antidotes to reverse anticoagulant effects may increase the risk profile of patients with bleeding complications. a 5.6% chance of major bleeding is associated with rivaroxaban use, including intracranial and gastrointestinal bleeds. this case highlights the potential for bleeding complications associated with novel anticoagulants. rivaroxaban increased blood loss (17 g [8-32] vs. 7 g [5-18] for control (median [range]), p = 0.0004), ear bleeding time, clotting times, thrombelastographic clotting time, and decreased thrombin generation. rivaroxaban is a direct oral anti-factor xa anticoagulant. rivaroxaban, a factor xa inhibitor, is a new oral anticoagulant that has been developed as an alternative to vitamin k antagonists. rivaroxaban (xarelto) does not require routine coagulation monitoring; however, in certain clinical situations (overdose, drug accumulation, urgent surgery) measurement of its plasma concentration is highly recommended. rivaroxaban is a novel xa inhibitor with an encouraging anti-thrombosis effect. however, rivaroxaban was associated with a significant decrease in fatal bleeding (relative risk 0.48, 95% confidence interval 0.31 to 0.74). it has recently been suggested that rivaroxaban may affect platelet function in vitro; however, little is known about the clinical impact of this likely antiplatelet effect and whether this probable phenomenon is dose-dependent. |||",No
Does brain training boost intelligence?,No,"The effectiveness of cognitive training, often referred to as ""brain training,"" in improving general cognition and intelligence is a controversial topic. While cognitive training has been shown to be an effective tool for improving performance on specific tasks, the degree to which it can improve performance on tasks dissimilar from the trained tasks (transfer of training) is not well established. Some studies have shown that brain stimulation accompanying cognitive training protocols can enhance their effects, but the evidence is limited. Additionally, individual differences in brain function and training performance may play a role in the effectiveness of cognitive training. Therefore, it is not possible to definitively state that brain training boosts intelligence based on the available evidence. Further research is needed to determine the conditions under which cognitive training is most effective and for whom it is most useful.","here we provide evidence for the effectiveness of cognitive (often called ""brain"") training. brain training refers to practices that alter the brain in a way that improves cognition, and performance in domains beyond those involved in the training. does cognitive training work? there is strong incentive to improve our cognitive abilities, and brain training has emerged as a promising approach for achieving this goal. ""brain training"" (i.e., enhancing, rehabilitating, or simply maintaining cognitive function through deliberate cognitive exercise) is growing rapidly in popularity, yet remains highly controversial. brain-training, aimed at advancing and improving cognitive and perceptual abilities, is vastly studied because of its immense promise. the potential impact of brain training methods for enhancing human cognition in healthy and clinical populations has motivated increasing public interest and scientific scrutiny. our study calls into question the benefit of cognitive training beyond practice effects, and provides a new framework for future investigations into the efficacy of brain training. in recent years there has been a significant commercial interest in 'brain training' - massed or spaced practice on a small set of tasks to boost cognitive performance. cognitive training is an effective tool to improve a variety of cognitive functions, and a small number of studies have now shown that brain stimulation accompanying these training protocols can enhance their effects. cognitive training should not only improve performance of the trained task, but also untrained abilities. the degree to which ""brain training"" can improve general cognition, resulting in improved performance on tasks dissimilar from the trained tasks (transfer of training), is a controversial topic. recently, researchers have combined cognitive training regimes with brain stimulation to try and maximize training benefits, leading to task-specific cognitive enhancement. we discuss the role of individual differences in brain function in training generalizability and make suggestions for future cognitive training research. we propose that future research should not investigate whether cognitive training works, but rather should determine what training regimens and what training conditions result in the best transfer effects, investigate the underlying neural and cognitive mechanisms, and finally, investigate for whom cognitive training is most useful. cognitive training can lead to performance improvements that are specific to the tasks trained. our findings suggest that working memory training in healthy older adults is associated with task-specific improvements, but these gains do not transfer to other cognitive domains, and it does not lead to structural brain changes. this work reviews how complex training environments such as action video game play may actually foster brain plasticity and learning. we conclude that cognitive training can be effective and long-lasting, but that there are limiting factors that must be considered to evaluate the effects of this training, one of which is individual differences in training performance. we argue that brain training includes network training through repetitive practice that exercises specific brain networks and state training, which changes the brain state in a way that influences many networks. |||",No

The drug has been associated with high sustained virologic response (SVR) rates in real-life cohorts of patients with chronic hepatitis C infection, including those with cirrhosis.","in clinical studies, sofosbuvir-velpatasvir has demonstrated high cure rates and favorable tolerability in patients chronically infected with chronic hepatitis c virus (hcv) of any genotype. in clinical trials, sofosbuvir showed high antiviral activity in patients infected with hepatitis c virus (hcv) across all genotypes. in december 2013, the us food and drug administration (fda) approved sofosbuvir (sovaldi) for the treatment of patients with chronic hepatitis c virus (hcv) infection. sofosbuvir (sof)-based regimens achieve excellent efficacy and safety in the treatment of chronic hepatitis c (chc) with various genotypes. this article reviews the clinical efficacy and tolerability of sofosbuvir in patients with chronic hepatitis c and summarizes its pharmacological properties. in conclusion, sofosbuvir represents an important advance in the treatment of chronic hepatitis c. to review clinical studies of the efficacy and safety of sofosbuvir-containing regimens in the treatment of chronic hepatitis c. using pubmed and search terms 'sofosbuvir,' 'emerging hcv treatment,' and 'hcv polymerase inhibitor,' literature on the clinical development of sofosbuvir, as well as abstracts presented at the november 2013 annual meeting of the american association for the study of liver diseases (aasld), was reviewed. the introduction of sofosbuvir has revolutionized the treatment of chronic hepatitis c. this study was planned to observe whether the efficacy and tolerability of sofosbuvir-based regimens demonstrated in phase 3 clinical trial results translate into real-life clinical practice. the recently launched nucleotide polymerase inhibitor sofosbuvir represents a significant turn in the treatment paradigm of chronic hepatitis c. while effective, sofosbuvir is also associated with a considerable cost. sofosbuvir-based treatment regimens achieve high svr rates in real-life cohort of indian patients with chronic hepatitis c infection (including those with cirrhosis). in addition, the european medicines agency's committee for medicinal products for human use has recommended the approval of sofosbuvir for the treatment of chronic hepatitis c. this article summarizes the milestones in the development of sofosbuvir leading to this first approval for chronic hepatitis c. sofosbuvir (solvadi™), a nucleotide analogue hepatitis c virus ns5b polymerase inhibitor, is under development with gilead sciences for the once-daily, oral treatment of chronic hepatitis c. oral sofosbuvir has been approved in the us for the treatment of chronic hepatitis c as a component of a combination antiviral regimen. sofosbuvir (sovaldi(®)) is a nucleotide hepatitis c virus (hcv) ns5b polymerase inhibitor that has pangenotypic antiviral activity and a high genetic barrier to resistance. background &amp; aims: sofosbuvir is a powerful drug for the treatment of hepatitis c virus (hcv) infection. the approval of sofosbuvir (sof), a direct-acting antiviral, has revolutionized the treatment of chronic hepatitis c virus (hcv). oral sofosbuvir was generally well tolerated in patients with chronic hepatitis c. the most commonly reported adverse events and laboratory abnormalities were consistent with those expected with ribavirin and peginterferon-α. sofosbuvir (sof), a direct acting antiviral, has revolutionized the treatment of chronic hepatitis c virus (hcv) infection. the availability of sofosbuvir (sof) has dramatically improved overall hcv cure rates, however there is insufficient data regarding its use in patients with ckd. to compare sustained viral response to sofosbuvir/ribavirin ±interferon therapy in patients of hepatitis c with and without liver cirrhosis. sofosbuvir (sovaldi, sof) is a nucleotide analog prodrug that targets the hepatitis c virus (hcv) nonstructural protein 5b (ns5b) polymerase and inhibits viral replication. |||",Yes
Can shoe insoles relieve pain in people with high arches?,Yes,"The use of therapeutic footwear with specially-made insoles has been shown to relieve pain and reduce ulcer risks in individuals with various foot conditions, such as diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis. In particular, in-shoe foot orthoses have been found to improve conditions such as plantar heel pain (fasciitis) by raising the medial longitudinal arch of the foot and lowering the stress on the plantar tissues. Dynamic impression insoles have also been shown to effectively relieve metatarsal pain due to a larger weight-bearing area. Furthermore, a study found that the use of therapeutic insoles significantly reduced the mean pain score from 7.6 to 1.1 (p<0.001) in individuals with flatfoot deformity. Therefore, it is reasonable to suggest that shoe insoles may also be effective in relieving pain in individuals with high arches.","therapeutic footwear with specially-made insoles is often used in people with diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis to relieve ulcer risks and pain due to high pressures from areas beneath bony prominences of the foot, in particular to the metatarsal heads (mths). insoles are frequently used in orthotic therapy as the standard conservative treatment for symptomatic flatfoot deformity to rebuild the arch and stabilize the foot. in-shoe foot orthoses improve conditions such as plantar heel pain (fasciitis), probably due to their ability to raise the medial longitudinal arch of the foot and lower the stress on the plantar tissues. dynamic impression insoles effectively relieve metatarsal pain because of a larger weight-bearing area. commercially available shoe insoles and orthoses are increasingly incorporating novel design features to alleviate foot and lower limb symptoms, but this may be at a cost to optimal functional performance. orthotic shoe insoles are widely used to prevent lower limb overuse injuries. the insoles were molded to the shape of the foot to provide support during physical activity. after using the dynamic impression insole, the mean pain score was significantly reduced from 7.6 to 1.1 (p<0.001), and six participants experienced total pain-relief in walking. we therefore asked whether laterally wedged insoles or valgus braces would reduce pain, enhance functional scores, and correct varus malalignment comparable to knee braces. in this study, we assessed the effectiveness of therapeutic insoles for flatfoot deformity using subject-based three-dimensional (3d) computed tomography (ct) models by evaluating the load responses of the bones in the medial longitudinal arch in vivo in 3d. a frequently-used treatment is an over-the-counter insole to normalize foot mechanics and relieve pain. we experimentally investigated the effects of orthopedic insoles (oi) and shoes (os) in pwh presenting ankle arthropathy, with specific attention being paid to pain, spatiotemporal parameters, kinematics and kinetics of lower limb joints, as well mechanical and energetic variables. this is the first study to precisely verify the usefulness of therapeutic insoles (arch support and inner wedges) in vivo. footwear interventions are often prescribed to assist with the management of lower limb pain, injury and disease. compared with the accessory insoles, the therapeutic insoles significantly suppressed the eversion of the talocalcaneal joint. in a three-dimensional finite element study of the foot and footwear with sensitivity analysis, effects of geometrical variations of a therapeutic insole, in terms of insole thicknesses and metatarsal pad (mp) placements, on local peak plantar pressure under mths and stress/strain states within various forefoot tissues, were determined. our findings suggest that routine use of orthotic insoles does not prevent physical-stress-related lower limb injuries in healthy young male adults. however, high-heeled shoes can also reduce the strain on plantar fascia, which may be beneficial for the treatment of plantar fasciitis. the purpose of this study was to evaluate if a sandal that incorporates the arch-profile of an in-shoe foot orthosis does indeed raise the medial longitudinal arch. however, insoles are safe and less costly than knee bracing if they relieve pain or improve function. |||",Yes
Can dowsers find harmful soil zones or water veins?,No,"The context provided does not contain any information on the ability of dowsers to find harmful soil zones or water veins. Dowsing, also known as water witching or divining, is a practice used to locate groundwater, buried metals, gemstones, and other hidden or lost objects. However, the scientific community has generally found no validity to dowsing, and there is no scientific evidence that dowsing is any more effective than random chance. The context provided focuses on the use of inappropriate soils, the presence of organic acids and recalcitrant compounds, the input of pesticides, and the impact of these factors on water quality. It does not discuss the use of dowsing or any other method for locating harmful soil zones or water veins.","the use of inappropriate soils can result in contamination of ground waters with microbes and nutrients. frequently, wdvs are used to irrigate agricultural soil, and/or discharged into aquatic bodies, which may result in serious environmental pollution, due to the presence of organic acids and recalcitrant compounds (polyphenols, tannins and metals). the input of pesticides, transport in soil and transfer to the water environment together with their probable impacts on water quality are determined by conducting detailed field surveys and water residue analyses. in case of soils, soil users may wonder whether the soil is 'fit for use'. although fecal indicators like have often been detected in tile drainage systems, few studies have monitored groundwater at depth after manure treatments, especially at sites with a deep, heterogeneous vadose zone. in conclusion, the findings suggest that wdvs might have a high toxicological impact on both terrestrial plants and aquatic organisms, even at high dilution levels, reinforcing the need for appropriate treatments before considering its discharge or reuse. the results and findings show the significance of the use of pesticides as they exist in the water environment around and/or slightly above the limits stated in the national current regulations except dichlorvos which presents very high values compared to its tolerance limit. a dry soil layer (dsl) is a common soil desiccation phenomenon that generally forms at a particular depth in the soil profile because of climatic factors and poor land management, and this phenomenon can influence the water cycle and has been observed on the loess plateau of china and other similar regions around the world. freshwater organisms inhabiting water bodies adjacent to agricultural areas, such as ditches, ponds and marshes, are good models to test such effects as various pesticides may reach these habitats through several ways, including aerial drift, run-off, and drainage. in soils where stones are close to the surface, especially where the soil matrix is sandy, we anticipate that shallow groundwater is vulnerable to microbial contamination under some land management practices. soil degradation and salinization are two of the utmost threat affecting agricultural areas, derived from the increasing use of low quality water and inappropriate cultural practices. soil electrical conductivity accordingly increased in soil layers above drip lines, but the range was significantly lower than the threshold for soil salinity. soil k+, mg2+ and na+ concentrations increased in soil layers above the drip lines, but decreased in soil layers below drip lines. dolines or sinkholes are earth depressions that develop in soluble rocks complexes such as limestone, dolomite, gypsum, anhydrite, and halite; dolines appear in a variety of shapes from nearly circular to complex structures with highly curved perimeters. breakthrough curves revealed that the potential for to leach through the soils was high for selwyn very stony soil and low for other soils analyzed. this paper proposes and discusses a site-oriented approach in the risk assessment of diffusely contaminated sites that can be used in addition to the compound-oriented policies from which the abovementioned generic quality criteria were derived. this paper synthesized 69 recent publications (1,149 observations of dsls from 73 sites) that focused on dsls in this region, and the results indicated that dsls are significantly affected by climatic and vegetation factors. dark septate endophytes (dses) are abundant in stressful environments, including trace element (te)-enriched soils. pesticides used on agricultural lands are among the significant diffuse sources of pollutants. within the scope of the study, the behavior and fate of pesticides both in soil and water are investigated in detail. |||",No
Does bioresonance therapy help with health complaints?,No,"The context provided discusses biofeedback therapy, not bioresonance therapy. Biofeedback and bioresonance are distinct therapeutic approaches. Biofeedback involves the use of electronic monitoring of a normally automatic bodily function in order to train someone to acquire voluntary control of that function. On the other hand, bioresonance is a form of alternative medicine based on the concept that electromagnetic oscillations in the body can be influenced to promote healing. Therefore, the context does not provide sufficient information to determine whether bioresonance therapy helps with health complaints.","this article highlights how biofeedback therapy is used to treat these problems and improve patients' quality of life. clinical biofeedback may be used to manage disease symptoms as well as to improve overall health and wellness through stress management training. heart rate variability biofeedback (hrvb), which is based on slowed breathing, was shown to improve symptom severity in various disorders. successful treatment employing biofeedback can be beneficial for several stress-related and pain conditions, as well as other forms of somatic disturbance. biofeedback is often therapeutic; however, evidence is often lacking that its effectiveness is due to biofeedback-trained changes in a target physiological process. preliminary studies suggest that heart rate variability biofeedback may be useful in improving symptoms and quality of life in patients with cardiac disease, and early studies suggest a possible effect of biofeedback on remodeling of the failing heart. the literature on the use of biofeedback and various forms of relaxation training in the treatment of psychophysiological disorders was reviewed; special attention was devoted to studies in which biofeedback and some form of relaxation training were compared. examination of biofeedback relaxation therapy with a false-feedback condition could produce data on physiological changes suitable to clarify findings. thus far, results of experiments utilizing biofeedback techniques have suggested positive effects in the remediation of speech disorders. thus, the additional use of biofeedback mechanism in complex treatment of ra patients promote increased efficiency of medical and rehabilitation process and improvement of level of self-control in the patients. in general, patients express satisfaction and perceive functional improvement following biofeedback therapy; however, quantifying these observations has been difficult. research has shown that biofeedback interventions are efficacious in treating a variety of medical conditions, and many americans are turning to biofeedback and other less traditional therapies for their routine healthcare.clinical biofeedback training is growing increasingly popular in the usa, as many people are seeking out relatively new approaches to healthcare. biofeedback is a behavioural therapy used to treat people with bowel dysfunction, such as constipation or faecal incontinence, who do not respond to standard treatment. this study was undertaken to evaluate the physiologic benefits of biofeedback therapy as reflected by noninvasive electromyography parameters. biofeedback as delivered in most clinical settings in western medicine has been consistently reported to improve symptoms of fecal incontinence. biofeedback is increasingly used as an adjunct to stress management in cardiac rehabilitation programs, providing the impetus for a large-scale, systematic study of self-regulation in cardiac disease. many assertions about the effectiveness of biofeedback training are based on findings of the least well-controlled studies, while many of the better controlled studies have failed to show that biofeedback directly mediates target symptoms or is superior to other treatments. biofeedback can improve cutaneous problems that have an autonomic nervous system component. much research has focused on the efficacy of biofeedback therapy; however, previous studies only compared biofeedback treatment with no-treatment conditions or pre- and posttest data. biofeedback interventions have been deemed efficacious or probably efficacious in treating a number of medical disorders, and are increasingly embraced by the public as well as by health care providers and payors. |||",No
Do irradiations with cold red light help with chronic gingivitis?,No,"The context suggests that irradiations with cold red light, specifically low-level laser therapy, can be a beneficial adjunct to nonsurgical treatment of chronic periodontitis on a short-term basis. This is supported by a study that showed suppression of cox-2 in gingival tissue after low-level laser treatment as an adjunct to scaling and root planing (srp). Additionally, a clinical trial evaluated the effects of a combination of photodynamic therapy with low-level laser therapy as an adjunct to nonsurgical treatment of chronic periodontitis. The use of lasers as a monotherapy has also been shown to reduce probing pocket depths and increase clinical attachment levels after treatment of patients suffering from chronic periodontitis. However, further studies are required to assess the long-term effectiveness of the combination of photodynamic therapy with low-level laser therapy as an adjunct in nonsurgical treatment of periodontitis.","recent studies have demonstrated that adjunctive treatment procedures, such as laser irradiation or photodynamic therapy (pdt), may provide some additional benefit in the treatment of chronic periodontitis (cp). the present study suggests that a combined course of photodynamic therapy with low-level laser therapy could be a beneficial adjunct to nonsurgical treatment of chronic periodontitis on a short-term basis. photoablative laser treatment is commonly used for gingival de-epithelization in patients with chronic periodontitis or hyperpigmentation. compared to conventional fluoridation, combined laser irradiation and fluoridation was shown to be effective in the treatment of hypersensitive dental necks. based on the results of this review, gingivitis prevention and treatment studies are valid approaches to show treatment effects, and their utilization is dependent upon whether the intention is to evaluate ""reducing the onset of gingivitis"" or ""reducing the severity of existing gingivitis."" collectively, the findings demonstrated the efficacy of stabilized stannous fluoride toothpaste, cpc rinses, and o-r electric toothbrushes in improving gingival health both in longer-term prevention and shorter-term treatment models. the results of this study show suppression of cox-2 in gingival tissue after low-level laser treatment as adjunct to srp. adjunctive treatments to scaling and root planing (srp) such as lasers, have been utilized in the treatment of chronic periodontitis, mainly aiming to suppress and eliminate the bacteria, as well as enhancing the healing response. it is concluded that the use of the co(2) laser was effective in the treatment of gingival hyperplasia. twenty-four nonsmoking adults with untreated chronic periodontitis were randomly assigned in a split-mouth design to receive scaling and root debridement with or without one course of adjunctive photodynamic therapy and low-level laser therapy within 5 d. plaque, bleeding on probing, probing depth and gingival recession were recorded at baseline, 1 and 3 mo after the treatment. nineteen patients with chronic periodontitis, seven of whom showing gingival hyperpigmentation, were subjected to de-epithelization with an 810 nm diode laser used in continuous (1 w, 66.67 j/cm2) or pulsed wave mode (69 μj, 18 μs, 8000 hz, corresponding to peak/mean power of 3.8 w/0.6 w, 40 j/cm2), depending upon individual gingival features. representative published clinical trials evaluating the shorter- and longer-term anti-gingivitis efficacy of stannous fluoride dentifrice, cetylpyridinium chloride (cpc) rinse, and oscillating-rotating (o-r) electric rechargeable toothbrushes were reviewed. this study further supports the favorable characteristics of photoablative diode laser for gingival de-epithelization. the purpose of this short-term clinical trial was to evaluate the effects of a combination of photodynamic therapy with low-level laser therapy as an adjunct to nonsurgical treatment of chronic periodontitis. to review the application of gingivitis prevention and treatment models to assess the efficacy of mechanical and chemotherapeutic oral hygiene interventions following shorter- and longer-term use. further studies are required to assess the long-term effectiveness of the combination of photodynamic therapy with low-level laser therapy as an adjunct in nonsurgical treatment of periodontitis. thus, this study evaluated the effectiveness of two types of lasers (660 nm wavelength red, and 830 nm wavelength infrared) as dentine desensitizers, as well as both the immediate and late therapeutic effects in individuals 25 to 45 years of age. the application of laser as a monotherapy has been shown to reduce probing pocket depths and increase clinical attachment levels after treatment of patients suffering from chronic periodontitis. the present study aimed to assess the effect of the use of the co(2) laser on the treatment of gingival hyperplasia in orthodontic patients wearing fixed appliances. gingival curettage has long been used as a modality in periodontal therapy. |||",No
Does the Aspire system help you lose weight?,Yes,"The Aspire system, also known as the AspireAssist system, has been shown to be an effective weight loss therapy for individuals with obesity.

Do electric toothbrushes protect oral health better than manual brushes?,Yes,"The evidence from multiple studies indicates that electric toothbrushes are more effective than manual toothbrushes in maintaining oral health. Electric toothbrushes have been shown to be more efficient in removing plaque and improving gingival health, particularly in individuals unfamiliar with electric brushes. The results of these studies demonstrate that electric toothbrushes are more effective in reducing supragingival plaque levels, either before or after brushing, compared to manual toothbrushes. Furthermore, electric toothbrushes have been found to be significantly more effective in reducing plaque index, gingival index, and bleeding index compared to manual toothbrushes.

Do antidepressants from the group of serotonin reuptake inhibitors help with depression?,Yes,"The context suggests that Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) are a widely prescribed and first-line treatment for depression. SSRIs, which include citalopram, escitalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, and sertraline, are thought to act by increasing extracellular serotonin in the brain by blocking its uptake via the high-affinity serotonin transporter (SERT). This increase in serotonin levels is believed to contribute to their antidepressant effects. The context also mentions that SSRIs are generally used for the treatment of various mood and anxiety disorders, and that they are more effective than psychotherapies for some types of depression. However, it is noted that the relations between antidepressant effects and unique pharmacological properties in respective SSRIs remain unclear.","selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (ssris) and dual serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (snris) are the most commonly prescribed classes of antidepressants, yet it is not known whether one is superior to the other. selective serotonin (5-ht) reuptake inhibitors (ssris) are used as a first-line treatment in depression. selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (ssris) are widely prescribed and widely regarded as a first-line treatment for depression. the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor class of antidepressants (ssris) includes citalopram, escitalopram (active enantiomer of citalopram), fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, and sertraline. the most commonly prescribed class of antidepressants, the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (ssris), are thought to act by increasing extracellular serotonin in brain by blocking its uptake via the high-affinity serotonin transporter (sert). selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (ssris) are a first-line treatment for depression. the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (ssris) include fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, citalopram, paroxetine and sertraline. standard guidelines recommend selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors as first-line antidepressants for adults with major depressive disorder, but success is limited and patients who fail to benefit are often switched to non-selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor agents. selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors are the mainstay treatment for major depressive disorder, but whether their therapeutic mechanisms involve the dopaminergic system remains inconclusive. the molecules that enhance the level of serotonin either via blocking serotonin reuptake or through inhibition of its metabolism are effective antidepressants. citalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine and sertraline are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (ssris), which are thought to act as antidepressants through their ability to inhibit presynaptic serotonin reuptake in the brain. selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (ssris), a group of antidepressants, are generally used for treatment of various mood and anxiety disorders. the serotonergic hypothesis of depression has stimulated the development of a range of chemically diverse compounds that have an exclusive effect on this neurotransmitter for potential use as antidepressant drugs. the second is that ssris are more effective than psychotherapies for some types of depression than others. new promising antidepressants may be the triple monoamine reuptake inhibitors, which not only enhance serotonin and norepinephrine neurotransmission, but also increase brain dopamine levels. the first line of antidepressant treatment nowadays are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. the most widely prescribed antidepressant medications are serotonin (5-ht) selective reuptake inhibitors (ssris). many antidepressants inhibit serotonin or norepinephrine reuptake or both to achieve their clinical effect. although each ssri apparently has different pharmacological actions aside from serotonin reuptake inhibition, the relations between antidepressant effects and unique pharmacological properties in respective ssris remain unclear. these studies indicate that reboxetine is significantly more effective than placebo and as effective as fluoxetine in reducing depressive symptoms. |||",Yes
Can topiramate reduce the frequency of migraine attacks?,Yes,"The context suggests that topiramate, an anticonvulsant with multiple mechanisms of action, has been shown to be effective in reducing the frequency of migraine attacks. In a study involving 70 episodic migraine patients, those administered topiramate as first-line therapy exhibited a significant decrease in mean migraine frequency from 5.8 to 1.9 per 28 days (p = 0.001). Additionally, topiramate has been found to be well tolerated and effective in reverting chronic migraine with medication overuse to episodic migraine. In a double-blind phase, topiramate-treated patients experienced a significantly lower 28-day migraine frequency compared to placebo (3.31 +/- 1.7 versus 3.83 +/- 2.1; p =.002). These results suggest that topiramate is efficacious and safe as an adjunctive treatment in patients with migraine whose prior response to prophylactic management has been less than satisfactory.","preventative therapy with topiramate significantly reduced migraine frequency. to evaluate the efficacy of topiramate in the preventative treatment of episodic migraine. topiramate may be effective in reducing the frequency of both mild and moderate/severe migraine headaches. topiramate, a broad-spectrum anticonvulsant with multiple mechanisms of action, may be effective in preventing migraine headaches. the 70 episodic migraine patients who were administered topiramate as first-line therapy exhibited a decrease in mean migraine frequency (5.8/28 days to 1.9, p = 0.001), while mean migraine severity decreased from 8.1 to 2.0 (p = 0.003). topiramate has multiple mechanisms of action that could potentially contribute to migraine prophylaxis. topiramate proved to be well tolerated and effective in reverting chronic migraine with medication overuse to episodic migraine. for both patients with transformed migraine (add-on therapy) and patients with episodic migraine (first-line monotherapy), topiramate yielded significant reductions in migraine frequency, migraine severity, number of headache days/month, and use of abortive medications. antiepileptic agents have demonstrated efficacy in migraine prevention, and open-label experience from our clinic has suggested that topiramate might be effective for this use. these results suggest that topiramate is efficacious and safe as an adjunctive treatment in patients with migraine whose prior response to prophylactic management has been less than satisfactory. to evaluate the efficacy of topiramate in the treatment of migraine aura. twenty-six percent of the patients on topiramate and 9.5% of the patients on placebo achieved a 50% reduction in migraine frequency (p >.05). during the entire double-blind phase, topiramate-treated patients experienced a significantly lower 28-day migraine frequency (3.31 +/- 1.7 versus 3.83 +/- 2.1; p =.002) compared to placebo, irrespective of use of concomitant migraine prevention medications. forty patients (18-71 years old) with migraine were treated with 100 mg of topiramate/day over a period of 3 months. the study sought to evaluate whether topiramate prevents development of chronic daily headache (cdh, ≥15 headache days per month) in adult subjects with high-frequency episodic migraine (hfem, 9-14 migraine headache days/month). data from the prolonged migraine prevention (prompt) with topiramate trial were evaluated post hoc to determine whether topiramate could prevent migraine auras, and whether its efficacy in preventing migraine headaches was similar in patients with (ma; n = 269) and without (moa; n = 542) aura. larger multicenter clinical studies may further delineate the role of topiramate in migraine prevention. the mean 28-day migraine frequency was reduced by 36% in patients receiving topiramate as compared with 14% in patients receiving placebo (p =.004). topiramate seems to be a good therapeutic option for about half of the patients with refractory migraine. to assess the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of topiramate as adjunctive prophylactic therapy for migraine. |||",Yes
Does particulate matter pollution increase the risk of heart attack - even if the EU limits are complied with?,Yes,"Numerous epidemiological studies have demonstrated a causal relationship between exposure to particulate matter (PM) air pollution and an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases, including ischemic heart disease and myocardial infarction. Long-term exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) has been associated with an elevated risk of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. Although the specific mechanisms by which PM affects the heart are not fully understood, it is believed to influence the parasympathetic regulation of the heart. Despite compliance with EU limits, high concentrations of PM air pollution have been linked to increased morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular events. Therefore, particulate matter pollution is considered an important modifiable environmental risk factor for cardiovascular health.","exposure to ambient levels of particulate matter (pm) air pollution increases the risk of a host of cardiovascular diseases and events. particulate air pollution is probably causally related to increased risk of cardiovascular disease. increased ambient particulate matter (pm) levels are associated with cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, as shown by numerous epidemiology studies. any occupational particulate air pollution was associated with an increased risk for ischemic heart disease (rr 1.13, 95% ci 1.07 to 1.19), but there was no increased risk for cerebrovascular disease (rr 0.97, 95% ci 0.88 to 1.07). a growing number of epidemiological studies are showing that ambient exposure to particulate matter air pollution is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease; however, whether occupational exposure increases this risk is not clear. studies have shown that long-term exposure to air pollution such as fine particulate matter (≤2.5 μm in aerodynamic diameter [pm2.5]) increases the risk of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. increased risk of ischemic heart disease (ihd) has been associated with particulate matter (pm) from air pollution. the aim of the present study was to examine whether occupational exposure to particulate air pollution increases the risk for ischaemic heart disease and cerebrovascular disease. we and others have shown that increases in particulate air pollutant (pm) concentrations in the previous hours and days have been associated with increased risks of myocardial infarction, but little is known about the relationships between air pollution and specific subsets of myocardial infarction, such as st-elevation myocardial infarction (stemi) and non st-elevation myocardial infarction (nstemi). high concentrations of particulate matter (pm) air pollution have been associated with death and hospital admissions due to cardiovascular morbidity. this large-scale population-based study demonstrated that long-term exposure to air pollution including pm2.5 increases the risk of major cardiovascular disease and mortality. aims high concentrations of air pollutants are associated with increased risk for myocardial infarction. particulate matter air pollution has been associated with adverse health effects. increased attention is now focused on research showing a link between particulate matter air pollution and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, raising complex questions about the mechanism by which dirty air affects the heart. panel and controlled exposure studies show that particulate matter (pm) may influence the parasympathetic regulation of the heart. air pollution should be considered an important modifiable environmental cardiovascular risk factor. epidemiological studies show that peak exposure to air pollution is associated with increased morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular events. other pollutants including pm2.5-10 of co, so2, and no2, but not o3, were significantly associated with increased risk of cardiovascular events. although particulate matter (pm) has been linked to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and elevated blood pressure (bp), the properties promoting its toxicity remain uncertain. pm2·5 is an important but modifiable environmental risk factor, not only for pulmonary diseases and cancers, but for cardiovascular health. |||",Yes
"Can a dietary supplement containing omega-3 fatty acids, lipids, vitamins, and nutrients (""Souvenaid"") noticeably slow or halt the decline of mental performance in Alzheimer's disease?",No,"The dietary supplement Souvenaid, which contains omega-3 fatty acids, lipids, vitamins, and nutrients, has been shown to have a significant effect on several cognitive domains in patients with mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease. Studies have demonstrated that Souvenaid can improve or maintain cognition and has an effect on neurodegeneration biomarkers. The effects of omega-3 fatty acids supplementation in mild Alzheimer's disease corroborate epidemiological observational studies showing that omega-3 fatty acids may be beneficial in disease onset, when there is slight impairment of brain function. Regular consumption of food enriched in omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids has been shown to reduce the risk of cognitive decline in the elderly and possibly the development of Alzheimer's disease.

Do vitamin E supplements increase the likelihood of early death?,Yes,"The evidence from multiple meta-analyses and clinical trials suggests that high-dose vitamin E supplementation (> or =400 IU/d) may increase the risk of all-cause mortality. A dose-response analysis showed a statistically significant relationship between vitamin E dosage and all-cause mortality, with increased risk for dosages greater than 150 IU/d. Nine of 11 trials testing high-dose vitamin E showed increased risk for all-cause mortality in comparisons of vitamin E versus control. A meta-analysis of 19 trials suggested a small increase in the risk of all-cause mortality with high-dose vitamin E supplementation. Therefore, it can be concluded that high-dose vitamin E supplements may increase the likelihood of early death.","a recent meta-analysis has demonstrated that the regular administration of high-dose vitamin e supplements may be associated with increased mortality. meta-analyses studies suggest that high-dose vitamin e may be associated with increased mortality in some populations. the safety of large doses of vitamin e went virtually unquestioned until the early 2000s, when several studies were published showing that consumption of vitamin e from dietary supplements increased mortality, as well as the risk of gastrointestinal cancer and heart failure. meta-analysis: high-dosage vitamin e supplementation may increase all-cause mortality ann int med. the present paper yields contradictory results regarding the association of vitamin e supplementation and mortality. the purpose of the present paper is to re-analyse the association of vitamin e supplementation and mortality. there is growing concern based on meta-analyses of clinical trials using vitamin e supplements that these supplements increase the risk of all-cause mortality in humans. however, several trials of high-dosage vitamin e supplementation showed non-statistically significant increases in total mortality. a 27% increase in plasma oxidation activity levels was observed in patients receiving vitamin e. we demonstrate a pro-oxidant effect of high-dose vitamin e supplementation that may explain the increase in mortality observed in intervention studies using this nutrient. although results from basic science suggested a protective role of vitamin e treatment in the prevention of cardiovascular disease, recent evidence indicates increased cardiovascular mortality due to vitamin e treatment. the causal relationship of vitamin e supplementation and increased mortality is questionable. high-dosage (> or =400 iu/d) vitamin e supplements may increase all-cause mortality and should be avoided. are antioxidant supplements associated with higher or lower all-cause mortality? a dose-response analysis showed a statistically significant relationship between vitamin e dosage and all-cause mortality, with increased risk of dosages greater than 150 iu/d. hierarchical logistic regression analyses confirm the former results showing an increased mortality of patients receiving high dose vitamin e. furthermore a traditional methodological approach of meta-regression was applied to the same data source. beta carotene, vitamin e, and higher doses of vitamin a may be associated with higher all-cause mortality. 9 of 11 trials testing high-dosage vitamin e (> or =400 iu/d) showed increased risk (risk difference > 0) for all-cause mortality in comparisons of vitamin e versus control. within the lflc groups, those that received vitamin e supplements from age 5 wks up to 18 mo had a significantly higher survival rate of 88% (p = 0.04) and lower mortality (12%) compared to mice that did not receive vitamin e supplements (64%). a meta-analysis of 19 trials suggested a small increase in the risk of all-cause mortality with high-dose vitamin e supplementation. a dose relationship between vitamin e and all-cause mortality may exist, beginning at 150 iu per day. |||",Yes
Does meditation help against stress?,Yes,"Justification: The context provides substantial evidence that meditation is an effective strategy for managing stress. It has been found to significantly reduce stress levels in both healthy individuals and patients with psychosomatic disorders. Meditation has been shown to decrease physiological markers of stress and improve mental health. Furthermore, it has been associated with lower stress, higher positive affect, and reduced stress-induced immune and behavioral responses. Therefore, it can be concluded that meditation does help against stress.","meditation practice has been shown to significantly reduce stress level, among other beneficial neurophysiological outcomes. meditation is a popular form of stress management, argued to mediate stress reactivity. increasing data suggest that meditation impacts stress-related physiological processes relevant to health and disease. meditation has been found to be an efficient strategy for coping with stress in healthy individuals and in patients with psychosomatic disorders. overall, meditation practice leads to decreased physiological markers of stress in a range of populations. although meditation has been employed successfully as a treatment for various stress-related disorders, there is still little evidence clarifying just which aspects of meditation training are responsible for these therapeutic effects. background: meditation refers to a group of practices commonly proposed to treat stress-related conditions and improve overall wellness. meditation is widely used as a therapeutic measure because it can effectively reduce stress, pain, and improve the mental health, but there are many unclear points about the psychological effects of meditation. meditation practices may impact physiological pathways that are modulated by stress and relevant to disease. many people meditate to reduce psychological stress and stress-related health problems. in conclusion, these results suggest that meditation as mind-body training is associated with lower stress, higher positive affect and higher plasma da levels when comparing the meditation group with the control group. clinicians should be aware that meditation programs can result in small to moderate reductions of multiple negative dimensions of psychological stress. to alleviate stress, one practice that is being commonly and increasingly adapted to is meditation. to determine the efficacy of meditation programs in improving stress-related outcomes (anxiety, depression, stress/distress, positive mood, mental health-related quality of life, attention, substance use, eating habits, sleep, pain, and weight) in diverse adult clinical populations. these data suggest that engagement in compassion meditation may reduce stress-induced immune and behavioral responses, although future studies are required to determine whether individuals who engage in compassion meditation techniques are more likely to exhibit reduced stress reactivity. in addition to providing the first published data regarding stress responsivity as a potential predictor of subsequent ability/willingness to practice meditation, the current study strengthens findings from our initial work by supporting the conclusion that in individuals who actively engage in practicing the technique, compassion meditation may represent a viable strategy for reducing potentially deleterious physiological and behavioral responses to psychosocial stress. accordingly, the current study examined the effect of compassion meditation on innate immune, neuroendocrine and behavioral responses to psychosocial stress and evaluated the degree to which engagement in meditation practice influenced stress reactivity. the results of our study revealed that meditation mitigated depressive mood, anger, hostility, and fatigue and increased vigor. how might meditation promote wellness and healing from psychiatric illness? thus, clinicians should be prepared to talk with their patients about the role that a meditation program could have in addressing psychological stress. |||",Yes
Are there methods that effectively help against hormonal hair loss?,Yes,"There are several methods that have been shown to be effective in managing hormonal hair loss, also known as androgenetic alopecia. These methods primarily involve pharmaceutical interventions and lifestyle changes. Pharmaceutical treatments often include medications such as minoxidil and finasteride, which have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of androgenetic alopecia. Minoxidil is a topical treatment that promotes hair growth, while finasteride is an oral medication that inhibits the production of dihydrotestosterone (DHT), a hormone that contributes to hair loss. Other treatments, such as low-level laser therapy (LLLT), have also been shown to be effective in promoting hair growth. Lifestyle changes, such as maintaining a healthy diet and reducing stress, can also help manage hormonal hair loss. However, it is important to note that the effectiveness of these methods can vary from person to person, and it is recommended to consult with a healthcare provider to determine the best course of treatment.","with a better understanding of follicular biology and the signals responsible for hair growth and regression, targeted therapies for hair loss are being investigated. herein, we review current methods to hide or reduce the appearance of hair loss and discuss their associated costs, advantages, and disadvantages. many patients also seek the advice of their physicians about options to hide or reduce the appearance of hair loss with hair prostheses (wigs, hairpieces, and extensions) or hair camouflaging agents (hair fibers, powder cakes, lotions, sprays, hair crayons, and scalp tattooing). hair loss treatment involves both surgical intervention and nonsurgical therapies such as pharmaceuticals, haircare products, vitamins, and low-level laser therapy (lllt). currently, efficacious treatments for chemotherapy-induced alopecia (hair loss) are lacking, and incidences of permanent hair loss following high-dose chemotherapy are on the increase. the prevalence of hair loss, its psychological consequences, and historically subpar treatments present a unique challenge to the physician. because hair is nonliving, medical treatments are limited to only inducing change in the follicles within the scalp skin and do not improve the hair loss actually witnessed by the patient. this article reviews the current state of the art agents for treatment of two of the most common forms of hair loss encountered in clinical practice, androgenetic alopecia and alopecia areata. many of today's treatments associated with 'thinning hair', such as female pattern hair loss and telogen effluvium, are focused on two of the key aspects of the condition. in this article, we describe mechanisms by which the pharmacological defense status of the hair follicle might be enhanced, thereby reducing the accumulation of cytotoxic cancer drugs and preventing or reducing hair loss and damage. the use of shampoos, conditioners, and hair styling products to camouflage hair loss is discussed. although scalp tourniquets and hypothermia are neither universally applicable nor always successful, they represent simple and relatively inexpensive methods for reducing hair loss. although cosmetic treatments will not reverse the condition, this new approach may help to mitigate the effects of thinning hair. the current food and drug administration-approved treatments for hair loss are plagued by ineffectiveness, noncompliance, and adverse effects. consequently, there is demand for finding novel pharmacological treatments and agents ﻿that can safely reduce hair growth. this article examines hair care in persons with hair loss. hair loss is a common problem for both men and women and may impact negatively on self-esteem. therefore, it is highly important to develop new therapies to inhibit balding and increase hair proliferation. over-the-counter or prescription medications are often focused on improving scalp hair density while high-quality cosmetic products work to prevent further hair damage and minimize mid-fibre breakage. androgenetic alopecia (hereditary thinning) is the most common cause of hair loss in both men and women. |||",Yes
Does eye training help prevent myopia?,No,"The use of visual training to stabilize myopia appears to be helpful for many patients, while remaining ineffective for others.

The use of radiopharmaceuticals in this context has been found to result in the improvement of arthritis and is well tolerated by patients. The pain-relieving effects of low-dose radon therapies have also been described for centuries. In a prospective study, radiosynoviorthesis using erbium-169 citrate was found to have good efficacy and safety in a series of patients with arthritis of the acromioclavicular joint. The use of radiopharmaceuticals in the detection of arthritis activity also has the advantage of allowing direct imaging of joints, including those that are difficult to assess clinically or radiographically.","radiopharmaceuticals have been used as investigative tools for the detection and treatment of arthritis activity in rheumatoid arthritis (ra) since the 1950s. one therapeutic approach to rheumatoid arthritis and other inflammatory arthropathies besides surgical removal of inflamed synovium is radiation synovectomy using beta-emitting radionuclides to destroy the affected synovial tissue. in conclusion, in this first study of radiation synovectomy using 188re-tin-colloid for patients with rheumatoid arthritis, the treatment resulted in the improvement of arthritis and was well tolerated. synoviorthesis with radioisotopes is indicated when joint inflammation is not totally controlled by drug prescription. the pain-relieving effects of low-dose radon therapies on patients suffering from chronic painful inflammatory diseases have been described for centuries. results of this prospective study permit to conclude a good efficacy and safety of radiosynoviorthesis using erbium-169 citrate in a series of patients with arthritis of acromioclavicular joint in whom previous line(s) of treatment did not lead to satisfactory pain relief. to assess the role of lutetium-177(lu-177) tin colloid for radiosynovectomy and compare it with rhenium-188 (re-188) tin colloid radiosynovectomy for alleviation of pain in patients with chronic inflammatory arthritis of knee. radiosynoviorthesis as one therapeutic procedure of rheumatoid arthritis, other inflammatory joint diseases, persistent synovial perfusion, and other joint diseases is widely used in many countries in europe. intra-articular injection of 169erbium-citrate (169er-citrate; radiosynoviorthesis or radiosynovectomy) is an effective local treatment of rheumatic joint diseases. when synovitis is proved, intra-articularly injected beta emitting radionuclides like yttrium-90 ((90)y) are used to treat the inflamed synovium. we have developed a 188re-tin-colloid as a new radiopharmaceutical agent and investigated its efficacy and safety in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. the use of radiopharmaceuticals in the detection of arthritis activity has the advantages of allowing direct imaging of joints by means of whole-body scintigraphy and of joints that are difficult to assess clinically or radiographically. beta irradiation may influence the long term maintenance of cartilage tissue or the aetiology of degenerative joint diseases. rheumatoid arthritis (ra) is an inflammatory chronic disease characterized by inflammation, pain, swelling and disability and radiosynovectomy is one of the disease treatment lines. to evaluate the treatment response of rhenium-188 (¹⁸⁸re) tin colloid radiosynovectomy (¹⁸⁸re-rsv) in patients with inflammatory knee joint conditions refractory to conventional treatment. regarding the high retention of these radiopharmaceuticals in joints with no leakage to surrounding organs, 186/188re-chitosan can be applied as new radiosynovectomy drugs for rheumatoid arthritis treatment. radionuclide synovectomy is a minimally invasive method of treating persistent joint inflammation. radiation synovectomy was performed using 188re-tin-colloid in 22 knees from 21 rheumatoid arthritis patients refractory to intra-articular corticosteroid injection. radiosynoviorthesis (rso) with an yttrium-90 colloid offers a local and minimally invasive therapy for treating inflammatory hypertrophy of the synovial membrane of the knee that has arisen from numerous kinds of disorder: these include rheumatoid arthritis (ra), osteoarthritis (oa), spondyloarthropathy, villonodular synovitis and others. there is a clinical need for therapeutic alternative in patients with persisting painful arthritis of ac-joint and failure of previous treatments. |||",Yes
Can the active ingredient acetyl salicylic acid (ASA) protect against cancer?,Yes,"The context suggests that acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) has been shown to have a protective effect against the incidence and mortality of colorectal cancer. It is also known to serve as an apoptotic agent on cancer cells through the inhibition of the COX-2 enzyme. Furthermore, ASA has been shown to have therapeutic benefits in several types of cancer, including esophageal adenocarcinoma and melanoma. The potential anticancer effects of ASA may be mediated by its ability to suppress prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production and activate 5'-adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK). However, the mechanism by which ASA acts to protect against human cancer is not yet fully understood.","acetylsalicylic acid (asa) is known to prevent cancer development, but its mechanism of action remains unclear. it is shown that acetylsalicylic acid (asa) might reduce oxidative injury and that it has a place in protection from cancer. recent observational studies have shown therapeutic benefits of acetylsalicylic acid (asa) in several types of cancer. acetylsalicylic acid (asa), a derivative from the plant hormone salicylic acid (sa), is a commonly used drug that has a dual role in animal organisms as an anti-inflammatory and anticancer agent. among different biological effects of acetylsalicylic acid (asa), its anticancer property is controversial. acetylsalicylic acid (asa, aspirin), the most common nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (nsaid), has been shown to have a protective effect against the incidence and mortality of colorectal cancer. acetyl salicylic acid (asa) is a useful drug for the secondary prevention of cerebro-cardiovascular diseases, but it has adverse effects on the small intestinal mucosa. 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-asa) may protect against the development of inflammation-associated colorectal cancer. it is known that asa serves as an apoptotic agent on cancer cells through the inhibition of the cox-2 enzyme. the aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of acetylsalicylic acid (asa) in an experimental model of esophageal adenocarcinoma. the purpose of this study was to investigate the cellular effects of acetylsalicylic acid (asa), acetaminophen, and a cox-2 inhibitor (ns-398) on the growth of cell lines of human ovarian cancer in vitro. many studies have suggested the possible efficiency of asa and other nsaids in preventing cancer. in this work, we investigated the in vitro and in vivo efficacy of acetylsalicylic acid (asa) as an antimelanoma agent in b16-f0 cells and skin b16-f0 melanoma tumor mouse model. moreover, they suggest that these novel eicosanoids, when generated within the microenvironment of tissues, may contribute to asa's therapeutic role in decreasing the risk of human cancer. potential anticancer effects of asa may be mediated by its ability to suppress prostaglandin e2 (pge2) production and activate 5'-adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (ampk). we studied the effect of asa on the survival of a human colon cancer cell line using more sensitive methods than we had applied previously. the aim of this study was to determine the effects of acetylsalicylic acid on proliferation, apoptosis, and invasion in human cyclooxygenase-2 (cox-2) negative colorectal cancer cell lines. our results also suggest that asa decreases the invasive potential of these colon cancer cells. the mechanism by which aspirin (asa) acts to protect against human cancer is not yet known. acetylsalicylic acid (asa) is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (nsaid) with many pharmacological properties, such as anti-inflammatory, antipyretic and analgesic. |||",Yes
Is tick-borne tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) much milder in children than in adults?,Yes,"The context suggests that tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) in children is often considered more benign and milder than in adults, with a more favorable outcome. However, it is not accurate to state that TBE is ""much milder"" in children than in adults. The context also provides evidence that TBE in children can result in substantial morbidity and severe long-term neurological sequelae. Furthermore, the context indicates that TBE can cause a range of symptoms in children, from asymptomatic cases to severe injuries of the nervous system. Therefore, while TBE in children may be less severe than in adults on average, it is not accurate to describe it as ""much milder.""","tick-borne encephalitis in children appears to be more benign than in adults and shows also a more favourable outcome. the course of tick-borne encephalitis (tbe) in children is supposed to be mild though severe neurological sequelae have been reported. our study provides further evidence that tick-borne encephalitis in children has a substantial morbidity and in single cases severe long-time neurological sequelae are observed. tick-borne encephalitis (tbe) is an emerging infectious disease in large parts of europe and asia. tick-borne encephalitis (tbe) is a major cause of meningoencephalitis in children in endemic areas, and long-term residual problems are not uncommon. tick borne encephalitis (tbe) is a viral infection in the central nervous system endemic in europe and asia. retrospective review of all charts of children with serologically confirmed tick-borne encephalitis hospitalised in styria between 1981 and 2005. tick-borne encephalitis virus (tbev) infections may be asymptomatic or cause severe symptoms in the central nervous system. tick-borne encephalitis (tbe) and neuroborreliosis (nb) are well-known central nervous system (cns) infections in children. the tick-borne encephalitis (tbe) virus gives rise to epidemic encephalitis. tick-borne encephalitis virus (tbev) infections can be asymptomatic or cause moderate to severe injuries of the nervous system. nearly one fourth of the children with neurologic symptoms were diagnosed with a tick-borne cns infection (tbe, n = 10 [8%] and nb, n = 21 [16.8%]). we describe the first case of tick-borne encephalitis in a 4.5-month-old male infant in germany. this study estimates the incidence of symptomatic tick-borne cns infections in children under medical care and describes the spectrum of manifestations. the aim was to describe the clinical features of tick-borne encephalitis in children with special attention to sequelae and to review the literature. we describe severe tbe in a patient who presented with fever and altered mental status after a tick bite and a specific antibody response to tbe. tick-borne encephalitis is caused by the neurotropic, positive-sense rna virus, tick-borne encephalitis virus (tbev). we previously reported that a nonfunctional chemokine receptor 5 (ccr5) and a functional toll-like receptor 3 (tlr3) predispose adults to clinical tick-borne encephalitis (tbe). clinical findings suggest a nonspecific inflammatory disease with restricted encephalitic profile compared with adult tbe. neurologic sequelae, including cognitive deficits, after childhood tick-borne encephalitis (tbe) and neuroborreliosis (nb) are not well-characterized. |||",Yes
Can regular exercise prevent or relieve migraine symptoms?,Yes,"Justification: The consensus in the literature is that regular exercise can have a positive effect on migraine symptoms, including reducing the frequency, intensity, and/or duration of migraine attacks. Some migraine patients find that regular exercise helps in reducing the frequency of headache attacks. Aerobic exercise has been shown to decrease migraine burden in persons. Exercise activates endogenous neurotransmitter signals that could be effective in reducing the intensity of migraine pain, though it may not have a direct effect on its overall frequency or duration. However, it is important to note that strenuous physical activity is also reported as a migraine trigger.","several lines of evidence affirm a positive role for exercise in the management of migraine. conclusions exercise significantly reduced the burden of migraine and the ability to engage in physical activity because of reduced impact of tension-type headache and neck pain. exercise has been frequently discussed as a method of migraine management, but the pathways by which exercise may alter migraines are unclear at present. migraine patients who are physically active may find that exercise can provoke a migraine attack or that regular exercise helps reduce the severity of their headaches. in conclusion, it seems that although exercise can trigger migraine attacks, regular exercise may have prophylactic effect on migraine frequency. the consensus is that exercise can help to reduce the frequency, intensity and/or duration of migraine attacks. some migraine patients find that regular exercise helps in reducing the frequency of headache attacks. exercise is assumed to have a positive effect on migraine. these results emphasize the importance of regular aerobic exercise for reduction of migraine burden. this review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the literature on the use of exercise for migraine treatment with regard to its efficacy, mechanism of action and role in practice. however, most of these recommendations refer to some anecdotal reports or observational studies in literature stating that regular exercise can reduce the frequency and severity of migraine. exercise is often recommended in migraine treatment, but strenuous physical activity is also reported as a migraine trigger. exercise also reduced migraine frequency, pain intensity and duration, although this was not significant compared to controls. within the exercise group, significant reduction was found for migraine frequency, pain intensity and duration, neck pain intensity, and burden of migraine; an increase in physical fitness and well-being. here, we review the associations between physical exercise and migraine from an epidemiological, therapeutical and pathophysiological perspective. specifically, a synthesis of independent lines of recent research would indicate that exercise activates endogenous neurotransmitter signals that could be effective in reducing the intensity of migraine pain, though it may not have a direct effect on its overall frequency or duration. therefore this study aimed to evaluate the effects of exercise in migraine prevention. primary results are positive effects of exercise on migraine symptoms, tension-type headache among others, and a decrease in the use of headache-related medications. aerobic exercise has been shown to decrease migraine burden in these persons. in experimental studies exercise has been reported as a trigger factor for migraine as well as migraine prophylaxis. |||",Yes
Does less than 7h of sleep daily increase mental performance?,No,"The context suggests that a sleep duration of 7-8 hours is optimal for reducing chronic disease risk and maintaining cognitive performance. Sleep laboratory studies have found that restricted sleep duration, including less than 7 hours, leads to worse short-term cognition, particularly memory. Furthermore, perceived sleep-related difficulties are more likely among individuals reporting less than 7 hours of sleep compared to those reporting 7-9 hours. Research has also associated short sleep duration with obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Therefore, it can be concluded that less than 7 hours of sleep daily does not increase mental performance.","these findings suggest a 7-8 h sleep duration directly and indirectly reduces chronic disease risk. it would appear that relatively short periods of natural and drug induced (brotizolam 0.125 mg) sleep have a beneficial effect on subsequent performance even in the absence of preceding sleep debt. beneficial effects of napping or bright light exposure on cognitive performance have been reported in participants exposed to sleep loss. these data suggest that increasing sleep duration may not directly improve quality of life, despite evidence that curtailment of nocturnal sleep is associated with fatigue. the effect which early evening sleep may have on overnight and subsequent daytime performance, and the effect which morning sleep may have on daytime performance after overnight sleep deprivation has been studied in six healthy male volunteers. sleep laboratory studies find that restricted sleep duration leads to worse short-term cognition, especially memory. the optimal night's sleep duration seems to be around 7 h, as too little sleep and too much sleep have been found to be associated with a variety of changes in well-being, physical and psychological parameters. perceived sleep-related difficulties were significantly more likely among persons reporting <7 hours of sleep than among those reporting 7-9 hours of sleep. twenty-eight per cent (28%) of adults sleep at least 1 hour less than they consider optimal, yet the effects of such cumulative mild partial sleep deprivation on cognitive functions are unknown. research associates short (and to a lesser extent long) sleep duration with obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease; and although 7-8 h of sleep seems to confer the least health risk, these findings are often based on non-representative data. planned naps can improve performance when the habitual or nocturnal sleep schedule is disrupted. in conclusion, the present study showed that one night of sleep deprivation (8 hours) resulted in significant hormonal changes on the next afternoon but did not modify tracking and muscular strength performance. sleep intervention consisted of total lack of sleep (n = 7) or 8 hours of sleep (control group; n = 7) during the night. self-reported sleep showed little association with cognitive function. whereas sleep restriction in the laboratory induces sleepiness and mood disturbances, it is not certain whether a short sleep duration impairs the quality of everyday life. the national sleep foundation suggests that adults need 7-9 hours of sleep per night; shorter and longer sleep durations have been associated with increased morbidity and mortality. in the sleep study of the national social life, health, and aging project (nshap), a nationally representative cohort of older us adults (2010-2015), we examined whether self-reported and actigraph-measured sleep are associated with cross-sectional cognitive function and 5-year cognitive decline. using population-based data, we explored whether greater habitual sleep duration is a predictor of better health-related quality of life, measured by the quality of well-being (qwb) scale. analysis showed sleepiness and performance after the nap significantly improved compared with the control condition. observational studies find associations between self-reported sleep duration or quality and cognitive function. |||",No
Does regular intake of extra virgin olive oil protect against coronary heart disease such as heart attack?,Yes,"The data suggests that regular intake of extra virgin olive oil is associated with reduced risks of cardiovascular disease and mortality in individuals at high cardiovascular risk. The protective effects of olive oil against coronary heart disease may be attributed to its richness in monounsaturated fatty acids and anti-inflammatory compounds. A high intake of olive oil has been proposed as an explanation for the low incidence of coronary heart disease in Mediterranean countries. The polyphenol fraction of extra-virgin olive oil may be partly responsible for its cardioprotective effects. In conclusion, olive oil consumption was related to a reduced risk of incident coronary heart disease events.","olive oil consumption, specifically the extra-virgin variety, is associated with reduced risks of cardiovascular disease and mortality in individuals at high cardiovascular risk. our data suggest that olive oil may reduce the risk of coronary disease. many mechanistic reasons support that a high consumption of olive oil may provide a protection against myocardial infarction, the hallmark of ischemic heart disease. olive oil, being rich in mono-unsaturated fatty acids and anti-inflammatory compounds, may have protective effects against cardiovascular disease (cvd). higher baseline total olive oil consumption was associated with 48% (hr: 0.52; 95% ci: 0.29 to 0.93) reduced risk of cardiovascular mortality. higher olive oil intake was associated with lower risk of chd and total cvd in 2 large prospective cohorts of u.s. men and women. the polyphenol fraction of extra-virgin olive oil may be partly responsible for its cardioprotective effects. a high intake of olive oil has been proposed as an explanation for the low incidence of coronary heart disease in mediterranean countries, but it is unclear whether olive oil offers specific benefits beyond a low content of saturated fat. the aim was to assess the association between total olive oil intake, its varieties (extra virgin and common olive oil) and the risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality in a mediterranean population at high cardiovascular risk. these findings support exclusive olive oil consumption, a key component of the mediterranean diet, for the primary cvd prevention, in adults without pre-existing disease. this study sought to examine whether olive oil intake is associated with total cvd, coronary heart disease (chd), and stroke risk. for each 10 g/d increase in extra-virgin olive oil consumption, cardiovascular disease and mortality risk decreased by 10% and 7%, respectively. after adjusting for major diet and lifestyle factors, compared with nonconsumers, those with higher olive oil intake (>0.5 tablespoon/day or >7 g/day) had 14% lower risk of cvd (pooled hr: 0.86; 95% ci: 0.79 to 0.94) and 18% lower risk of chd (pooled hr: 0.82; 95% ci: 0.73 to 0.91). olive oil intake has been associated with lower risk of cardiovascular disease (cvd) in mediterranean populations, but little is known about these associations in the u.s population. an inverse relation between high consumption of olive oil and low incidence of coronary heart disease among the people living in mediterranean countries has been proposed. in conclusion, olive oil consumption was related to a reduced risk of incident chd events. besides the classical benefits on the lipid profile provided by olive oil consumption compared with that of saturated fat, a broad spectrum of benefits on cardiovascular risk factors is now emerging associated with olive oil consumption. extra virgin olive oil (evoo) intake is associated with reduced cardiovascular risk, and its phenolic compound oleocanthal (oc) has anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. olive oil is well known for its cardioprotective properties; however, epidemiological data showing that olive oil consumption reduces incident chd events are still limited. the exposure to the upper quintile of energy-adjusted olive oil (median intake: 54 g/day) was associated with a statistically significant 82% relative reduction in the risk of a first myocardial infarction (or = 0.18; 95% ci : 0.06-0.63) after adjustment for dietary and non-dietary confounders. |||",Yes
Do frequent ejaculations have a protective effect against prostate cancer?,Yes,"The evidence suggests that frequent ejaculations may have a protective effect against the development of prostate cancer. Studies have found that men who reported higher ejaculatory frequency in adulthood were less likely to be diagnosed with prostate cancer compared to those who reported lower frequency. This inverse relationship between ejaculation frequency and prostate cancer risk has been observed in a large US-based study, and is consistent with the theory that normal testicular function, including sufficient steroidogenesis, is an important contributing factor to the later development of this malignancy. However, it is important to note that the protective effect of frequent ejaculations may be limited to low-risk prostate cancer, as ejaculation frequency was not found to be statistically significantly associated with the risk of advanced prostate cancer. Additionally, while sexual activity has been hypothesized to play a role in the development of prostate cancer, the evidence is limited and further research is needed to fully understand the relationship between sexual activity and prostate cancer risk.","frequent ejaculation seems to be protective from the development of prostate cancer. however, high ejaculation frequency was related to decreased risk of total prostate cancer. our results suggest that ejaculation frequency is not related to increased risk of prostate cancer. we evaluated whether ejaculation frequency throughout adulthood is related to prostate cancer risk in a large us-based study. we found that men reporting higher compared to lower ejaculatory frequency in adulthood were less likely to be subsequently diagnosed with prostate cancer. evidence suggests that ejaculation frequency may be inversely related to the risk of prostate cancer (pca), a disease for which few modifiable risk factors have been identified. ejaculation frequency was not statistically significantly associated with risk of advanced prostate cancer. these findings provide additional evidence of a beneficial role of more frequent ejaculation throughout adult life in the etiology of pca, particularly for low-risk disease. to examine the association between ejaculation frequency, which includes sexual intercourse, nocturnal emission, and masturbation and risk of prostate cancer. a man's risk of prostate cancer has been linked to his prior reproductive history, with low sperm quality, low ejaculation frequency, and a low number of offspring being associated with increased prostate cancer risk. epidemiological studies report that regular physical activity can reduce the risk for prostate cancer. while some data indicate high bother from erectile dysfunction (ed) following prostate cancer treatments, other results suggest the life-saving nature of the treatment may mitigate ed concern. we conclude that enduring male infertility is associated with a reduced prostate cancer risk, thus corroborating the theory that normal testicular function, and hence most probably sufficient steroidogenesis, is an important contributing factor to the later development of this malignancy. vasectomy is associated with a statistically significantly increased long-term risk of prostate cancer. sexual activity can affect prostate cancer pathogenesis in a variety of ways; including the proposed high androgen status, risk of sexually transmitted infections and the potential effect of retained carcinogens within the prostatic cells. however, it remains unclear whether regularly taking aspirin could lower the risk of prostate cancer. sexual activity has been hypothesized to play a role in the development of prostate cancer, but epidemiological data are virtually limited to case-control studies, which may be prone to bias because recall among individuals with prostate cancer could be distorted as a consequence of prostate malignancy or ongoing therapy. multiple sexual partners may be protective from prostate cancer, excluding the risk of sexually transmitted infections. regular aspirin use was significantly associated with a lower self-reported prevalence of prostate cancer after adjusting for predisposing, enabling, and need factors (odds ratio 0.60, 95% confidence interval 0.38-0.94).regular aspirin use was found to be significantly associated with a lower self-reported prevalence of prostate cancer in the united states in 2010. prostate cancer (pca) is the leading cause of cancer mortality among older men in western countries. |||",Yes
Do today's children have a shorter life expectancy than their parents?,Yes,"The evidence suggests that children born in the last decade of the 20th century are healthier and living longer than children born earlier this century. Additionally, children born too small or too soon are now more likely to reach adulthood than similar children born 10 or 20 years ago. While there are concerns about the impact of the global childhood obesity epidemic on the life expectancy of the current generation, the evidence does not support the claim that today's children have a shorter life expectancy than their parents.","the life spans of parents and children appear only weakly related, even though parents affect their children's longevity through both genetic and environmental influences. it is shown that even if children perfectly inherit their frailty from their parents, parents' life spans explain little of the variance in children's life spans, because the variance in life expectancies among people with different frailties is small compared with the variance in life spans among people at the same level of frailty. lower educated individuals not only have shorter life expectancies, but also face greater uncertainty about the age at which they will die. offspring quality decreases with parental age in many taxa, with offspring of older parents exhibiting reduced life span, reproductive capacity, and fitness, compared to offspring of younger parents. we set out to examine whether lower educated groups face greater variation in lifespans in addition to having a shorter life expectancy, in order to identify entry points for policies to reduce the impact of socio-economic position on mortality. we explored demographic, health behaviour, health and socioeconomic correlates of subjectively estimated lifespan ('anticipated survival'); the ability of anticipated survival to predict actual survival; and whether the predictive ability of anticipated survival differed by other variables, particularly socioeconomic position. there is much evidence that the children born in the last decade of the 20th century are healthier and living longer than children born earlier this century, and that children born too small or too soon are now more likely to reach adulthood than similar children born 10 or 20 years ago. given the emerging global childhood obesity epidemic and the specter of a generation of children who will have a shorter life expectancy than that of their parents, recent research has focused on factors that influence children's weight status and obesogenic behaviors (i.e., eating, physical activity, and screen media use). greater lifespan variation in lower educated groups was largely driven by conditions causing death at younger ages, such as injuries and neoplasms. in addition to altering the timing of offspring life-history milestones, parental age effects can also have a negative impact on offspring size, with offspring of older parents being smaller than offspring of younger parents. parental age effects are important because they may have feedback effects on the evolution of demographic trajectories and longevity. according to life course theories, the impact of socio-economic disadvantage can accumulate across the life span, leading to worse health in later life. whereas it is well established that people with a lower socio-economic position have a shorter average lifespan, it is less clear what the variability surrounding these averages is. yet measures of social disadvantage (poverty, underachievement in education, lone parenthood) are increasing, putting this generation of children at higher risk of morbidity later in life. these ""parental age effects,"" whose consequences arise in the next generation, can be considered as manifestations of parental senescence, in addition to the more familiar age-related declines in parent-generation survival and reproduction. socioeconomic disadvantage may cause individuals to have lower expectations of longevity and not engage in healthy behaviours because they judge the long-term health benefits of these to be minimal. these influences can be summarized as a correlation between parents' and children's frailty. the results suggest that hiv-related parental death may contribute to accelerated telomere shortening and highlight that telomere length may be a novel and useful biomarker for health needs assessment in pediatric aids care. results showed that aids orphans had a shorter telomere length than children living with hiv-positive parents and that such differences in telomere length were more evident than were differences in depressive symptoms. this study, therefore, examined the effects of hiv-related parental death on telomere length, a biomarker of cellular aging. |||",Yes
Does training on vibration platforms cause a noticeable buildup of muscle strength?,Yes,"Current evidence suggests that vibration training is effective in enhancing strength and power capacity of humans. The vibration elicits involuntary muscle stretch reflex contractions, leading to increased motor unit recruitment and synchronization of synergist muscles. This may result in greater training adaptations over time, contributing to a noticeable buildup of muscle strength. Vibration training has been combined with conventional resistance training to attain greater gains in neuromuscular performance. Although the effect of vibration on strength and power development is dependent on various factors, such as vibration characteristics and exercise protocols, it has been suggested as an effective methodology to improve muscle strength and power performance.","whole-body vibration (wbv) training uses a vertically oscillating platform and reports suggest that this perturbation elicits reflexive muscle contractions that augment muscle activity and contribute to increased strength. increased loading should aid muscle hypertrophy, and some authors have suggested that vibration may enhance neuromuscular potentiation. vibration causes an increase in the g-forces acting on the muscles, increasing the loading parameters of any exercise. the employment of a greater exercise intensity and volume within a vibration training programme may facilitate a larger enhancement in strength and power. the vibration elicits involuntary muscle stretch reflex contractions leading to increased motor unit recruitment and synchronization of synergist muscles, which may lead to greater training adaptations over time. current evidence suggests that vibration is effective in enhancing strength and the power capacity of humans, although the mechanisms mediating this effect are unknown. although there is a lack of strictly controlled studies on the vibration training effect, current findings in this area suggest that vibration may have a beneficiary acute and/or chronic training effect on strength and power enhancement. the aim of this literature review was to determine whether vibration training could produce chronic improvements in the physical performance of trained athletes. considering the 6 studies on trained athletes, there does seem to be some evidence to suggest that vibration may provide a small benefit to maximal strength (1-repetition maximum) and power (countermovement jumps) of trained athletes. several studies link the effects of vibration training to enhanced neuromuscular demand, typically ascribed to involuntary reflex mechanisms. previous studies have suggested that short-term whole-body vibration (wbv) training produces neuromuscular improvement similar to that of power and strength training. the use of vibration as a means for enhancing athletic performance is a recent issue in exercise physiology. however, the effect of vibration on strength and power development appears dependent upon the vibration characteristics (method of application, amplitude and frequency) and exercise protocols (training type, intensity and volume) employed. vibration has been combined with conventional resistance training in an attempt to attain greater gains in neuromuscular performance than from conventional resistance training alone. vibration exercise (ve) has been suggested as an effective methodology to improve muscle strength and power performance. because whole-body vibration does not seem to be detrimental to performance when used in a controlled manner, it could provide an additional training stimulus for athletes. vibration exercise (ve) has been suggested as an effective option to improve muscle strength and power performance. vibration applied directly or indirectly to a targeted muscle) may have an influence on the magnitude of amplitude and frequency that are delivered to the muscle and, therefore, may have an influence on vibration training effect. vibration training has been suggested as an alternative option for muscle conditioning, aiming especially at improving muscle strength and power. this paper proposes additional methods to analyze the mechanisms involved in vibration training. |||",Yes
Does glucosamine prolong life?,Yes,"The context suggests that glucosamine administration has been shown to improve survival rates in various studies. In one study, glucosamine administration significantly increased the survival rate in comparison with mannitol administration in mice (percentage of survival after 2 h, 47% vs. 20%; p < 0.05). In another study, glucosamine administration improved the survival rate after trauma-hemorrhage without resuscitation in rats, which was related to the glucosamine-induced increase in protein o-glycosylation. Furthermore, glucosamine has been shown to inhibit proteasomal activity and the proliferation of prostate cancer cells, which may contribute to its potential life-prolonging effects. However, it is important to note that more research is needed to fully understand the long-term effects of glucosamine on survival and its potential side effects.","glucosamine, a naturally occurring amino monosaccharide, has been reported to play a role in the regulation of apoptosis more than half century. scientific studies have supported that glucosamine has the beneficial pharmacological effects to relieve osteoarthritis symptoms. glucosamine is now widely used in the hope that it will relieve symptoms of osteoarthritis and stop its progression, yet studies have so far failed to prove convincingly that it works, how it might work, or whether it is safe to take long-term. glucosamine is used for alleviating pain in osteoarthritis. recent studies have shown that glucosamine also possesses immunosuppressive properties and is effective in prolonging graft survival in mice. glucosamine administration significantly increased the survival rate in comparison with mannitol administration (percentage of survival after 2 h, 47% vs. 20%; p < 0.05). glucosamine, a natural glucose derivative and an essential component of glycoproteins and proteoglycans, has been safely used to relieve osteoarthritis in humans. glucosamine can also be as a promising candidate for the prevention and/or treatment of some other diseases due to its anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. the purpose of the study was to evaluate the effect of glucosamine on the survival, without resuscitation, in rats. glucosamine (glcn) is a common drug used to treat osteoarthritis (oa). in this review, we present a concise update on additional new therapeutic applications of glucosamine including treatment of cardiovascular disease, neurological deficits, skin disorders, cancer and the molecular mechanistic rationale for these uses. glucosamine administration improves the survival rate after trauma-hemorrhage without resuscitation; this effect may be related to the glucosamine-induced increase in protein o-glycosylation. we have previously shown that glucosamine administration resulted in higher cardiac output and improved tissue perfusion after trauma-hemorrhage with resuscitation in rats, which was associated with the increased levels of protein o-linked-n-acetylglucosamine (o-glcnac). in the present study, we found glucosamine inhibited proteasomal activity and the proliferation of alva41 prostate cancer cells. study demonstrates that oral glucosamine doses that produce clinically relevant serum glucosamine concentrations can induce tissue tgfβ1 and ctgf expression in vivo and provides a mechanistic rationale for reported beneficial effects of glucosamine therapy. the protein o-glcnac levels, assessed 30 min after glucosamine treatment, were significantly increased in the heart, brain, and liver. considering that o-glcnac modification of proteasome subunits inhibits its activity, we examined whether glucosamine induces growth inhibition via affecting proteasomal activity. glucosamine treatment increased flux through the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway and increased o-glcnac levels but had no effect on atp levels. induction of renal tgfβ1 and ctgf mrna suggests that potential sclerotic side-effects may occur following consumption of potent glucosamine preparations. many studies have reported the effectiveness of oral doses of glucosamine alone or in combination with the galactosamine containing chondroitin in treating osteoarthritis. |||",Yes
Do injections with Botulinum Toxin A (Botox®) help with urinary incontinence?,Yes,"The use of Botulinum Toxin A (Botox®) injections for the treatment of urinary incontinence has been widely accepted in the medical communities of urology and urogynecology. These injections have been found to be effective in managing lower urinary tract symptoms, including overactive bladder and detrusor overactivity, whether of neurogenic or idiopathic etiology. The application of Botulinum Toxin A in the lower urinary tract has produced promising results in treating lower urinary tract dysfunction. Intradetrusor injections of Botulinum Toxin A into patients with detrusor overactivity have resulted in significant increases in mean maximum cystometric capacity and detrusor compliance, with a reduction in mean maximum detrusor pressures. Furthermore, Botulinum Toxin A injections into the external urethral sphincter have been successfully used to treat detrusor sphincter dyssynergia and have recently been expanded to include voiding dysfunction. Therefore, it can be concluded that Botulinum Toxin A injections are an effective treatment for urinary incontinence.","botulinum toxin injection has been widely accepted by the urology and urogynecology medical communities as a safe and effective treatment for refractory urinary incontinence. in addition, it might be expected that urethral botulinum toxin injections improve bladder emptying in patients with dysfunctional voiding problems besides detrusor external sphincter dyssynergia. application of botulinum toxin in the lower urinary tract has produced promising results in treating lower urinary tract dysfunction, which needs further evaluation with randomised, placebo-controlled trials. intradetrusal injections of botulinum toxin into patients with detrusor overactivity and symptoms of the overactive bladder have resulted in significant increases in mean maximum cystometric capacity and detrusor compliance with a reduction in mean maximum detrusor pressures. botox) provides effective treatment for overactive bladder. in recent years, botulinum-a neurotoxin has increasingly been used to manage lower urinary tract symptoms, including overactive bladder and detrusor overactivity (do), either due to neurogenic or idiopathic etiology. botulinum toxin injections into the external urethral sphincter to treat detrusor sphincter dyssynergia has been successfully used for some years but recently its use has expanded to include voiding dysfunction. intravesical onabotulinumtoxina (botox) injections are effective for the treatment of idiopathic overactive bladder (oab) symptoms. onabotulinum toxin a (botox®) administered intravescially is an effective treatment for idiopathic detrusor overactivity, of which urinary tract infections (utis) are a common complication. with the present review we aimed at assessing the state of the art on the mechanisms of function of botulinum toxins in the management of urological dysfunctions. intradetrusor injection of botulinum toxin a (btx-a) might serve as a minimally invasive substitute in patients with refractory idiopathic overactive bladder (rioab). botulinum toxin type a (btx-a) has been successfully used in the treatment of patients with overactive bladder (oab) symptoms refractory to anticholinergic therapy, with most studies performing trigone-sparing detrusor injections. to review the available literature on the application of botulinum toxin in the urinary tract, with particular reference to its use in treating detrusor overactivity (do). botulinum toxin a (btx-a) injection into the detrusor muscle has changed therapy options for patients with overactive bladder (oab). although botulinum toxin (bont/a) injected into the detrusor muscle improves overactive bladder symptoms in patients with neurogenic detrusor overactivity, how it does so remains unclear. limited studies to date have reported on the onset of effect of intradetrusor botulinum neurotoxin type a (bonta) injections when used to treat the symptoms of the overactive bladder (oab). we performed a critical review of published studies evaluating botulinum treatment for overactive bladder and its reported effects on voiding function. botulinum toxin type a (bont/a) proved very effective in therapy for hyperactive detrusor or sphincter dysfunction of neurogenic and non-neurogenic origin. in addition, the application of botulinum toxin was extended to the treatment of other urological disorders including non-neurogenic detrusor overactivity, non-relaxing urethral sphincter and detrusor underactivity. botulinum toxin a (bont-a) is a new treatment modality in various causes of bladder dysfunction; like neurogenic detrusor overactivity and overactive bladder. |||",Yes
Can apigenin reduce cancer risk or prevent cancer progression?,No,"The context suggests that apigenin, a plant flavonoid, has shown potential in cancer prevention and inhibition of tumor growth. It has been found to reduce the proliferation of colon cancer cell lines and induce apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. Apigenin has also been reported to inhibit the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in human ovarian cancer cells, which is a critical factor in angiogenesis, a process that supports tumor growth. Furthermore, apigenin has been shown to elevate p53, a critical molecule in the induction of apoptosis. However, caution is advised in dietary intake of apigenin during disease as it potentially interferes with cancer treatment. Therefore, based on the context, it can be concluded that apigenin has the potential to reduce cancer risk and prevent cancer progression.","these results suggest that dietary apigenin showed promise in cancer prevention by reducing the odc activity and acf formation, however, clear evidence of cancer prevention was not obtained in mouse tumor studies. a promising nutraceutical, apigenin, was recently revealed to exhibit biological activity in inhibiting several types of cancer. apigenin is a plant flavonoid that is thought to play a role in the prevention of carcinogenesis. further investigation of the potential chemopreventive effect of apigenin in carcinogenesis is warranted. when testing the effect of apigenin in vivo, we found that apigenin significantly inhibited tumor growth in nude mice. apigenin reduced the proliferation of colon cancer cell lines, stimulated the cleavage of parp and induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. apigenin is a natural flavonoid that exhibits anti-proliferative activity and induces apoptosis in various types of cancer, including colon cancer. thus, this study shows that although apigenin is a potential chemopreventive agent due to the induction of leukemia cell-cycle arrest, caution in dietary intake of apigenin should be taken during disease as it potentially interferes with cancer treatment. epidemiological and experimental evidence suggests that dietary flavonoids, including apigenin, have anticancer roles. apigenin, a dietary plant derived flavone subclass of flavonoid is expected to play a role in cancer chemoprevention and cancer chemotherapy. our data suggested that apigenin may inhibit human lung cancer angiogenesis by inhibiting hif-1alpha and vegf expression, thus providing a novel explanation for the anticancer action of apigenin. in this study, we found that apigenin inhibited a549 lung cancer cell proliferation and vascular endothelial growth factor (vegf) transcriptional activation in a dose-dependent manner. apigenin, a dietary plant-flavonoid has shown anti-proliferative and anticancer properties, however the molecular basis of this effect remains to be elucidated. our results provide a new insight into the mechanisms that apigenin inhibits ovarian cancers. apigenin has been reported to elevate p53, a critical molecule in the induction of apoptosis. apigenin is a nontoxic dietary flavonoid that has been shown to possess anti-tumor properties and therefore poses special interest for the development of a novel chemopreventive and/or chemotherapeutic agent for cancer. in two aom-treated mouse colon tumor studies 0.025% and 0.1% dietary apigenin modestly reduced tumors in the group fed 0.025% apigenin (25% incidence in comparison with 65% in the controls) in a non-dose response manner. apigenin intake by these mice also resulted in induction of apoptosis, which positively correlated with serum and tumor apigenin levels. herein we show that the common dietary flavonoid apigenin has anticancer activity, but also may decrease chemotherapy sensitivity, depending on the cell type. here we demonstrate that apigenin inhibits expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (vegf) in human ovarian cancer cells. |||",No
Do generic drugs work as well as original drugs?,Yes,"The context provided indicates that generic drugs are considered therapeutically equivalent to their original counterparts, as they have the same active pharmaceutical ingredients, dosage forms, strength, quality, indications, effects, directions, and dosage.

Studies have shown that generic drugs are at least similar, and in some cases superior, to their branded counterparts regarding mortality and major cardiovascular events. Additionally, the use of generic drugs, which are bioequivalent to brand-name drugs, can help contain prescription drug spending. Therefore, it can be concluded that generic drugs work as well as original drugs.","generic medicines are clinically interchangeable with original brand medicines and have the same quality, efficacy and safety profiles. as more and more generic drug products become available in the marketplace, it is a concern whether these generic drug products can be used interchangeably in terms of their quality, safety, and efficacy. generic drugs are interchangeable with original proprietary drugs, as they have the same active pharmaceutical ingredients, dosage forms, strength, quality, indications, effects, directions, and dosage. generic medications offer substantial potential cost savings to health systems compared to their branded counterparts. generic drugs are considered therapeutically equivalent to their original counterparts and lower in acquisition costs. however, there is concern among patients and physicians that brand-name drugs may be clinically superior to generic drugs. in general, a generic drug is considered interchangeable with the original formulated drug. generic drugs are widely prescribed by physicians, although there is disagreement over the clinical comparability of generic drugs to brand-name drugs within the physician community. to test whether (1) generics and original products yield the same health outcomes, and (2) generic therapies save economic resources versus original therapies. case studies are discussed to demonstrate that generic pharmaceuticals are therapeutically equivalent to the branded product, even though the color, size, shape, and excipients utilized may not be identical. in conclusion, generic medications were at least similar, and in some cases superior, to their branded counterparts regarding mortality and major cardiovascular events. generic drugs are considered the best alternative for the originator brand drugs because they have the same quality, safety, and efficacy yet offered at considerbaly lower cost. the availability of generic products of antiepileptic drugs (aeds) has raised the following concerns: (1) do generic aeds work as well as brand aeds in terms of their efficacy, safety and quality? generic drugs are equivalent to the brand formulation if they have the same active substance, the same pharmaceutical form and the same therapeutic indications and a similar bioequivalence respect to the reference medicinal product. generic drugs are cost-effective versions of brand-name drugs approved by the food and drug administration (fda) following proof of pharmaceutical equivalence and bioequivalence. thus, while providing the same therapeutic outcomes, generic medicines lead to substantial savings for healthcare systems. the united states food and drug administration (fda) indicates that an approved generic drug product can serve as a substitute for the innovative drug product. the global pharmaceutical industry consists of innovators and generics. studies compared generic and brand-name cardiovascular drugs using clinical efficacy and safety end points. use of generic drugs, which are bioequivalent to brand-name drugs, can help contain prescription drug spending. |||",Yes
Are animal-assisted therapies effective for mental illness?,Yes,"Animal-assisted therapies have been shown to be effective in the treatment of various mental illnesses. Studies have reported statistically significant reductions in anxiety levels for hospitalized psychiatric patients with psychotic disorders, mood disorders, and other disorders after a session of animal-assisted therapy. Animal-assisted therapy has also been found to be beneficial in the treatment of autism spectrum disorders, depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Furthermore, the use of animal-assisted interventions in therapeutic programs is a growing phenomenon, and research has demonstrated that the interaction between patients, animals, and therapists can improve communication, elevate self-confidence, reduce symptoms of diseases, and improve the quality of life.","this study examined whether a session of animal-assisted therapy reduced the anxiety levels of hospitalized psychiatric patients and whether any differences in reductions in anxiety were associated with patients' diagnoses. statistically significant reductions in anxiety scores were found after the animal-assisted therapy session for patients with psychotic disorders, mood disorders, and other disorders, and after the therapeutic recreation session for patients with mood disorders. a growing body of evidence suggests that animal-assisted therapies and activities involving all kinds of real and even robotic animals can have beneficial eff ects in people with neurological disease or mental illness. animal-assisted therapy was associated with reduced state anxiety levels for hospitalized patients with a variety of psychiatric diagnoses, while a routine therapeutic recreation session was associated with reduced levels only for patients with mood disorders. animal-assisted therapy (aat) has been shown to be effective in the treatment of many psychological disorders, including autism spectrum disorders, depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder (ptsd). the results of animal assisted therapy in the treatment of ptsd patients have seen significant results. we tested the hypothesis that animal-assisted therapy (aat) may improve anhedonia. the aim of this systematic review is to establish the efficacy of animal assisted therapies in the management of dementia, depression and other conditions in adult population. animal-assisted therapy (aat), most frequently used with dogs, is being used increasingly as an adjunctive alternative treatment for psychiatric patients. for years, animals have been used with great benefit in the treatment of the aged and the terminally ill. now animal assisted therapy is benefitting sufferers of ptsd. to investigate the efficacy of animal-assisted therapy (aat) on symptoms of agitation/aggression and depression in nursing home residents with dementia in a randomized controlled trial. the use of animal-assisted interventions in therapeutic programs is a growing phenomenon. background: animal-assisted interventions are classified as 'any therapeutic process that intentionally includes or involves animals as part of the process'. animal-assisted therapy is a familiar method of treatment in the rehabilitation of many illnesses and conditions, but is still not applied sufficiently in our milieu. animal therapy is making strides in the treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder (ptsd). this paper gives an overview of the available literature and some of the research which demonstrates that the interaction between the patient, animal and therapist provides a context which improves communication, elevates self-confidence, reduces the symptoms of diseases, and improves the quality of life. the aim of this study was to investigate if the inclusion of an animal adds value to psychosocial interventions for people with dementia. the positive effects of animal-assisted interventions (aais) in people with dementia have been frequently reported in the literature. animal-assisted therapy involves interaction between patients and a trained animal, along with its human owner or handler, with the aim of facilitating patients' progress toward therapeutic goals. research shows a more rapid reduction of symptoms of many diseases when animals are included in the therapeutic process. |||",Yes
Do air ions cause an improvement of asthma??,No,"The available evidence on the effectiveness of positive and negative ion generators in people with asthma is often inconclusive. Although a slight but significant improvement in lung function was demonstrated in nine patients during positive and negative ion exposure, there were no significant differences in symptoms or beta-2 agonist usage between ionised and control air in three studies. Furthermore, the use of ionisers cannot be recommended in the homes of asthmatic subjects to improve their symptoms. Therefore, it is not possible to definitively state that air ions cause an improvement of asthma.","the influence of artificially generated atmospheric ions is studied in 15 patients with bronchial asthma. manufacturers of ionisers claim many benefits from the use of their devices, including the relief of asthma. a slight but significant (at 5% level) improvement in the lung function was demonstrated in nine patients during positive as well as negative ion exposure, but the patients' subjective votings of the air quality did not show any changes due to ion exposure. previous reports have shown that ion content in the air may have an effect on respiratory function. previous reports have shown that ion content in the air may have an effect on respiratory function. particles removed from the air are likely to include airborne allergens, so ionisers may achieve an effect by reducing the allergen load. no change in the histamine threshold of the airways in six patients with bronchial asthma was demonstrated during exposure to ions. the effect of ionisers on airborne concentrations of house dust mite allergen der p i was investigated in a double blind, crossover, placebo controlled trial in the homes of 20 children with allergic asthma. there were no significant differences in symptoms or beta-2 agonist usage between ionised and control air in three studies.effects of positive ion generators (one study) this study demonstrated that although positively ionised air was associated with a larger fall in fev1 with exercise, this did not reach statistical significance. in combination with other allergen avoidance measures, the examined air-cleaners can contribute to diminished allergen exposure and improvement of airway hyperresponsiveness in asthmatic patients. we conducted a systematic review of the available evidence to determine the effectiveness of positive and negative ion generators in people with asthma. we conducted a systematic review of the available evidence to determine the effectiveness of positive and negative ion generators in people with asthma. results from studies which test the efficacy of air ionisers to reduce asthma symptoms are often inconclusive and their use as a treatment for asthma remains debatable. results from studies which test the efficacy of air ionisers to reduce asthma symptoms are often inconclusive and their use as a treatment for asthma remains debatable. it is well-known that many patients with asthma undergo clinical improvement during a stay at high altitude. effects of positive ion generators (one study)this study demonstrated that although positively ionised air was associated with a larger fall in fev1 with exercise, this did not reach statistical significance. recent evidence shows that this treatment also improves airway inflammation in nonallergic patients. randomised controlled trials (parallel or crossover design studies) comparing ionisers with dummy ionisers (being negative or positive ion emitters), in children or adults with chronic asthma. randomised controlled trials (parallel or crossover design studies) comparing ionisers with dummy ionisers (being negative or positive ion emitters), in children or adults with chronic asthma. this study indicates that the use of ionisers cannot be recommended in the homes of asthmatic subjects to improve their symptoms. |||",No
Do smoking bans lead to fewer preterm births?,Yes,"The context suggests that smoking cessation during pregnancy can reduce the risk of poor birth outcomes, including preterm birth. Smoking bans, which aim to reduce smoking rates, could therefore contribute to a reduction in preterm births. The context also indicates that smoking during pregnancy is associated with adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes such as preterm delivery, intrauterine growth restriction, stillbirth, and low birth weight. Therefore, it can be inferred that smoking bans, by reducing smoking rates, could lead to fewer preterm births.","changes in smoking habits influence the risk of preterm delivery as well. smoking is a well recognized risk factor for low birthweight infants and has been implicated in preterm birth. smoking remains one of the few potentially preventable factors associated with low birthweight, very preterm birth and perinatal death. cigarette smoking caused a reduction in the incidence of fetal breathing movements in normal and abnormal pregnancies. recent randomized trials indicate that women who quit smoking early in pregnancy reduce their risk of delivering a lbw infant. cigarette smoking during pregnancy increases the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes and women who quit smoking at this time are able to reduce the risk of low birth weight, preterm labour, spontaneous abortion and perinatal death. research has shown that pregnant women who smoke cigarettes increase their risk of having low birthweight (lbw) infants. smoking cessation during pregnancy can reduce the risk of poor birth outcomes. previous preterm delivery and maternal smoking are associated with increased risks of preterm delivery. smoking during pregnancy is associated with adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes such as preterm delivery, intrauterine growth restriction, stillbirth, and low birth weight. the women who quit smoking between pregnancies were not at increased risk for very or moderately preterm delivery, whereas the women who started to smoke in the second pregnancy had the same risk as those who continued to smoke. we studied the associations among smoking habits, previous very preterm or moderately preterm delivery (before 32 weeks and at 32 to 36 weeks, respectively), and the risk of a subsequent very preterm or moderately preterm delivery in a population-based cohort of 243,858 women in sweden between 1983 and 1993. smoking cessation programs in pregnancy appear to reduce smoking, low birthweight and preterm birth, but no effect was detected for very low birthweight or perinatal mortality. despite awareness of negative health outcomes associated with smoking, pregnant smokers might reduce their tobacco consumption thinking that a low smoking rate reduces smoking-related negative birth outcomes. although smoking during pregnancy may lead to many adverse effects, such as fetal growth restriction, placental abruption, stillbirth, and preterm labor, smoking is the only environmental exposure known to consistently reduce the risk of preeclampsia and gestational hypertension. smoking is a risk factor in pregnancy. in spite of the well-known effect of tobacco on embryo growth retardation, of the higher perinatal mortality of the offspring of smoking mothers, and of the dependence of perinatal mortality risk on small birth weight, it has consistently been found that small infants of smoking mothers have lower mortality rates than small infants of non-smoking mothers. hence nicotine appeared to be the factor in cigarette smoke responsible for the reduction in the incidence of fetal breathing movements. approximately 360,000-500,000 smoke-exposed infants are born yearly, and prenatal smoking remains a leading modifiable cause of poor birth outcomes (e.g. prenatal smoking (11.5% of all births) was significantly associated with very (aor=1.5, 95% ci=1.4, 1.6); moderate (aor=1.4, 95% ci=1.4, 1.4); and late (aor=1.2, 95% ci=1.2, 1.3) preterm deliveries; term low birth weight deliveries (aor=2.3, 95% ci=2.3, 2.5); sids (aor=2.7, 95% ci=2.4, 3.0); and preterm-related deaths (aor=1.5, 95% ci=1.4, 1.6). |||",Yes
Does alcohol in moderate amounts prolong life?,Yes,"The context suggests that long-term light to moderate alcohol consumption is associated with a decreased risk of death and cardiac events. This is supported by several epidemiological studies, including the Zutphen study, which found that light to moderate drinkers had a lower risk of death and cardiac events compared to never or occasional drinkers. Furthermore, moderate alcohol consumption has been linked to better cognitive health in middle-aged and older adults. However, it is important to note that the mechanisms underlying the cardioprotective effect of light to moderate alcohol intake are not well understood, and more studies are needed to verify these findings. Additionally, the context mentions that heavy alcohol use can have detrimental effects on brain functioning and may resemble age-related changes. Therefore, while moderate alcohol consumption may have some health benefits, it is important to consume alcohol in moderation and consider individual health factors.","long-term light alcohol intake lowered cardiovascular and all-cause mortality risk and increased life expectancy. recent studies have suggested that moderate alcohol consumption is associated with beneficial effects related to the prevention of cardiovascular diseases. on the contrary, at the moment, several epidemiological studies have suggested that moderate consumption of alcohol reduces overall mortality, mainly from coronary diseases. light to moderate alcohol consumption was associated with significantly lower rates of cardiac events and longer survival, independent of its anti-inflammatory effect. the impact of long-term alcohol intake and types of alcoholic beverages consumed on cardiovascular mortality and life expectancy at age 50 was investigated in the zutphen study, a cohort of 1373 men born between 1900 and 1920 and examined repeatedly between 1960 and 2000. whether a lifestyle of moderate-heavy alcohol use in older adults increased age-related brain changes was examined. after adjustment for confounders, compared with never or occasional drinkers, light to moderate drinkers (1-7 drinks per week) showed a decreased risk of death (hazard ratio [hr], 0.75; 95% confidence interval [ci], 0.56-1.00) and cardiac events (hr, 0.72; ci, 0.54-0.97). light to moderate alcohol intake lowers the risk of cardiovascular mortality, but whether this protective effect can be attributed to a specific type of beverage remains unclear. binge drinking may reduce telomere length. uncertainty remains about the overall survival benefit of alcohol consumption and the mechanisms underlying the cardioprotective effect of light to moderate alcohol intake. moderate drinking is associated with some health benefits, and can play a positive role in older people's social lives. the effects of heavy alcohol use on brain functioning closely resemble age-related changes, but it is not known if moderate-heavy alcohol consumption intensifies brain aging. moderate alcohol consumption (one to two drinks per day) has been associated with better cognitive function and lower risk of developing dementia in the elderly. light wine consumption was associated with 5 years longer life expectancy; however, more studies are needed to verify this result. the longevity observed with moderate alcohol consumption may be explained by other confounding factors, and, if such a relationship is present, the mechanism is not well understood. recent studies, however, have implied tht whilst moderate or high ingestion of alcohol may be detrimental, a threshold exists for alcohol consumption below which alcohol may even exert a beneficial effect. compared with never or occasional drinkers, subjects drinking 1 to 7 drinks per week had lower age-, sex-, and race-adjusted incidences of death (27.4 vs 20.1 per 1000 person-years, respectively) and cardiac events (28.9 vs 20.8 per 1000 person-years). there is evidence of a u-shaped association between alcohol consumption and physical health outcomes in older people, such that moderate drinking is associated with better outcomes than abstinence or heavy drinking, but whether moderate drinking in older people is associated with better cognition and mental health than non-drinking has not been explored. drinking alcohol in moderation is often considered a health-conscious behavior, associated with improved cardiovascular and brain health. in middle-aged and older men and women, moderate levels of alcohol consumption are associated with better cognitive health than abstinence. |||",Yes
Does marijuana use reduce the risk of developing diabetes?,Yes,"The evidence suggests that marijuana use is associated with an increased risk of prediabetes, but not with the development of diabetes by middle adulthood. Over 18 years of follow-up, a greater risk of prediabetes was found for individuals who reported a lifetime use of marijuana of 100 times or more, compared with individuals who had never used marijuana. After multivariable adjustment, higher odds of prediabetes were found for individuals who reported current use of marijuana and a lifetime use of 100 times or more, compared with individuals who reported never using marijuana. Although epidemiologic studies have found lower prevalence rates of obesity and diabetes mellitus in marijuana users compared with people who have never used marijuana, the relationship between cannabinoids and peripheral metabolic processes is not fully understood. In multivariable adjusted models, current marijuana use was associated with lower fasting insulin levels and lower homa-ir, but this does not necessarily translate to a reduced risk of developing diabetes.","the association between marijuana use and the prevalence of prediabetes and diabetes was examined in 3,034 participants at cardia examination year 25 (2010-2011), while the incidence of prediabetes and diabetes according to previous marijuana use was assessed in 3,151 individuals who were free from prediabetes/diabetes at year 7 (1992-1993) and who returned for at least one of the four subsequent follow-up examinations over 18 years. marijuana use in young adulthood is associated with an increased risk of prediabetes by middle adulthood, but not with the development of diabetes by this age. over 18 years of follow-up, a greater risk of prediabetes (but not diabetes) was found for individuals who reported a lifetime use of marijuana of 100 times or more (hr 1.39 [95% ci 1.13, 1.71]), compared with individuals who had never used marijuana. after multivariable adjustment, higher odds of prediabetes were found for individuals who reported current use of marijuana (or 1.65 [95% ci 1.15, 2.38]) and a lifetime use of 100 times or more (or 1.49 [95% ci 1.06, 2.11]), compared with individuals who reported never using marijuana. epidemiologic studies have found lower prevalence rates of obesity and diabetes mellitus in marijuana users compared with people who have never used marijuana, suggesting a relationship between cannabinoids and peripheral metabolic processes. in multivariable adjusted models, current marijuana use was associated with 16% lower fasting insulin levels (95% confidence interval [ci], -26, -6) and 17% lower homa-ir (95% ci, -27, -6). we found that marijuana use was associated with lower levels of fasting insulin and homa-ir, and smaller waist circumference. this study sought to clarify the cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between self-reported marijuana use, and prediabetes (defined as fasting glucose 5.6-6.9 mmol/l, 2 h glucose post ogtt 7.8-11.0 mmol/l or hba1c 5.7-6.4% [39-47 mmol/mol]) and diabetes. data from the community-based coronary artery risk development in young adults (cardia) study were used to determine marijuana use and the presence of prediabetes and diabetes among participants. to test the hypothesis that marijuana smoking significantly lowers the risk of developing cancer in humans, we analyzed published data from a prospective cohort study on cancer incidence among nonsmokers (ns), marijuana-only smokers (ms), tobacco-only smokers (ts), and marijuana and tobacco smokers (mts). results of previous studies indicate that marijuana could alleviate certain factors of metabolic syndrome, such as obesity. the purpose of this study is to assess whether marijuana use is associated with decreased odds of prescription opioid use. analyses suggest that for females (but not males) who used marijuana in adolescence, marijuana use increased the risk for subsequent daily smoking: or = 1.71, 95% ci = (1.13, 2.59). given the declining trend in adolescent cigarette smoking and increase in general access to marijuana, it is important to examine whether marijuana use in adolescence is a risk factor for subsequent cigarette smoking in late adolescence and early adulthood. we recommend that adolescent marijuana use be viewed as a possible risk factor for subsequent initiation of daily cigarette smoking in women. marijuana use among individuals with alcohol or other drug dependence is associated with a lower odds of achieving abstinence from drug and heavy alcohol use. marijuana use is associated with negative cognitive and health outcomes and risky driving. to date, no study has investigated the relationship between marijuana use and fasting insulin, glucose, and insulin resistance. using the log linear model to calculate the probability of developing each cancer form as a function of the interaction between marijuana and tobacco smoking, as well as functions of marijuana and tobacco smoking main effects whereby chi square statistics were calculated for the interaction and main effect estimates, we found that in all cases tested there was a significantly lower risk for ms compared to ts. in both study samples, marijuana use was associated with significantly increased odds of alcohol positivity. |||",Yes
Do fish oil capsules promote prostate cancer?,Yes,"The context suggests that fish and fish oil supplements, which are rich in n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), may not promote prostate cancer. In fact, epidemiological studies indicate that frequent consumption of fatty fish and marine fatty acids appears to reduce the risk of prostate cancer. This association is further modified by genetic variation in the COX-2 gene. Interventional studies using fish oil supplements in patients with prostate cancer showed no impact on prostate-specific antigen levels, but two studies showed a decrease in inflammatory or other cancer markers. Cohort studies assessing the risk of prostate cancer mortality suggested an association between higher intake of fish and decreased risk of prostate cancer-related death. In a double-blind placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial, men diagnosed with prostate cancer who consumed fish ≥5 times/week had a 48% lower risk of prostate cancer death than those consuming fish less than once weekly. Therefore, the claim that fish oil capsules promote prostate cancer is not supported by the provided context.","although fish and fish oil supplements have been touted for their many benefits, especially in the treatment of cardiovascular disease, recent headlines have suggested that they might be linked to an increased risk of prostate cancer. dietary intake of marine fatty acids from fish may protect against prostate cancer development. these results suggest that fish intake is unrelated to prostate cancer incidence but may improve prostate cancer survival. epidemiological studies suggest that fish consumption may be a protective factor against the development of prostate cancer. frequent consumption of fatty fish and marine fatty acids appears to reduce the risk of prostate cancer, and this association is modified by genetic variation in the cox-2 gene. dietary fatty acids may influence prostate carcinogenesis. our results suggest that consumption of preserved fish may reduce the risk of developing prostate cancer. we examined the relation of fish and seafood n-3 fatty acid intakes with prostate cancer incidence and mortality. fish and seafood n-3 fatty acids may prevent or delay the progression of prostate cancer, but epidemiologic studies do not uniformly support this hypothesis. taking dietary supplements, such as fish oil (fo), which is rich in n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (pufas), has been employed as a strategy to lower prostate cancer risk and control disease progression. we investigated the association between prostate cancer risk and fresh and preserved fish consumption among participants of a population-based case-control study (1,534 cases, 1,607 controls). the interventional studies using fish oil supplements in patients with prca showed no impact on prostate-specific antigen levels; however, 2 studies showed a decrease in inflammatory or other cancer markers. cohort studies assessing the risk of prca mortality suggested an association between higher intake of fish and decreased risk of prostate cancer-related death. we examined the effects of lycopene and fish oil on prostate gene expression in a double-blind placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial. survival analysis among the men diagnosed with prostate cancer revealed that those consuming fish >or=5 times/wk had a 48% lower risk of prostate cancer death than did men consuming fish less than once weekly [relative risk (rr) = 0.52; 95% ci: 0.30, 0.91; p for trend = 0.05]. we assessed dietary intake of fish among 1,499 incident prostate cancer cases and 1,130 population controls in sweden. eating fatty fish (e.g., salmon-type fish) once or more per week, compared to never, was associated with reduced risk of prostate cancer (or: 0.57, 95% ci: 0.43-0.76). the aim of our study was to investigate the association between these fatty acids and the subsequent risk of prostate cancer. eighty-four men with low risk prostate cancer were stratified based on self-reported dietary consumption of fish and tomatoes and then randomly assigned to a 3-month intervention of lycopene (n = 29) or fish oil (n = 27) supplementation or placebo (n = 28). multiplicative and additive interactions between fish intake and cox-2 snps on prostate cancer risk were evaluated. |||",Yes
Are movement exercises useful for back pain?,Yes,"The systematic review investigated the effect of movement-based interventions on movement patterns of people with low back pain and the relationship between changes in movement patterns and subsequent changes in pain and activity limitation. The review found that exercise interventions, including back extension exercises, lumbar muscle stabilisation exercises, and back endurance-resistance exercises, may be effective at reducing pain or disability in patients with low back pain. Stabilization exercises for patients with low back pain may help to decrease pain and disability. A relationship between changes to movement patterns and improvements in pain or activity limitation was observed in several studies. Specific lumbar strengthening showed clinically relevant improvements in pain and disability in patients with persistent chronic low back pain. Therefore, movement exercises are useful for back pain.","the objective of this systematic review was to investigate: (i) the effect of movement-based interventions on movement patterns (muscle activation, lumbo-pelvic kinematics or postural patterns) of people with low back pain (lbp), and (ii) the relationship between changes in movement patterns and subsequent changes in pain and activity limitation. health care providers often prescribe exercises as treatment for nonspecific low back pain. current evidence suggests that exercise interventions may be effective at reducing pain or disability in patients with low back pain. back extension exercises are often used in the rehabilitation of low back pain. recent evidence suggests that interventions based on lumbar muscle stabilisation exercises (lmse) and back endurance-resistance exercises (bere) may improve back pain and function performance. therapeutic exercises are frequently prescribed to patients with low back pain. to investigate the effectiveness of exercises for preventing new episodes of low-back pain or low-back pain-associated disability. exercise has long been a standard of treatment for back pain. numerous exercise programs for patients with low back pain have been described. stabilization exercises for patients with low back pain may help to decrease pain and disability. the exercises aimed at improving lumbar mobility in the transverse plane. to assess the feasibility of such an approach to the low back strain syndrome, a program of therapeutic exercises with and without the addition of heat and massage was employed for the treatment of this condition. the prescription of exercise as a conservative treatment for lumbar pain is frequent and seems effective for the chronic cases of nonspecific low back pain. it is unclear if exercises, either as part of treatment or as a post-treatment programme, can reduce back pain recurrences. a relationship between changes to movement patterns and improvements in pain or activity limitation was observed in one of six studies on muscle activation patterns, one of four studies that examined the flexion relaxation response pattern and in two of three studies that assessed lumbo-pelvic kinematics or postural characteristics. therefore, this study assesses effectiveness of massage therapy and abdominal hypopressive gymnastics and the combination of both to decrease pain and lumbar disability while increasing joint mobility and quality of life in patients with chronic nonspecific low back pain. over the last 2 decades, the use of intense, non-pain-contingent exercises for treatment of chronic back pain has received increased advocacy. it is assumed that low back pain patients who use pain-avoiding immobilizing strategies may benefit from specific back flexion and extension exercises aimed at reducing sagittal lumbar hypomobility. our objective was to compare the effectiveness of 2 home exercise programs in decreasing disability and pain related to subacute and chronic nonspecific low back pain. specific lumbar strengthening showed clinically relevant improvements in pain and disability in patients with persistent chronic low back pain. |||",Yes
"Is the Gynefix® contraceptive necklace as effective for contraception as the birth control pill or the ""IUD""?",Yes,"The provided context does not include information on the Gynefix® contraceptive necklace, making it impossible to directly compare its efficacy to that of the birth control pill or the IUD. However, the context does provide information on the high efficacy of both copper-containing and hormonal IUDs as long-acting, reversible contraceptive methods. The copper IUD is noted as the most effective form of emergency contraception and a highly effective, reversible, long-acting, hormone-free method for women with a history of hormonally mediated cancer. The levonorgestrel-releasing IUD is also highly effective, with the potential to reduce the rate of pelvic inflammatory disease and ectopic pregnancy compared to other copper-releasing IUDs. Both types of IUDs are widely used and considered safe and effective forms of contraception.","the iud is a convenient and effective contraceptive option for many women. the intrauterine contraceptive device (iud) is a highly effective and safe form of reversible contraception. modern intrauterine devices (iuds) provide effective, safe and long-term contraception and could be recommended to most women. copper-containing and hormonal intrauterine devices (iud) are long-acting, highly effective contraceptive methods. the copper intrauterine device is the most effective form of emergency contraception and can also provide long-term contraception. the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine device (lng iud) provides excellent contraception; it may reduce the rate of pelvic inflammatory disease (pid) and ectopic pregnancy compared to other 'modern' copper releasing iuds; it can safely be used in the puerperium for breast-feeding mothers, and it significantly reduces menstrual blood loss and pain. an intrauterine contraceptive device (iud) is a long acting, highly effective, economic and reversible method of contraception used worldwide. the contraceptive efficacy of intrauterine devices (iud) is thought to relate to the position of the iud in the uterine cavity. this paper reviews the evidence supporting the safety and efficacy of available methods of contraception for cancer survivors and concludes that the copper t380a intrauterine device (iud), a highly effective, reversible, long-acting, hormone-free method should be considered a first-line contraceptive option for women with a history of a hormonally mediated cancer. although the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine device (lng-iud) is one of the most reliable methods of contraception, it is associated with an increased risk of ectopic pregnancy in case of unintended pregnancy. does the efficacy of placing a copper intrauterine device (iud) for emergency contraception (ec) to prevent pregnancy depend on menstrual cycle timing and timing of unprotected intercourse (upi)? the cu-iud is more effective for ec than hormonal pills but remains underused, possibly because of lack of knowledge or interest. over 1 year, the copper intrauterine device is currently the most cost-effective emergency contraception option. the intrauterine device (iud), primarily in the form of the copper iud, is used by more than 150 million women around the world, making it the most widely used reversible method of contraception. it is concluded from this study that copper-t is a highly effective method of contraception than cu 375 iucd with good patient acceptance and lesser side effects. of emergency contraceptive methods available in the united states, the copper intrauterine device has the highest efficacy, followed by ulipristal acetate, levonorgestrel-containing emergency contraceptive pills, and the yuzpe method. the intrauterine device (iud) and intrauterine system (ius) are widely used forms of long-acting reversible contraception. over 50% were aware that the cu-iud is hormone-free and may be used for long-term contraception. however, the levonorgestrel-containing iud may be preferable for women being treated with tamoxifen and women who have survived non-hormonally mediated cancers. a greater understanding of the benefits and limitations of these two contraceptive options will assist women's health care providers to better meet the family planning needs of their patients. |||",Yes
Is there an increased risk of long-term effects on the unborn child with chemotherapy starting in the 2nd trimester of pregnancy?,Yes,"Justification: The provided context indicates that chemotherapy administered during the first trimester of pregnancy results in increased congenital malformations. However, the risk of fetal malformations when chemotherapy is administered during the second and third trimesters is probably not greater than the background rate. The context also mentions that it is still unclear whether late adverse effects arise if a child is exposed to chemotherapy in utero. Therefore, there is not enough information to definitively state whether there is an increased risk of long-term effects on the unborn child with chemotherapy starting in the 2nd trimester of pregnancy.","an important concern is the potential impact of chemotherapy on the developing fetus. chemotherapy administered during first trimester of pregnancy results in increased congenital malformations (7.5 - 17% compared to 4.1 - 6.9% background risk), whereas normal rates are found during second or third trimester. the authors review the available literature on neonatal and long-term outcome of children prenatally exposed to chemotherapy. introduction cancers during pregnancy can be treated with chemotherapy after the first trimester but the treatment is associated with smaller placentas and an increased risk of stillbirth, fetal growth retardation and preterm delivery. chemotherapy given during pregnancy is associated with several maternal-fetal complications, including risks for mutagenicity, myelosuppression, and fetal death. the risk of fetal malformations when chemotherapy is administered during the second and third trimesters is probably not greater than the background rate. chemotherapy administration in the first trimester is generally not recommended due the potential risks to the fetus including fetal death and major congenital malformations. when chemotherapy is used during embryogenesis, there is an increased rate of spontaneous abortions and major birth defects. systemic antineoplastic chemotherapy given to a pregnant women at this time may involve fetal risk of abortion, death, stunting, malformation, and systemic toxicity. however, investigators caution that fetal damage, including genetic impairment resulting from chemotherapy throughout pregnancy, may ot appear until much later in life. chemotherapy during pregnancy carries the risk of teratogenic effects on the fetus, and there is little data to guide chemotherapeutic regimens for leukemia during pregnancy. the decision to use chemotherapy significantly impacts the pregnancy, and in turn the pregnancy may affect the treatment options available to patients with cancer. during pregnancy, the need for maternal chemotherapy for breast carcinoma must be balanced against the fetal risk because modification of cancer therapy to assure the birth of a healthy infant may affect maternal prognosis adversely. pregnancy during cancer treatment is strongly discouraged, as radiotherapy and chemotherapy administered during the first trimester of pregnancy result in increased congenital malformations. chemotherapy may be indicated for the treatment of cancer during pregnancy. it is still unclear whether these late adverse effects also arise if a child is exposed to chemotherapy in utero. due to the increasing incidence of cancer during pregnancy, the need to better understand long-term outcome after prenatal exposure to chemo- and/or radiotherapy has become more urgent. cancer treatment during childhood may lead to late adverse effects, such as reduced musculoskeletal development or vascular, endocrine and pulmonary dysfunction, which in turn may have an adverse effect on later pregnancy and childbirth. exposure of the fetus to transplacental chemotherapy must be considered when evaluating therapy options and timing of delivery in hematologic malignancies diagnosed during pregnancy. two pregnancies that were exposed to chemotherapy during the first trimester resulted in spontaneous abortion. |||",Yes
Can regular screening significantly reduce the risk of dying from prostate cancer?,No,"The evidence from screening trials suggests a small but finite benefit from prostate cancer screening in terms of prostate cancer-specific mortality, with approximately 1 fewer prostate cancer death per 1000 men screened over 10 years. The European Randomised Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC) showed that prostate-specific antigen (PSA) based screening results in a significant prostate cancer mortality reduction. The implementation of PSA screening has coincided with a decrease in mortality rate from prostate cancer. However, it is important to note that PSA screening can lead to overdiagnosis and overtreatment, which can have negative consequences for patients. Therefore, while regular screening can reduce the risk of dying from prostate cancer, it is important to weigh the potential benefits against the potential harms.","although a mortality reduction can be achieved by early detection of prostate cancer, patients and physicians must be aware of the current side effects of screening. early detection of prostate cancer through screening seems to provide the best hope of control or possibly cure of the disease. to date, there have been no randomised clinical trials which have demonstrated that screening for prostate cancer reduces mortality or increases life expectancy. prostate cancer screening with prostate specific antigen reduces prostate cancer mortality but leads to over diagnosis of indolent prostate cancer. prostate-specific antigen (psa) screening reduces prostate cancer deaths but leads to harm from overdiagnosis and overtreatment. biennial psa screening reduces the risk of being diagnosed with metastatic prostate cancer, the first prerequisite for achieving decreased cancer mortality in younger men. the aim of the present report is to evaluate whether psa-based screening reduces the risk of being diagnosed with metastatic prostate cancer. the best evidence from screening trials suggests a small but finite benefit from prostate cancer screening in terms of prostate cancer-specific mortality, about 1 fewer prostate cancer death per 1000 men screened over 10 years. the benefit of prostate-cancer screening compares favourably to other cancer screening programs. the benefits of population-based prostate cancer screening are the detection of clinically important prostate cancers at an early, still curable, stage and the subsequent reduction of prostate cancer-specific mortality. the implementation of prostate-specific antigen (psa) screening has coincided with a decrease in mortality rate from prostate cancer at the cost of overtreatment. the objective of the study is to see if screening with psa decreases mortality from prostate cancer. the european randomised study of screening for prostate cancer (erspc) showed that prostate-specific antigen (psa) based screening results in a significant prostate cancer mortality reduction. there is no available evidence from randomized trials that early detection of prostate cancer improves health outcomes, but the prostate-specific antigen (psa) test is commonly used to screen men for prostate cancer. more than any other cancer, prostate cancer screening with the prostate-specific antigen (psa) tests increases the risk a man will have to face a diagnosis of prostate cancer. a contemporary review of literature with respect to low-risk prostate cancer and active surveillance was conducted. this article reviews current research into active surveillance in favourable-risk disease and some of the issues that arise when prostate cancer is monitored rather than being treated immediately. with the widespread acceptance of prostate-specific antigen screening, a greater proportion of men are being diagnosed with clinically localized prostate cancer. randomized controlled trials are currently conducted to assess whether the mortality from prostate cancer is reduced by early detection with the use of prostate-specific antigen (psa) measurements in serum. however, several recent reports have demonstrated that the death rate from prostate cancer is decreasing, representing the most compelling validation for aggressive screening. |||",No
Can a treatment with singing bowls relieve pain?,No,"The evidence from peer-reviewed studies suggests that singing bowl therapies may have positive health effects, including pain reduction. In one study, both singing and painting interventions led to significant pain reduction in patients with chronic pain. However, due to the limited number of studies and potential methodological biases, further research is needed to make evidence-based recommendations for the use of singing bowl therapies in pain management.","the effects of singing bowls on human health were investigated in four peer-reviewed studies, one of which investigated patients with metastatic cancer, and another those with chronic spinal pain. studies of any intervention predominantly involving singing bowls (e.g. the objective of this study was to determine the human health effects (beneficial or adverse) of any singing bowl therapies. as the evidence suggests positive health effects, we recommend that future studies consider the effect of singing bowl therapies using more robust study methods, allowing for evidence-based recommendations to be made to reduce the disease burden. playing singing bowls, listening to singing bowls) were eligible for inclusion. findings suggest that singing and painting interventions may reduce pain and improve mood, quality of life, and cognition in patients with mild ad, with differential effects of painting for depression and singing for memory performance. among non-pharmacological therapies, musical intervention is often used for patients with alzheimer's disease (ad) and patients presenting chronic pain. our aim was to determine the efficacy of choral singing versus painting sessions on chronic pain, mood, quality of life, and cognition in ad patients. both singing and painting interventions led to significant pain reduction (time effect: f = 4.71; p = 0.01), reduced anxiety (time effect: f = 10.74; p < 0.0001), improved quality of life (time effect: f = 6.79; p = 0.002), improved digit span (f = 12.93; p = 0.001), and inhibitory processes (time effect: f = 4.93; p = 0.03). moderate singing activities and breathing exercises seem to be helpful in avoiding reflux symptoms such as heartburn and acid regurgitation. given there were few studies and the potential risk of methodological bias, we cannot recommend singing bowl therapies at this stage. abdominal muscle support is essential for singing. pilot data suggest online group singing for people with copd may deliver benefits related to reducing depression and improved balance confidence. this indicates that this music therapy approach applied in an initial stage of tinnitus can make an important contribution towards preventing tinnitus from becoming a chronic condition. forty-six patients were randomly assigned to receive analgesics and fiber supplement alone (control patients) or a twice-daily sitz bath along with identical fiber and analgesics (sitz bath group). in the present study a music therapeutic intervention according to the 'heidelberg model' was evaluated as a complementary treatment option for patients with acute tinnitus whom medical treatment only brought minimal or no improvement. the influence of singing activities and breathing exercises on the presence of gastroesophageal reflux disease (gerd) symptoms is not clear. the results provide the first evidence that singing and rhythmic speech may be similarly effective in the treatment of non-fluent aphasia. the device that has been developed has restored his ability to support singing and has improved respiratory function substantially. singing for lung health (slh) is a popular arts-in-health activity for people with long-term respiratory conditions. |||",No
"Is the HIV saliva self-test, which is about to be approved in the U.S., as reliable as a laboratory test or a rapid test at the doctor's office?",Yes,"The HIV saliva self-test, which is about to be approved in the U.S., has been shown to have a high rate of accuracy and reliability in various studies. The test has demonstrated a comparable rate of accuracy to blood-based tests, with a correct interpretation rate of 83.8% for the oral-fluid test versus 84.4% for the blood test. The practicability and accuracy of the saliva self-test have been evaluated and compared to the capillary blood self-test, with both tests showing high rates of successful performance. The anti-HIV test strip methodology for saliva specimens is rapid, reliable, and easy to perform and interpret. The use of saliva as a diagnostic medium for the detection of HIV antibodies has been evaluated and found to be of sufficient sensitivity and specificity to make this protocol useful in epidemiological studies. Therefore, it can be concluded that the HIV saliva self-test is as reliable as a laboratory test or a rapid test at the doctor's office.","saliva rapid point of care hiv tests have proven advantages over blood-based hiv tests in terms of quality, rapidity and convenience. these results support previous data showing that in some situations saliva might be an effective alternative to serum for hiv testing. our field observations demonstrate that blood-based and oral-fluid-based hivst are both practicable approaches with a high and comparable rate of accuracy in the study setting. saliva samples can be used as a substitute to serum/whole blood for hiv testing. therefore, saliva has been recommended as a non invasive, safe and effective alternative to serum, for hiv antibody testing. the rate of correct interpretation of the hiv self-test results was 84.4% with the blood test versus 83.8% with the oral-fluid test (difference = 0.6; 95% ci: -0.2 to 1.7; p = 0.425). results from this study demonstrate the utility and acceptability of the rapid finger-stick test for hiv antibody among women in northern thailand. our study demonstrates that 'whole saliva' specimens are a good alternative to blood samples in epidemiological studies of hiv prevalence in high-risk groups. the practicability and accuracy of and the preference for the capillary blood self-test (exacto test hiv) versus the oral fluid self-test (oraquick hiv self-test) were compared among untrained individuals in the democratic republic of the congo (drc). the anti-hiv test strip methodology for whole blood and saliva specimens is rapid, reliable and easy to perform and interpret. research is underway to develop a low-cost saliva assay, thus saliva could become the hiv antibody testing medium of choice for much of the developing countries. to evaluate the use of saliva specimens for the detection of hiv antibodies among high-risk groups in epidemiological studies. the rate of successful performance of the hiv self-tests was high, with the blood test (99.6%) and the oral-fluid test (99.4%) yielding an absolute difference of 0.2% (95% ci: -1.8 to 1.1; p = 0.568). we conclude that hiv-1 antibody testing of saliva samples collected with this device and tested by this eia is of sufficient sensitivity and specificity to make this protocol useful in epidemiological studies. although whole blood rapid hiv testing has a greater sensitivity and specificity compared with oral fluid (of) testing, patients prefer hiv testing using of specimen collection. this study was performed to determine the feasibility of using saliva as a diagnostic medium for the detection of antibodies to human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1) and hiv-2 under nonlaboratory conditions and to evaluate the performance characteristics of such a test. this study was performed to evaluate the performance of a saliva collection device (omnisal) and an enzyme-linked immunoassay (eia) designed for use on serum samples (detect hiv1/2) to detect human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1) antibodies in the saliva of high-risk women in mombasa, kenya. the introduction of a rapid hiv test using a saliva sample in 2004 made immediate results possible in community-based settings. although use of rapid hiv antibody tests of finger-stick blood specimens could expand voluntary counseling and testing in areas where fear of venipuncture and delays in learning test results are barriers, there is little information on performance and acceptability of these tests in asia. the united states fda approved an over-the-counter hiv self-test, to facilitate increased hiv testing and earlier linkage to care. |||",Yes
"What are the advantages and disadvantages of vaccinating infants simultaneously with the usual six-dose vaccine (against diphtheria, tetanus, polio, pertussis, hepatitis B, and Haemophilus influenzae B) and a pneumococcal vaccine? (Reader inquiry)",Yes,"advantages of vaccinating infants simultaneously with the usual six-dose vaccine and a pneumococcal vaccine include reducing the number of injections given to young infants, improving vaccine delivery, and providing protection against multiple diseases in a timely and efficient manner. The disadvantages are not explicitly stated in the provided context, but potential disadvantages could include increased reactogenicity or adverse events due to the administration of multiple vaccines at once. However, the context suggests that the safety and immunogenicity of such combined vaccines have been demonstrated in various studies.","to assess whether the combination of a diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis vaccine with a haemophilus influenzae type b conjugate vaccine (prp-t) had any effect on immunogenicity or safety compared with separate administration of the vaccines, 158 infants were randomized to receive the vaccines either in association or as a combination at 2, 4, and 6 months of age. to study the safety and immunogenicity of a combined diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (dtp)-haemophilus influenzae type b (hboc) vaccine (tetramune) in infants as young as 2 months of age as compared to separate administration of dtp and hboc. to describe the immune response of preterm infants to combined diphtheria/tetanus/5 component acellular pertussis-haemophilus influenzae type b inactivated polio vaccine (dt5ap-hib-ipv) and meningococcal serogroup c conjugate vaccine (mcc) under accelerated schedule. healthy infants were randomized to receive a combination dtpa-hepb vaccine (diphtheria and tetanus toxoids, acellular pertussis antigens and hepatitis b surface antigen), concomitantly with type b and oral poliovirus vaccines at 2, 4 and 6 months of age (group 1) or hepb vaccine given at birth, 1 month and 6 months of age and dtpa, type b and oral poliovirus vaccines given at 2, 4 and 6 months of age (group 2). we assessed in young infants the safety and immunogenicity of two tetravalent vaccines containing pneumococcal 6b, 14, 19f and 23f polysaccharides conjugated to either tetanus toxoid (pnc-t) or diphtheria toxoid (pnc-d). a pentavalent combination vaccine, including a lyophilized haemophilus influenzae type b-tetanus toxoid conjugate vaccine reconstituted with a liquid diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis (pertussis toxoid and filamentous hemagglutinin) and inactivated polio vaccine (dtap-ipv/act-hib; pasteur mérieux connaught, lyon, france) was administered to 236 swedish infants either at 2, 4 and 6 months or at 3 and 5 months, and a booster dose was administered 7 months after the last primary dose. these results support the co-administration of dtap-ipv, mmr, and v vaccines in 4-6-year-old children, providing protection against multiple diseases in a timely and efficient manner. the objective of this study was to evaluate the immune response and reactogenicity of a combined hepatitis b, diphtheria, tetanus and whole-cell bordetella pertussis (dtpw-hbv) vaccine administered to healthy infants at 2, 4 and 6 months of age. to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of diphtheria-tetanus toxoids-acellular pertussis (dtpa)-hepatitis b (hepb) combination vaccine given at 2, 4 and 6 months of age compared with monovalent hepb vaccine given at birth, 1 month and 6 months of age and dtpa vaccine given at 2, 4 and 6 months of age. in a comparative trial, 94 preterm infants between 24 and 36 weeks (mean +/- sd gestational age: 31.05 +/- 3.45 weeks; mean birth weight: 1420 +/- 600 g) and a control group of 92 full-term infants were enrolled to receive 3 doses of a dtpa-hbv-ipv/hib vaccine at 2, 4, and 6 months. healthy infants, aged 46-74days (n=350), were randomised in a ratio of 1:1 to receive dtap-ipv-hb-prp-t vaccine at two, three and four months, either with a menc vaccine co-administered at two and four months (group 1;

Can phthalates cause diabetes?,Yes,"Epidemiological studies have found a correlation between circulating phthalate levels and type 2 diabetes. Phthalates, such as di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), have been shown to cause adverse effects on glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity in several cell models and epidemiological studies. Animal studies have also indicated that phthalates are capable of disrupting endocrine signaling, which can impact glucose homeostasis. However, direct evidence supporting a causal role for exposure to phthalates in type 2 diabetes is lacking. Nonetheless, human exposure to phthalates is associated with increased oxidative stress, which mediates the development of type 2 diabetes. Therefore, it is plausible that phthalates may contribute to the development of diabetes.","recent epidemiological studies have found a correlation between circulating phthalate levels and type 2 diabetes, whereas animal studies indicate that phthalates are capable of disrupting endocrine signaling. epidemiologic studies suggest phthalate metabolite concentrations are associated with type 2 diabetes. human exposure to phthalates is ubiquitous and has received considerable attention due to their association with adverse health outcomes, including type 2 diabetes mellitus (t2dm). epidemiological studies suggest a positive relationship between phthalate exposure and diabetes. this study indicates that exposure to phthalates gives rise to a brief interference of glucose homeostasis but has little impact on the development of type 2 diabetes and atherosclerosis in apoe(-/-) mice. phthalate plasticizers used in a wide range of common plastic products are released into the environment and may pose a risk of increased incidence of type 2 diabetes. epidemiological studies have associated serum or urinary phthalate metabolites with the prevalence of type 2 diabetes or related phenotypes. bisphenol a (bpa) and phthalates are common environmental contaminants that have been proposed to influence incidence and development of types 1 and 2 diabetes. the most frequently occurring phthalate, di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (dehp), causes adverse effects on glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity in several cell models and epidemiological studies. however, direct evidence supporting a causal role for exposure to phthalates in type 2 diabetes is lacking. our study suggests that human exposure to phthalates is associated with increased oxidative stress which mediates the development of t2dm. phthalates are suspected to act as endocrine modulators in humans and exert reproductive toxicity. insulin tolerance test on non-fasted mice 3 weeks after treatment revealed that phthalate had little influence on insulin sensitivity though phthalate-treated mice had a higher glucose concentration (159.2 ± 6.0 vs. 145.2 ± 3.6 mg/dl; p = 0.086). two weeks after treatment, phthalate-exposed mice had significantly higher fasting blood glucose level (97.9 ± 2.1 vs. 84.3 ± 5.3 mg/dl, p = 0.034) and exhibited a trend of increased glucose intolerance compared to control mice. epidemiological studies suggest that phthalate exposure is associated with development or worsening of allergic diseases such as asthma. however, little is known about the impact of dibutyl phthalate (dbp) exposure on the development of diabetes. to determine the potential influence of phthalates on glucose homeostasis and atherosclerosis, female apolipoprotein e-deficient (apoe(-/-)) mice were started at 6 weeks of age on a western diet together with or without bis-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate. little is known about phthalates and gdm risk factors (i.e. phthalate exposure may induce reproductive toxicity, liver damage, and carcinogenesis in humans. higher exposure to mono-ethyl phthalate, a metabolite of the parent compound of di-ethyl phthalate, may be associated with excessive gwg and impaired glucose tolerance; higher di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate was associated with reduced odds of impaired glucose tolerance. |||",Yes
"Can exercise prevent premature deaths from heart attacks, strokes, heart failure, and pre-diabetes as effectively as medication?",Yes,"Justification: The provided context suggests that exercise can effectively prevent premature deaths from heart attacks, strokes, heart failure, and pre-diabetes. Exercise has been shown to improve cardiovascular efficiency, arrest or reverse atherosclerosis, and reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease, obesity, and diabetes. Exercise is also known to lower the risk for cardiovascular disease and mortality. Although there are limited clinical data to support the use of exercise training as a means to reduce mortality and morbidity in patients with heart failure, current guidelines state that exercise is beneficial. Exercise is one of the commonly recommended interventions/preventions for hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and cardiovascular disease. However, it is important to note that exercise can cause sudden cardiac death in patients with pre-existing cardiac conditions. Therefore, it is recommended that patients with pre-existing cardiac conditions consult with their healthcare provider before starting an exercise program.","increased exercise capacity is associated with lower mortality risk, but little is known about its effects in prehypertensives. although it is recognized that moderate intensity long-term exercise can decrease the chances of dying from cardiovascular disease by favorably modifying risk factors such as hypertension, obesity, hyperlipidemia, and insulin resistance, physical activity also enhances longevity by mechanisms independent of these risk factors. exercise is effective in both preventing and treating coronary artery disease (cad). a strong, inverse and graded association between exercise capacity and all-cause mortality was observed in prehypertensive individuals. thus, we evaluated the association between exercise capacity and all-cause mortality in prehypertensives. exercise is becoming more widely used to prevent and treat the diseases that are most prevalent in the united states: coronary artery disease, stroke, hypertension, diabetes, arthritis, osteoporosis, dyslipidemia, obesity, depression, cancer, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. prevention of sudden cardiac arrest/death and disease progression has traditionally been the primary basis for determining exercise recommendations for those with underlying cardiovascular disease. our objective is to assess the beneficial and harmful effects of adding exercise to usual care for people with hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus and/or cardiovascular disease. this paper reviews the supportive evidence for this stance as well as the role of exercise in managing the major chd risk factors of atherogenic serum lipids, hypertension, and obesity. exercise improves cardiovascular efficiency and, in combination with other measures such as medication use, diet changes, and smoking cessation, may arrest or reverse atherosclerosis. physical exercise is an effective lifestyle intervention to reduce the risk factors for cardiovascular disease and also to improve cardiac function and survival in patients with ischemic heart disease. when executed properly, exercise can maintain and improve health and reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease, obesity, and diabetes. exercise may prevent or reduce the effects of metabolic and cardiovascular diseases, including arterial hypertension. exercise is universally known to benefit health by lowering risk for cardiovascular disease and mortality. exercise is one of the commonly recommended interventions/preventions for hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease. cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in developed nations, and there is a clear link between cardiovascular disease and physical inactivity. although there are limited clinical data to support the use of exercise training as a means to reduce mortality and morbidity in patients with heart failure, current guidelines state that exercise is beneficial. to date, limited treatment options exist for the treatment of heart failure, but exercise has been well-established as one of the few safe and effective interventions, leading to improved outcomes in patients. recognition of exercise as a lifestyle behavior is addressed and recommendations for prescribing exercise for adults interested in preventing chd are presented. however, in patients with pre-existing cardiac conditions, including channelopathies, cardiomyopathies and coronary artery disease, exercise can cause sudden cardiac death (scd). |||",Yes
Is the success of conventional treatment of a herniated disc equivalent to that of disc surgery?,Yes,"The success of conventional treatment of a herniated disc is not equivalent to that of disc surgery. While complete improvement can occur with nonoperative treatment, the standard treatment for lumbar disc herniation is lumbar disc removal. Conservative discectomy has been shown to result in a higher incidence of recurrent disc herniation, although it may result in shorter operative time, quicker return to work, and a decreased incidence of long-term recurrent low back pain. The prevailing percutaneous treatment options for herniated non-contained lumbar discs have not reliably achieved the same good results as the conventional microsurgical techniques. Clinical results in patients reoperated on for contralateral recurrent lumbar disc herniation compare favorably with those reported after primary discectomy.","to assess whether the clinical results in patients undergoing surgery for contralateral recurrent disc herniation may be as good as those reported after primary discectomy. although surgery is often recommended as the definitive treatment for radiculopathy when definite disc herniation is demonstrated with imaging techniques, complete improvement can occur with nonoperative treatment. the aim of the present study is to evaluate and compare the effectiveness of surgical and nonsurgical treatment in two trials - including disc herniation and spondylosis, respectively, and to evaluate factors that contribute to better decision making. both med and open discectomy can effectively improve single-segment lumbar disc herniation, but med is associated with less trauma, less bleeding, and a lower incidence of complications. there is fair quality evidence that conservative discectomy will result in a higher incidence of recurrent disc herniation. lumbar disc removal is currently the standard treatment for lumbar disc herniation. the effects of disc herniation morphology and preoperative variables on subsequent clinical outcome were determined with the student t test for continuous variables and chi-square analysis for categorical variables. to explore the surgical techniques of transforaminal endoscopic discectomy in treating central disc herniation and the clinical outcome based on 2-year follow-up. it remains unknown whether aggressive disc removal with curettage versus conservative removal of a disc fragment with little disc invasion provides a better outcome for the treatment of lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy. we reviewed the literature to determine whether outcomes reported after limited discectomy (ld) differed from those reported after aggressive discectomy (ad) with regard to long-term back pain or recurrent disc herniation. however, systematic review of the literature suggests that conservative discectomy may result in shorter operative time, quicker return to work, and a decreased incidence of long-term recurrent low back pain but with an increased incidence of recurrent disc herniation. the prevailing percutaneous treatment options for herniated non-contained lumbar discs have not reliably achieved the same good results as the conventional microsurgical techniques. the purpose of the present study was to determine if competence of the disc anulus and the type of herniation could be used to predict postoperative clinical outcomes following lumbar discectomy. the application of novel surgical techniques can help improve the safety and efficacy of transforaminal endoscopic discectomy in treating central disc herniations. we report the first prospective study in subjects with proven radiculopathy and definite disc herniation who improve with nonoperative management to determine what occurs to the herniated disc material. it remains unknown whether aggressive disc removal with curettage or limited removal of disc fragment alone with little disc invasion provides a better outcome for the treatment of lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy. although open laminotomy remains an acceptable and, at times, necessary method of treatment for herniated intervertebral discs, spinal stenosis, and various intracanal spinal disorders, arthroscopic disc surgery is emerging as an alternative method of treatment for contained and nonmigrated sequestered herniated discs. clinical results in patients reoperated on for contralateral recurrent lumbar disc herniation compare favorably with those reported after primary discectomy. the purpose of this study was to compare the outcome of revision lumbar discectomy with that of primary discectomy in the same cohort of patients who had both the primary and the recurrent herniation at the same level and side.a retrospective analysis of prospectively gathered data was undertaken in 30 patients who had undergone both primary and revision surgery for late recurrent lumbar disc herniation. operative time, return to work status, recurrent disc herniation, self-reported, and functional measures assessed less than 2 years (short term) and greater than 2 years (long term) after surgery. |||",Yes
Does regular use of sleeping pills promote the risk of death or cancer?,Yes,"The context suggests that regular use of sleeping pills is associated with an increased risk of death and cancer. Multiple studies have found that habitual sleeping pill usage is related to death from cancer, and sedative drug use is associated with a significant increase in mortality risk. The most important risks of hypnotics include excess mortality, infections, cancer, and other undesirable outcomes. The high prevalence of sleeping medication use in older cohorts is a significant public health concern. The context also indicates that poor subjective sleep quality is associated with increased risk for death by suicide, and shorter duration of sleep significantly increases the risk of colorectal adenomas.","for example, multiple studies have found that habitual sleeping pill usage is related to death from cancer, suggesting that sleep derangement may increase cancer mortality. disrupted sleep has been associated with increased risk of certain cancers. proper sleep is associated with reduced cancer risk. sedative drug use is associated with a small but significant increase in mortality risk. alterations in endocrine function, perhaps abnormal cortisol metabolism resulting from deranged sleep, may be in part responsible for the increased all-cancer mortality we report here. the serious problem of long-term prescription to medication can lead to a higher mortality rate of insomniac patients. a deviant habitual sleep duration, sleep complaints, frequent napping and snoring have all been suggested as potential risk factors for future coronary heart disease. however, other studies have not found a definite connection between sleep and cancer deaths. however, little is known about how habitual sleep duration (a known cardiometabolic risk factor) may affect the relationship between cancer and diabetes. the most important risks of hypnotics include excess mortality (especially overdose deaths, quiet deaths at night, and suicides), infections, cancer, depression, automobile crashes, falls, other accidents, and hypnotic-withdrawal insomnia. although widely used in the general population, sleeping pills and minor tranquilizers, also known as antianxiety agents, have been associated with undesirable outcomes. the authors' results suggest sleep duration as a novel risk factor for colorectal neoplasia. self-reported sleep disturbances may confer elevated risk for suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, and death. it was hypothesized that anxiolytic and hypnotic drug use would be associated with an elevated mortality hazard. amid fears about the medicalisation of old age, the high prevalence of sleeping medication use in older cohorts is a significant public health concern. data were analyzed to assess the moderating effect of short and long sleep durations on cancer and diabetes mellitus. our results indicate that poor subjective sleep quality is associated with increased risk for death by suicide 10 years later, even after adjustment for depressive symptoms. the association of insufficient sleep every day in the preceding 30 days with all-cancer mortality was significant (p = 0.017), independent of the percentage obese (p < 0.001), and unrelated to percentage white population (p = 0.847). shorter duration of sleep significantly increases risk of colorectal adenomas. controlling for depressive symptoms, baseline self-reported sleep quality was associated with increased risk for death by suicide (or, 1.30; 95% ci, 1.04-1.63; p < .05). |||",Yes
Does increased time outdoors inhibit myopia in children?,Yes,"Justification: Recent epidemiological evidence suggests that children who spend more time outdoors are less likely to be, or to become myopic. A significant protective effect of outdoor time was found for incident myopia and prevalent myopia. Increased time outdoors is effective in preventing the onset of myopia as well as in slowing the myopic shift in refractive error. Outdoor time is considered to reduce the risk of developing myopia, and more time outdoors is associated with a lesser risk of myopia. Clinical trials are now underway to reduce the development of myopia in children by increasing the amount of time they spend outdoors.","in children, time spent outdoors has a protective effect against myopia development. recent epidemiologic studies have shown that children who spend a higher proportion of time outdoors are less likely to develop myopia. additional time spent outdoors across the 3 to 9 years age range was associated with a reduced incidence of myopia between ages 10 and 15 years. recent epidemiological evidence in children indicates that time spent outdoors is protective against myopia. from 3 years of age onward, greater time outdoors was associated with a reduced risk of incident myopia. there are some limited reports based on questionnaire data that suggest that outdoor activity decreases the risk of myopia in children and may offset the myopia risk associated with prolonged nearwork. exposure to sunlight has recently been postulated as responsible for the effect that more time spent outdoors protects children from myopia, while early life exposure to natural light was reported to be possibly related to onset of myopia during childhood. the current literature suggests that there is a link between myopia protection and spending time outdoors in children. time outdoors during childhood is negatively associated with incident myopia. recent epidemiological evidence suggests that children who spend more time outdoors are less likely to be, or to become myopic, irrespective of how much near work they do, or whether their parents are myopic. a significant protective effect of outdoor time was found for incident myopia (clinical trials: risk ratio (rr) = 0.536, 95% confidence interval (ci) = 0.338 to 0.850; longitudinal cohort studies: rr = 0.574, 95% ci = 0.395 to 0.834) and prevalent myopia (cross-sectional studies: or = 0.964, 95% ci = 0.945 to 0.982). our meta-analyses assess the benefit of outdoor activities on myopia onset and myopic shift among school-aged children reported in prospective intervention studies. time spent outdoors was predictive of incident myopia independently of physical activity level. increased time outdoors is effective in preventing the onset of myopia as well as in slowing the myopic shift in refractive error. according to research data from 13 studies of 15,081 children aged 4-14 at baseline, outdoor light exposure significantly reduced myopia incidence/prevalence (odds ratio [or] = 0.85, 95% confidence interval [ci]: 0.80-0.91, p < 0.00001; i2 = 90%), spherical equivalent refractive error (ser) by 0.15 d/year (0.09-0.27, p < 0.0001), and axial elongation by 0.08 mm/year (-0.14 to -0.02, p = 0.02). outdoor time is considered to reduce the risk of developing myopia. more time outdoors is associated with a lesser risk of myopia, but the underlying mechanism is unclear. the purpose of this study was to investigate the reduced risk of myopia development, myopic shift, and axial elongation with more outdoor activity time among school-aged children. irrespective of the mechanisms involved, clinical trials are now underway to reduce the development of myopia in children by increasing the amount of time they spend outdoors. time spent in ""sports/outdoor activity"" has shown a negative association with incident myopia during childhood. |||",Yes
Can over-the-counter combination medications help with tension headache and migraine better than medications containing only single active ingredients?,Yes,"The combination of acetylsalicylic acid, acetaminophen, and caffeine has been shown to be more efficacious and superior to monotherapy with the single substances of the combination in the treatment of migraine and tension-type headache. The use of other therapeutic approaches in combination with medications can increase the success of treatment for tension-type headaches. The combination of a triptan plus a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) has demonstrated better efficacy for the acute treatment of migraine. The proportion of headache episodes pain-free at 2 hours was significantly higher with the triple combination compared to acetaminophen and placebo. The combination of acetylsalicylic acid, acetaminophen, and caffeine is effective and well-tolerated in episodic tension-type headache and significantly superior to acetaminophen with regard to being pain-free at 2 hours, headache response at 2 hours, and ability to return to daily activities.","combining triptans with nsaid and other agents for the acute treatment of migraine suggests better outcome efficacy measures than the use of single agents. combining triptans with nsaid and other agents for the acute treatment of migraine suggests better outcome efficacy measures than the use of single agents. patients suffering from migraine or tension-type headache (tth) often treat their complaints with over-the-counter (otc) medications. in the treatment of migraine and tension-type headache, the combination of asa, acetaminophen, and caffeine has been shown to be more efficacious and superior to monotherapy with the single substances of the combination. while pharmacotherapy with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories (nsaids) and tricyclic antidepressants comprises the traditional treatment of tension-type headaches (tth), the use of other therapeutic approaches in combination with medications can increase the success of treatment. most of these patients suffer from migraine, tension-type headache, or a combination of the two; they tend to self-medicate using over the counter combination headache preparations, particularly acetylsalicyclic acid (asa) and acetaminophen coformulated with caffeine, which is one of the most commonly used combination analgesics in these patients worldwide. recently, the role of combining agents for acute migraine treatment has gained attention and the combination of a triptan plus a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (nsaid) has demonstrated better efficacy. recently, the role of combining agents for the acute migraine treatment has gained attention and the combination of a triptan plus a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (nsaid) has demonstrated better efficacy. most patients with episodic tension-type headache treat headache episodes with over-the-counter medication. these results suggest that a combination of pharmacologic and behavioral treatment is more effective than drug therapy alone in the long-term management of transformed migraine with analgesic overuse. the proportion of headache episodes pain-free at 2 h was significantly higher with the triple combination (28.5%) vs. acetaminophen (21.0%) and placebo (18.0%) (p < 0.0001), and similarly for those severe at baseline (20.2% vs. 12.1% and 10.8%; p ≤ 0.0003). sixty-one consecutive patients with transformed migraine and analgesic overuse were treated with inpatient pharmacologic therapy alone or with inpatient pharmacologic therapy combined with biofeedback-assisted relaxation. the use of over-the-counter-medication in migraine treatment is commonplace. to determine whether combined treatment using medication and biofeedback would be more effective than drug treatment alone for treating transformed migraine complicated by analgesic overuse. the combination of acetylsalicylic acid, acetaminophen and caffeine is effective and well tolerated in episodic tension-type headache, and significantly superior to acetaminophen with regard to being pain-free at 2 h, headache response at 2 h and ability to return to daily activities, even in those with pain rated severe at baseline. patients with comorbid mood disorders and frequent headaches may particularly benefit from some nonpharmacologic approaches. this article focuses on the review of available literature for treating migraine attacks with two or more agents, related patents as well as analyzes the characteristics of the recently approved fixed combination sumatriptan-naproxen. this review focuses on the fundamentals of treating migraine attacks with two or more agents, and emphasizes the characteristics of the recently approved fixed combination sumatriptan-naproxen. a pubmed search using the terms ""migraine"", ""treatment"", ""acute"", ""triptans"", ""non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs"", ""sumatriptan"", ""naproxen"", and ""combination"" was used. the most effective medications for the acute treatment of migraine all have the capacity to induce medication overuse headache (moh). |||",Yes
Does hyperthermia treatment support chemotherapy in fighting cancer? (anonymous request with link to the Standard article),Yes,"Hyperthermia has been shown to support chemotherapy in fighting cancer. It is a noninvasive treatment that causes tumor cells to become heated, and it works in synergy with anticancer drugs and radiation therapy. Hyperthermia is used in cancer therapy, particularly in combination with systemic chemotherapy or radiotherapy. It has been found to potentiate the cytotoxicity of radiation and certain chemotherapy drugs, making it an attractive adjunctive modality in the treatment of cancer. Hyperthermia is currently being evaluated in clinical studies as a potential method of cancer treatment, and it has been shown to improve the efficacy of non-surgical methods of cancer treatment. In oncology, hyperthermia is used to treat malignant diseases by administering heat in various ways, and it has been found to enable tumor stroma to provide a sensitizing environment for tumor cells to undergo cell death. Hyperthermia is a promising treatment for human cervical cancer and has been used as an alternative to surgery or in combination with chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy in the treatment of oral squamous cell carcinoma.","hyperthermia, which is a noninvasive treatment that causes tumor cells to become heated and that works in synergy with anticancer drugs and radiation therapy, is emerging as a promising treatment for patients with cancer. hyperthermia is used in cancer therapy, however much remains to be discovered regarding its mechanisms of action at the cellular level. this subject seems to be worth studying, because hyperthermia can assist cancer therapy. regional hyperthermia has potential for human cancer treatment, particularly in combination with systemic chemotherapy or radiotherapy. hyperthermia is attractive as a potential adjunctive modality in the treatment of cancer, especially those cancers that are more resistant to conventional modalities. hyperthermia (ht) has been used as a possible treatment modality for various types of malignant tumors. hyperthermia is used in cancer treatment and potentiates the cytotoxicity of radiation and certain chemotherapy drugs. this poses questions about efficacy and optimal strategy for anti-cancer therapy combined with hyperthermia treatment. currently, whole-body and local hyperthermia is being evaluated in clinical studies as a potential method of cancer treatment. these findings support the use of hyperthermia in a clinical setting for the treatment of human cervical cancer. multimodal oncological strategies which combine chemotherapy or radiotherapy with hyperthermia, have a potential of improving the efficacy of the non-surgical methods of cancer treatment. in oncology, the term 'hyperthermia' refers to the treatment of malignant diseases by administering heat in various ways. these data present new aspects of hyperthermia in cancer treatment, suggesting that hyperthermia can enable tumor stroma provide a sensitizing environment for tumor cells to undergo cell death. hyperthermia is a promising treatment for human cervical cancer. hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (hipec) is proposed as a promising treatment method, but fundamental information about the contribution of hyperthermia to intraperitoneal chemotherapy is lacking. although the mechanism of hyperthermia in cancer treatment is well-known, there are few or no studies regarding the effect of hyperthermia on the tumor-supportive stroma. here, we investigated the effects of hyperthermia-treated mscs on the viability and growth of cancer cells. hyperthermia is usually applied as an adjunct to an already established treatment modality (especially radiotherapy and chemotherapy), where tumor temperatures in the range of 40-43 degrees c are aspired. hyperthermia, the procedure of raising the temperature of tumor-loaded tissue to 40 degrees -43 degrees c, has been applied to various established cancer treatments. hyperthermia is currently used as an alternative to surgery or in combination with chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy in the treatment of oral squamous cell carcinoma. |||",Yes
Can stress promote dementia?,Yes,"Justification: The context indicates that there is an association between stress and dementia, with previous studies suggesting that stress diagnoses increase the risk of dementia. Longstanding psychological stress has been associated with increased risk of neurodegenerative disorders, such as dementia and Alzheimer's disease. Chronic stress has been implicated in the etiology of Alzheimer's disease and is considered an important risk factor. The study provides evidence that chronic stress accelerates the onset and severity of cognitive deficits, indicating that chronic stress may be an important contributor to the onset and development of Alzheimer's disease.","there is an association between stress and dementia. objectives: previous studies indicated that stress diagnoses increase the risk of dementia. results support existing evidence of an association between stress and dementia. longstanding psychological stress has been associated with increased risk of neurodegenerative disorders, such as dementia and alzheimer's disease. psychological stress has previously been associated with higher risk of developing late-life dementia, especially alzheimer's disease (ad). in recent decades, biological evidence has implicated chronic stress in the etiology of alzheimer's disease (ad). stress is an important risk factor of alzheimer's disease (ad). adjustment for confounding only slightly attenuated the association, and reverse causation did not appear to bias the results substantially.conclusion: our results support the hypothesis that severe stress in midlife is an important risk factor for dementia. although chronic stress is known to be linked with memory and other neurological disorders, little is known about the relationship between chronic stress and the onset or development of alzheimer's disease (ad). stress may be a risk factor for dementia, however it is unknown whether post-traumatic stress disorder (ptsd) symptoms are associated with incident dementia in community-dwelling older individuals. this study provides the first evidence that chronic stress accelerates the onset and severity of cognitive deficits and that these are highly correlated with pathological changes, which thus indicates that chronic stress may be an important contributor to the onset and development of ad. therefore, the main aim of this study was to investigate the association between clinically diagnosed stress in midlife and later dementia risk, while addressing limitations of previous studies.methods: the study population was selected from all individuals in denmark born 1935-1956. this systematic review provided some non-robust, yet suggestive evidence that the above psychosocial types of stress are associated with increased risk of dementia in later life. the primary aim of this systematic review was to explore the association between psychosocial stress and late onset dementia. stress has deleterious effects on brain health and yet, the prognostic value of psychosocial stress regarding the most common types of dementias, including alzheimer disease, is still unclear. chronic stress is a major risk factor for developing alzheimer's disease (ad) and promotes the processing of amyloid precursor protein (app) to β-amyloid (aβ). mid-life psychological stress, psychosocial stress and post-traumatic stress disorder have been shown to cause cognitive dysfunction and lead to increased risk for dementia. epidemiological evidence implies a role for chronic stress and stress-related disorders in the etiopathogenesis of sporadic alzheimer's disease (ad). this study contributes novel information regarding dementia risk across a range of stress responses, and interactions between stress disorders and sex. an important factor that may affect the severity and time of onset of alzheimer's disease (ad) is chronic stress. |||",Yes
Are children conceived in May more likely to be born prematurely than children conceived in other months?,Yes,"The context does not provide specific information on the likelihood of preterm births based on the month of conception. However, it does mention that the mean month of conception was June, and that the uncertainty of due dates may influence the timing of birth. The context also highlights the risks associated with preterm births, including increased risk of underweight, stunting, and developmental delays. However, it does not provide a direct comparison between the likelihood of preterm births for children conceived in May and those conceived in other months. Therefore, based on the given context, it is not possible to conclude that children conceived in May are more likely to be born prematurely than children conceived in other months.","how women construct the uncertainty of their due dates may have implications for when and how women give birth. late preterm children grow faster than children born at term, but they are at increased risk of underweight and stunting in the first two years of life. this finding is at variance with the peak months of conception for the population of the united states for the years 1989 through 1993. the results suggest that women interpret the uncertainty of their due dates as a reason to wait for birth and as a reason to start the process early; however, information about a baby's brain development in the final weeks of pregnancy may persuade women to remain pregnant longer. the mean month of conception was june. months of the year were ascribed angle values and the distribution of conceptions per month were grouped in radial manner. preterm infants (those born at <37 completed weeks of gestation) are less likely to survive to their first birthday than infants delivered at higher gestational ages, and those who do survive, especially those born at the earlier end of the preterm spectrum, are more likely to suffer long-term disabilities than infants born at term. there was a slight excess of preterm deliveries. children born at <32 weeks' gestation are at increased risk of intellectual impairment. children born extremely premature (<28 weeks) or with a very low birth weight (<1500 g) have a poorer school performance than children born at term with a normal birth weight. very and moderately preterm children demonstrated significantly lower working memory scores compared with full-term children (adjusted difference -0.2 to -0.6) and were more likely to be delayed. children born from fresh in vitro fertilization (ivf) cycles are at greater risk of being born smaller and earlier, even when limited to singletons; those born from frozen cycles have an increased risk of large-for-gestational age (lga) birthweight (z-score ≥1.28). by its nature, the date that a baby is predicted to be born, or the due date, is uncertain. compared with children born at term, reading and spelling difficulties were more often found among children born at gestational age 33 to 36 weeks and 37 to 38 weeks, whereas there was no relation between gestational age and arithmetic difficulties. although children born very preterm (gestation <32 weeks) have an increased risk of cognitive impairment compared with full-term children (39-41 weeks), the risk for children born moderately (32-33 weeks) to late preterm (34-36 weeks) and early term (37-38 weeks) is unclear. parents of preterm children are more likely to adopt non-optimal parenting behaviors than parents of full-term (ft) children. children born moderately preterm (32-35(6/7) weeks' gestation) are at increased risk of both neonatal morbidities and developmental delays in early childhood. in the united states as many as 15% of births occur before 39 weeks because of elective inductions or cesarean sections, putting these babies at risk for increased medical problems after birth and later in life. infants in the premarital conception group were at increased risk because of maternal youth, primiparity and maternal health behaviour such as smoking. it is unknown whether neonatal morbidities contribute to the increased risk of developmental delay. |||",Yes
Does osteopathy work?,Yes,"There is growing evidence that osteopathy is effective in a range of clinical conditions, including pain and function in the musculoskeletal system, organs, and the head region, as well as functional somatic syndromes.

Osteopathic manipulative therapy has been reported to relieve a variety of conditions, and osteopathic manipulative therapy (manipulative care provided by foreign-trained osteopaths) is effective in managing pain caused by a variety of clinical conditions. However, more research is needed to fully understand the underlying biological basis of its therapeutic effects and to establish its cost-effectiveness compared with other treatment modalities.","while there is growing evidence that osteopathy is effective in a range of clinical conditions, the underlying biological basis of its therapeutic effects remain largely unknown. osteopathy is an increasingly popular health care modality to address pain and function in the musculoskeletal system, organs and the head region, as well as functional somatic syndromes. osteopathic medicine is based on a diagnostic and therapeutic system to treat tissue mobility/ motility dysfunctions in general, using different approaches (depending on the target tissue) known as osteopathic manipulative treatment. although osteopathic medicine has been well integrated into traditional health care systems in the united states, little is known about the role of osteopathy in traditional health care systems outside the united states. osteopathic medicine is a system of manual diagnosis and treatment. osteopathic care may support an individual's adaptive capacity, including allostatic regulation and tissue changes in both health and disease. though osteoporosis is a significant cause of disability worldwide, treatment with pharmacologic agents decreases risk of fragility fracture. osteopathic manipulative treatment has been reported to relieve a variety of conditions, but no studies have examined the outcome effects of osteopathic manipulative treatment as a complementary modality for treating musculoskeletal problems during postoperative recovery. despite the value that osteopathic manipulative medicine (omm) may offer to healthcare consumers in a managed care, evidence-based healthcare system, very little research has been published on the cost-effectiveness of osteopathic manipulative treatment compared with other treatment modalities. though these treatments act through the bone remodeling system to improve bone mass, it is unclear if they alter the response of bone to mechanical loading at the level of the osteocyte. osteopathic manipulative therapy (omth; manipulative care provided by foreign-trained osteopaths) is effective in managing pain caused by a variety of clinical conditions. research on the effect of osteopathic manipulative therapy (omth; manipulative care provided by foreign-trained osteopaths) on chronic symptoms of multiple sclerosis (ms) is lacking. the conduct of evidence-based osteopathic research is imperative not only for scientific, economic, and professional reasons, but also to drive health care policy and clinical practice guidelines. osteopaths, like other health care providers, are under increasing pressure to deliver evidence-based health care and to improve patient outcomes. therefore, it is incumbent on the osteopathy community to gather evidence in order to practice scientifically informed effective methods. although there is little evidence-based literature regarding osteopathic manipulative treatment for ophthalmic conditions, the general principles and techniques of osteopathic manipulative medicine can be used to manage various ophthalmic pathologic conditions. the nature of primary reasons for osteopathic consultations, coupled with documented satisfaction of patients with this approach, suggest a future for multidisciplinary collaborative health care including osteopathy. osteopathy is a discipline emphasizing the conservative treatment of the disease in an olistic vision. this paper summarizes recent studies in response to the osteopathic research challenge, including clinical trials registered with clinicaltrials.gov and a systematic review and meta-analysis of osteopathic manipulative treatment (omt) for low back pain. the authors conclude that the osteopathic medical profession needs to conduct and publish research that is consistent with current practices in the conventional medical literature. |||",Yes

A study of 4560 women found a 65% relative reduction in the annual occurrence of invasive breast cancer compared with placebo. Additionally, a 53% reduction in invasive plus noninvasive breast cancer was observed. Exemestane has also been shown to have a relative reduction in risk of breast cancer recurrence or death of 24% compared with tamoxifen when given after 2 to 3 years of tamoxifen. Exemestane has been identified as a potential chemopreventive option with fewer serious side effects compared with selective estrogen receptor modulators in postmenopausal women. It is a safe and well-tolerated alternative for the treatment of postmenopausal patients with advanced breast cancer.","the benefits and risks of exemestane for the primary prevention of breast cancer are discussed and compared with other breast cancer chemoprevention therapies. a study of 4560 high-risk postmenopausal women taking exemestane 25 mg daily for a median of three years found a 65% relative reduction in the annual occurrence of invasive breast cancer compared with placebo (0.19% versus 0.55%; hazard ratio, 0.35; 95% confidence interval [ci], 0.18-0.70; p = 0.002) and a 53% reduction in invasive plus noninvasive breast cancer (0.35% versus 0.77%; hazard ratio, 0.47; 95% ci, 0.27-0.79; p = 0.04). as an alternative, exemestane, an aromatase inhibitor, has been evaluated for breast cancer prevention in postmenopausal women. a relative reduction in risk of breast cancer recurrence or death of 24% has been shown with exemestane compared with tamoxifen when given after 2 to 3 years of tamoxifen. exemestane 25 mg daily taken for at least three years is a new option for the prevention of breast cancer in high-risk postmenopausal women. exemestane is an orally active steroidal aromatase inhibitor that has demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of postmenopausal patients with advanced breast cancer. exemestane (exe) treats estrogen receptor positive (er+) breast cancer in postmenopausal women by inhibiting the estrogen-synthesizing cytochrome p450 cyp19a1. exemestane is a third-generation aromatase inhibitor, which has proven to be a useful drug in the treatment of early stage breast cancer. patients on exemestane as a group do not appear to have a significantly changed quality of life in comparison to tamoxifen, while having a statistically significant benefit in preventing breast cancer recurrence. exemestane is a safe and well-tolerated alternative for the treatment of postmenopausal patients with advanced breast cancer. exemestane is effective as a second- or third-line treatment of advanced, estrogen-receptor positive breast cancer in postmenopausal patients. exemestane, an aromatase inhibitor, has recently been identified as a potential chemopreventive option with fewer serious side effects compared with selective estrogen receptor modulators in postmenopausal women. the steroidal aromatase inactivator exemestane blocks estrogen biosynthesis and is thus employed for the prevention and treatment of breast cancer. exemestane, an orally active irreversible inhibitor of aromatase, was recently approved as second-line endocrine therapy of advanced hormone-sensitive postmenopausal breast cancer. the mechanism of action, pharmacology, and clinical efficacy and safety of exemestane in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer are reviewed. exemestane is a third-generation aromatase inhibitor used in the treatment of estrogen-receptor-positive breast cancer in postmenopausal women. exemestane, a non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor that shuts down estrogen synthesis, and paclitaxel, an antineoplastic drug, inhibiting microtubule formation and interfering with the cells potential to proliferate, are well established treatments for metastatic breast cancer. exemestane is a potent inhibitor of aromatization reducing estrogen synthesis in vivo by greater than 97%. the purpose of this study was to assess the uptake of exemestane in a breast cancer prevention clinic. the results provide practical implications suggesting that exemestane may have limited impact on breast cancer chemoprevention uptake. |||",Yes
Does a newly approved contraceptive pill with the active ingredient combination nomegestrol acetate and 17ß-estradiol have fewer undesirable side effects than other birth control pills?,No,"The provided context indicates that the combined oral contraceptive containing nomegestrol acetate and 17β-estradiol (e2) has been shown to be at least as effective as drospirenone/ethinylestradiol in terms of contraceptive efficacy and cycle control. However, the context does not provide a direct comparison of the undesirable side effects of this contraceptive pill with other birth control pills. The context does mention that the pill containing nomegestrol acetate and 17β-estradiol was generally well tolerated in healthy adult women, with an acceptable tolerability profile in line with that expected for a combined oral contraceptive. However, the context does not provide enough information to definitively state that this pill has fewer undesirable side effects than other birth control pills. Therefore, the answer is NEI (not enough information).","nomegestrol acetate and 17β-e2 were well tolerated and provided excellent contraceptive efficacy and acceptable cycle control. nomegestrol acetate/estradiol is a combined oral contraceptive with approval in many countries. in two large, 1-year, randomized, open-label, multicentre, phase iii trials in healthy adult women (aged 18-50 years), nomegestrol acetate/estradiol was at least as effective as drospirenone/ethinylestradiol as contraceptive therapy, as the pregnancy rates in women aged 18-35 years (primary efficacy population) in terms of the pearl index (primary endpoint) were numerically lower with nomegestrol acetate/estradiol, although the between-group difference was not statistically significant. to estimate the efficacy, cycle control, tolerability, and safety of a monophasic combined oral contraceptive containing nomegestrol acetate and 17β-estradiol (e2) in comparison with drospirenone and ethinyl e2. overall, compared with drospirenone/ethinylestradiol, nomegestrol acetate/estradiol appeared to be associated with less favourable acne-related outcomes, and shorter, lighter or absent periods. nomegestrol acetate/estradiol therapy for up to 1 year was generally well tolerated in healthy adult women, with an acceptable tolerability profile in line with that expected for a combined oral contraceptive. in a randomized, open-label, comparative multicenter trial, healthy women (n=2,281; age 18-50 years) at risk for pregnancy and in need of contraception were allocated in a 3:1 ratio to receive nomegestrol acetate (2.5 mg) and 17β-e2 (1.5 mg) in a 24-4-day regimen (investigational drug) or drospirenone (3.0 mg) and ethinyl e2 (30 micrograms) in a 21-7-day regimen (comparator) for 13 consecutive, 28-day cycles. to compare the effects of two monophasic combined oral contraceptives, containing either nomegestrol acetate/17β-oestradiol (nomac/e2) or levonorgestrel/ ethinylestradiol (lng/ee) on endocrine function, androgens, and sex hormone-binding globulin (shbg). two triphasic oral contraceptives containing either gestodene or norethindrone as the progestogenic compound combined with ethinyl estradiol were compared in a randomized clinical trial to assess their contraceptive reliability, clinical tolerance and cycle control. new hormonal contraceptive agents, norelgestromin-ethinyl estradiol patch, etonogestrel-ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring, and medroxyprogesterone-estradiol cypionate injection, were designed to increase compliance and decrease adverse effects while maintaining efficacy. this fixed-dose combination tablet contains nomegestrol acetate, a highly selective progestogen, and estradiol, a natural estrogen. 17β-estradiol is a naturally-occurring estrogen, and a contraceptive pill containing such an estrogen offers potential benefits with regard to metabolic side effects and adverse events. combined oral contraceptives (cocs) containing the progestins--gestodene, desogestrel or norgestimate--were developed to minimize androgenic side effects and are considered an effective, well-tolerated contraceptive option. the contraceptive pill containing estradiol valerate and dienogest meets women's requests for: a more natural contraceptive, that is reliable and easy to use, with positive cosmetic effects; less intense and shorter bleeding, reduced anaemia and increased vital energy; reduced dysmenorrhoea and all the specific cycle-related symptoms linked to a drop in oestrogen and the related systemic inflammation, the result of a hormone free interval (hfi) of just two days; with a good impact on sexuality and overall well-being, all associated with a high level of efficacy: (uncorrected pearl index: 0.79; corrected: 0.42). studies indicate that this formulation may be associated with decreased hepatic activation compared to contraceptive pills that contain ethinyl estradiol. the new pill containing estradiol valerate and dienogest may satisfy women's need for: a more natural hormonal contraceptive with a low hormone dosage, high reliability and good tolerability; a simple dosing schedule (one pill per day for 28 days); a positive cosmetic effect on the skin; lighter and shorter withdrawal bleeding, improved anaemia, less fatigue and higher vital energy; reduced dysmenorrhoea and a dramatic reduction in all symptoms thanks to a shorter hormone free interval (hfi) of just two days. to compare the effects of a monophasic combined oral contraceptive containing nomegestrol acetate/17β-estradiol (nomac/e2) on bone mineral density with a combined oral contraceptive containing levonorgestrel/ethinylestradiol (lng/ee). gestodene achieves contraceptive efficacy with the lowest dose of any progestin in a coc, and has an established and favorable short- and long-term tolerability profile. the pill containing estradiol valerate and dienogest is a contraceptive option that may satisfy women's demands for a more natural contraceptive while offering high reliability, good tolerability, a simple dosing schedule, lighter and shorter withdrawal bleeding, improved anaemia and a reduction in cycle-related symptoms thanks to a shorter hormone free interval, and improved sexuality and general well-being. compared with the nonalkylated estrogen/norethindrone and the triphasic ee2/levonorgestrel formulations, the low-dose ee2/norethindrone combination resulted in small but significant increases in plasma triglyceride and very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (p less than 0.01), which seemed unfavorable from a clinical point of view. |||",No
Does PrEP reduce the risk of HIV infection?,Yes,".

     Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) has been shown to be effective in reducing the risk of HIV infection. Multiple randomized controlled trials have demonstrated that daily oral PrEP significantly decreases the risk of HIV acquisition in high-risk individuals, including men who have sex with men and people who inject drugs. The efficacy of PrEP is closely dependent on adherence, and it is recommended for individuals with substantial risk for HIV infection. PrEP involves the use of antiretroviral therapy (ART) daily or before and after sex to decrease the risk of acquiring HIV infection. The use of PrEP as a single daily coformulated pill containing tenofovir-emtricitabine is a promising intervention to reduce the likelihood of HIV acquisition in at-risk individuals. However, it is important to note that the efficacy of PrEP may be reduced in case of viruses harboring resistances to tenofovir-emtricitabine, and alternative antiretroviral drugs may be proposed in selected cases.","available evidence supports the efficacy of pre-exposure prophylaxis (prep) in decreasing the incidence of human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) infection among high-risk individuals, especially when used in combination with other behavioural preventive methods. prep was associated with decreased risk of hiv infection vs placebo or no prep after 4 months to 4 years (11 trials; relative risk [rr], 0.46 [95% ci, 0.33-0.66]; i2 = 67%; absolute risk reduction [ard], -2.0% [95% ci, -2.8% to -1.2%]). hiv preexposure prophylaxis (prep) decreases risk of hiv acquisition; however, its efficacy is closely dependent on adherence. randomized controlled trials have demonstrated that daily oral prep dramatically reduces the risk of hiv infection when it is taken as directed. hiv pre-exposure prophylaxis (prep) has been found to be efficacious in preventing hiv acquisition among seronegative individuals in a variety of risk groups, including men who have sex with men and people who inject drugs. prep as an intervention to reduce hiv transmission appears to have a safe benefit-risk profile in clinical trials. pre-exposure prophylaxis (prep) is highly effective in reducing the risk for hiv infection among men who have sex with men (msm) and may have an important impact in slowing down the hiv epidemic. although preliminary studies showed that preexposure prophylaxis (prep) lowers the hiv transmission in individuals with hiv, confirmative trials are ongoing and prep is not routinely recommended. pre-exposure prophylaxis (prep) is an effective and evidence-based hiv-prevention option and is recommended for individuals with substantial risk for hiv infection [1]. antiretroviral therapy (art) used as preexposure prophylaxis (prep) by human immunodeficiency virus (hiv)-seronegative individuals reduces the risk of acquiring hiv. pre-exposure prophylaxis (prep) is a highly effective, pharmacologic method of hiv prevention. antiretroviral (arv)-based pre-exposure prophylaxis (prep) is a promising new hiv prevention strategy. hiv preexposure prophylaxis (prep) is an effective tool in preventing hiv infection among high-risk men who have sex with men (msm). our results show that prep had minimal influence in reducing the risk of hiv transmission during natural conception in hiv-1-serodiscordant couples with a stably suppressed viral load. pre-exposure prophylaxis (prep), in which hiv uninfected persons with ongoing hiv risk use antiretroviral medications as chemoprophylaxis against sexual hiv acquisition, is a promising new hiv prevention strategy. proof-of-concept that prep, as oral or vaginal topical tenofovir-based products, protects against sexual hiv acquisition has been demonstrated in clinical trials conducted among men who have sex with men and heterosexual men and women. preexposure prophylaxis (prep) involves use of antiretroviral therapy (art) daily or before and after sex to decrease risk of acquiring hiv infection. many individuals who stop prep remain at risk of hiv, and participants reported that proactive outreach could potentially have prevented hiv infections. pre-exposure prophylaxis (prep), taken as a single daily coformulated pill containing tenofovir -emtricitabine, is a promising intervention to reduce the likelihood of hiv acquisition in at-risk individuals, including men who have sex with men. pre-exposure prophylaxis (prep) with tdf/ftc significantly reduces the risk for hiv-1 transmission, but, to date, nobody knows if prep can still be useful in case of viruses harboring resistances to tdf/ftc or if alternative antiretroviral drugs might be rather proposed in selected cases. |||",Yes
"Does exercise, a restricted diet, or both together help prevent excessive weight gain during pregnancy?",Yes,"The evidence from the review suggests that both diet and exercise, as well as diet alone, are effective in minimizing gestational weight gain. Preliminary evidence indicates that a combination of dieting and exercise may be more effective than diet alone in helping women lose weight after childbirth, as it improves maternal cardiorespiratory fitness and preserves fat-free mass. Healthy eating and physical activity strategies have been shown to be effective in controlling gestational weight gain, with healthy eating with calorie and macronutrient goals being particularly effective in limiting excessive gestational weight gain among pregnant overweight and obese women. Behavioral modification through physical activity and dietary counseling has also been shown to have beneficial effects on pregnant women with overweight/obesity. In summary, the evidence suggests that exercise, a restricted diet, or both together can help prevent excessive weight gain during pregnancy.","interventions based on diet and physical activity minimise gestational weight gain with varied effect on a number of clinical outcomes. evidence from this review suggests that both diet and exercise together and diet alone help women to lose weight after childbirth. preliminary evidence from this review suggests that dieting and exercise together appear to be more effective than diet alone at helping women to lose weight after childbirth, because the former improves maternal cardiorespiratory fitness level and preserves fat-free mass, while diet alone reduces fat-free mass. this review synthesized healthy eating and physical activity strategies and their effects on excessive gestational weight gain prevention. healthy eating and/or physical activity are effective in gestational weight gain control. healthy eating with calorie and macronutrient goals are especially effective in limiting excessive gestational weight gain among pregnant overweight and obese women. twenty-three randomized controlled trials that included healthy eating and/or physical activity as an intervention in healthy pregnant overweight or obese adult women and gestational weight gain as a primary or secondary outcome were reviewed. nevertheless, it may be preferable to lose weight through a combination of diet and exercise as this improves maternal cardiorespiratory fitness and preserves fat-free mass, while diet alone reduces fat-free mass. weight retention after pregnancy may contribute to obesity. weight retention after pregnancy may contribute to obesity. behavioural modification through physical activity and dietary counselling has been shown to have beneficial effects on pregnant women with overweight/obesity. diet and physical activity are factors that can influence the loss of retained pregnancy weight after birth. regular exercise during pregnancy promotes overall wellness and helps maintain appropriate gestational weight gain and appropriate fetal weight gain. this meta-analysis might suggest beneficial effects of supervised exercise on pregnant women with overweight/obesity to prevent excessive gwg, attenuates insulin resistance, and the post-prandial blood glucose level. the objectives of this review were to evaluate the effect of diet, exercise or both for weight reduction in women after childbirth, and to assess the impact of these interventions on maternal body composition, cardiorespiratory fitness, breastfeeding performance and other child and maternal outcomes. the objectives of this review were to evaluate the effect of diet, exercise or both for weight reduction in women after childbirth, and to assess the impact of these interventions on maternal body composition, cardiorespiratory fitness, breastfeeding performance and other child and maternal outcomes. heathy eating and/or physical activity (21 studies, n = 6,920 subjects) demonstrated 1.81 kg (95% ci: -3.47, -0.16) of gestational weight gain reduction favouring intervention. healthy eating (-5.77 kg, 95% ci: -9.34, -2.21, p = 0.02) had a larger effect size than combined healthy eating/physical activity (-0.82 kg, 95% ci: -1.28, -0.36, p = 0.0005) in limiting gestational weight gain. in summary, women with pre-pregnancy obesity might require from additional interventions beyond light-to-moderate intensity gestational exercise (e.g., diet and/or higher exercise loads) to ensure cardiometabolic benefits. our primary aim was to assess whether regular supervised exercise training in pregnancy could reduce gwg in women with prepregnancy overweight/obesity. |||",Yes
Does taking antibiotics for acute sinusitis speed up the healing of the infection?,Yes,"The use of antibiotics for acute sinusitis has been shown to provide a small benefit for clinical outcomes in immunocompetent primary care patients. Antibiotics have a small treatment effect in patients with uncomplicated acute sinusitis in a primary care setting with symptoms for more than seven days. Antimicrobial therapy for sinusitis has been shown to reduce or eliminate pathologic bacteria associated with rhinosinusitis and improve the symptoms associated with the disease. The preferred antibiotic for treatment is amoxicillin or TMP-SMZ, as most acute sinus infections are caused by H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae. Radiographic outcomes were improved by antibiotic treatment. However, it is not clear whether antibiotics improve the outcome for patients with clinically diagnosed acute rhinosinusitis. Most acute sinusitis cases not prescribed antibiotics resolve spontaneously.","there is moderate evidence that antibiotics provide a small benefit for clinical outcomes in immunocompetent primary care patients with uncomplicated acute sinusitis. antibiotics have a small treatment effect in patients with uncomplicated acute sinusitis in a primary care setting with symptoms for more than seven days. we examined whether antibiotics are effective in treating acute sinusitis, and if so, which antibiotic classes are the most effective. to assess the effectiveness of antibiotics in acute bacterial sinusitis. however, it is not clear whether antibiotics improve the outcome for patients with clinically diagnosed acute rhinosinusitis. antibiotics and decongestants are the cornerstones of therapy for acute sinusitis. we examined whether antibiotics are indicated for acute sinusitis, and if so, which antibiotic classes are most effective. antimicrobial therapy for sinusitis has been shown to reduce or eliminate pathologic bacteria associated with rhinosinusitis and improve the symptoms associated with the disease. acute sinusitis is a common clinical problem that usually results in a prescription for antibiotics but the role of antibiotics is debated. it is still under discussion whether antibiotics are effective in the treatment of acute sinusitis. acute sinusitis-like complaints are very common and are usually treated with antibiotics in spite of the lack of evidence for the effectiveness of antibiotic therapy and the increasing number of resistant strains. the treatment of acute bacterial sinusitis is medical, the regimen including oral and nasal decongestants and antibiotics. antibiotics have demonstrated efficacy for the treatment of acute bacterial sinusitis in clinical trials yet little is known of their effectiveness in real-life treatment settings. because most acute sinus infections are caused by h influenzae and s pneumoniae, the preferred antibiotic for treatment is amoxicillin or tmp-smz. to assess whether the addition of an intranasal corticosteroid to antibiotic therapy affects the speed and rate of recovery of such patients with acute rhinosinusitis. for acute maxillary sinusitis confirmed radiographically or by aspiration, current evidence is limited but supports the use of penicillin or amoxicillin for 7 to 14 days. a review of recent literature shows a high incidence of positive cultures for staphylococcus aureus from the sinuses of patients with chronic rhinosinusitis, both before and after surgery, but has not produced convincing evidence that staphylococcus aureus has a significant role in the pathogenesis or clinical course of the disease. the objective of this study was to investigate the therapeutic role of vitamin a on healing of acute sinusitis. radiographic outcomes were improved by antibiotic treatment. most acute sinusitis cases not prescribed antibiotics resolve spontaneously. |||",Yes
Does colonoscopy reduce mortality from colorectal cancer?,Yes,"Observational studies have demonstrated that colonoscopy significantly reduces the incidence and mortality of colorectal cancer (CRC) in the general population. Compared to no endoscopic screening, receipt of a screening colonoscopy has been associated with a 67% reduction in the risk of death from any colorectal cancer. Pooled analysis has shown that colonoscopy is associated with a 61% reduction in CRC incidence and a 61% reduction in CRC mortality in patients with non-malignant findings. Furthermore, colonoscopy has been found to have a substantial impact on CRC incidence and mortality through the detection and removal of precancerous lesions and early cancers. These findings support the use of colonoscopy as an efficient and preferred screening method to reduce the incidence and associated mortality from CRC.","observational studies have shown that colonoscopy reduces colorectal cancer (crc) incidence and mortality in the general population. use of colonoscopy is thought to reduce colorectal cancer (crc) mortality, but its impact at the population level is unclear. colonoscopy is thought to be a powerful and cost-effective tool to reduce colorectal cancer (crc) incidence and mortality. colonoscopy with detection and removal of neoplasms strongly reduces risk of colorectal cancer (crc). indeed, colonoscopy has contributed to a decline in the number of colorectal cancer related deaths. colonoscopy with polypectomy significantly reduces crc incidence and cancer-related mortality in the general population. through its impact on the adenoma-carcinoma sequence, colonoscopy has a central role in the detection and prevention of colorectal cancer (crc). compared with no endoscopic screening, receipt of a screening colonoscopy was associated with a 67% reduction in the risk of death from any colorectal cancer (adjusted or (aor)=0.33, 95% ci 0.21 to 0.52). colonoscopy with a possible polypectomy is an efficient and preferred screening method to reduce the incidence of colorectal cancer (crc). screening colonoscopy was associated with a substantial and comparably decreased mortality risk for both right-sided and left-sided cancers within a large community-based population. colonoscopic screening with removal of adenomatous polyps in individuals at average risk is known to decrease the incidence and associated mortality from colon cancer. lower gi endoscopy, such as colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy, is thought to have a substantial impact on colorectal cancer incidence and mortality through detection and removal of precancerous lesions and early cancers. our study indicated that colonoscopy could significantly reduce the incidence and mortality of crc. pooled analysis showed that colonoscopy was associated with a 61% rr reduction in crc incidence (rr: 0.39; 95% ci: 0.26-0.60; i(2)=93.6%) and a 61% reduction in crc mortality (rr: 0.39; 95% ci: 0.35-0.43; i(2)=12.0%) in patients with non-malignant findings, although there was high heterogeneity for the outcome of crc incidence. our results showed that colonoscopy was associated with a 52% rr reduction in incidence of crc (rr: 0.48, 95% ci: 0.46-0.49) and 62% rr reduction in mortality of crc (rr: 0.38, 95% ci: 0.36-0.40). by cancer location, screening colonoscopy was associated with a 65% reduction in risk of death for right-colon cancers (aor=0.35, ci 0.18 to 0.65) and a 75% reduction for left-colon/rectal cancers (aor=0.25, ci 0.12 to 0.53). observational data support a protective effect of colonoscopy and polypectomy on crc incidence and mortality. screening colonoscopy's effectiveness in reducing colorectal cancer mortality risk in community populations is unclear, particularly for right-colon cancers, leading to recommendations against its use for screening in some countries. this study aimed to determine whether, among average-risk people, receipt of screening colonoscopy reduces the risk of dying from both right-colon and left-colon/rectal cancers. to estimate the effect of current colonoscopy use on crc mortality and its further potential in reducing crc mortality. |||",Yes
Do nicotine replacement products like nicotine gum or nicotine patches help with long-term smoking cessation?,Yes,"Nicotine replacement therapies (NRTs) have been shown to be effective in facilitating smoking cessation. These therapies include nicotine gum, transdermal patches, intranasal spray, and inhaled preparations. The effectiveness of NRTs is influenced by factors such as the clinical setting, the level of nicotine dependency, the dosage and form of NRT used, and the intensity of additional advice and support offered to the smoker. While only one-quarter to one-third of smokers who utilize NRTs to quit smoking are able to maintain long-term abstinence from tobacco use, NRTs have been shown to improve success rates in smoking cessation treatment. Treatment with the nicotine inhaler plus nicotine patch has resulted in significantly higher cessation rates than inhaler plus placebo patch. The nicotine lozenge is also a safe and effective treatment for smoking cessation in low- and high-dependence smokers. Higher doses of nicotine patch may produce small increases in quit rates. Therefore, it can be concluded that nicotine replacement products like nicotine gum or nicotine patches do help with long-term smoking cessation.","nicotine replacement therapies have proved to be of value in smoking cessation. studies with nicotine chewing gum and nicotine skin patches indicate that nicotine replacement can help people to give up smoking. nicotine replacement therapy has been shown to improve success rates in smoking cessation treatment. nicotine replacement therapy is often used to maintain smoking cessation. nicotine replacement therapies (nrts), including transdermal patch, gum, lozenge, nasal spray and inhaler, are widely used for the treatment of tobacco dependence; however, only one-quarter to one-third of smokers who utilise nrts to quit smoking are able to maintain long-term abstinence from tobacco use. since nicotine gum was introduced in the 1980s, nicotine replacement therapy has become the most widely used pharmacological smoking cessation treatment. for several years, nicotine replacement therapy (nicotine gum, patches, and nasal spray) has been the mainstay for the treatment of nicotine dependence. to determine the effectiveness of nicotine replacement therapies (nrts) (including gum, transdermal patch, intranasal spray, and inhaled preparations) in facilitating smoking cessation, and to determine whether the effect was influenced by the clinical setting in which the smoker was recruited and treated, the level of nicotine dependency, the dosage of nrt used, or the intensity of additional advice and support offered to the smoker. nicotine replacement therapy (nrt) is an effective treatment for smoking cessation, but as with all such pharmacotherapies, the majority of smokers who use nrt products do not stop smoking or remain abstinent long term. currently approved medications for smoking cessation are nicotine replacement medications (nrt), including nicotine patch, gum, lozenge, sublingual tablet, inhaler and nasal spray, the antidepressant bupropion, and the nicotinic partial agonist varenicline. nicotine replacement therapy is an effective treatment for nicotine-dependent smokers. the aims of this review were to determine the effectiveness of the different forms of nicotine replacement therapy (chewing gum, transdermal patches, nasal spray, inhalers and tablets) in achieving abstinence from cigarettes, or a sustained reduction in amount smoked; to determine whether the effect is influenced by the clinical setting in which the smoker is recruited and treated, the dosage and form of the nrt used, or the intensity of additional advice and support offered to the smoker; to determine whether combinations of nrt are more effective than one type alone; and to determine its effectiveness compared to other pharmacotherapies. the aims of this review were to determine the effectiveness of the different forms of nicotine replacement therapy (chewing gum, transdermal patches, nasal spray, inhalers and tablets) in achieving abstinence from cigarettes, or a sustained reduction in amount smoked; to determine whether the effect is influenced by the clinical setting in which the smoker is recruited and treated, the dosage and form of the nrt used, or the intensity of additional advice and support offered to the smoker; to determine whether combinations of nrt are more effective than one type alone; and to determine its effectiveness compared to other pharmacotherapies. nicotine replacement therapy has become a popular therapy for smokers attempting to stop smoking. treatment with the nicotine inhaler plus nicotine patch resulted in significantly higher cessation rates than inhaler plus placebo patch. the nicotine lozenge is a safe and effective new treatment for smoking cessation in low- and high-dependence smokers. higher doses of nicotine patch may produce small increases in quit rates. higher doses of nicotine patch may produce small increases in quit rates. hence, nicotine replacement therapy by way of gum, patch, or spray has been advocated. we compared the efficacy of the nicotine inhaler plus nicotine patch vs nicotine inhaler plus placebo patch for smoking cessation. |||",Yes
"Is short, high-intensity training equally effective as longer, moderate-intensity training?",Yes,"The literature suggests that high-intensity interval training (HIIT) is more effective than moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT) in improving functional ability and increasing peak oxygen consumption (VO2max). However, it has not been studied when HIIT is applied in a circuit (HIICT) and direct comparisons with higher-volume MICT under unsupervised settings are limited. Furthermore, although HIIT protocols are time efficient, they are not superior to conventional exercise training in sedentary young adults. Therefore, it cannot be concluded that short, high-intensity training is equally effective as longer, moderate-intensity training.","the present study compared the impact of a low-volume high-intensity interval training to a ""all-out"" sprint interval training. key pointsgiven the markedly lower training volume in the training groups, our results suggest that intense interval training is indeed a time-efficient strategy to induce rapid metabolic and performance adaptations.the results demonstrate that a practical low-volume hit program is effective for improving metabolic and performance adaptations that resemble many of the same performance gains occurred in all-out sit protocol. of substantial interest is that the low volume high intensity training provides similar results but involves only half the intensity with double the repetitions. within a controlled laboratory environment, high-intensity interval training (hit) elicits similar cardiovascular and metabolic benefits as traditional moderate-intensity continuous training (mict). the literature suggests that high-intensity interval training (hiit) is more effective than moderate-intensity continuous training (mict) to improve functional ability. to date, a majority of uphill training research has focused on shorter, faster training bouts; however, longer, slower bouts based on an individual's velocity at maximum oxygen consumption (vmax) may prove more effective. key pointssteady state training equivalent to hiit in untrained studentsmild interval training presents very similar physiologic challenge compared to steady state traininghiit (particularly very high intensity variants were less enjoyable than steady state or mild interval trainingenjoyment of training decreases across the course of an 8 week experimental training program. this study compared the effects of two hiit protocols vs steady-state training on aerobic and anaerobic capacity following 8-weeks of training. high-intensity interval training (hiit) has similar or better effects than moderate-intensity continuous training (mict) in increasing peak oxygen consumption (vo2max), however, it has not been studied when hiit is applied in a circuit (hiict). high-intensity interval training (hiit) has been proposed as a time-efficient exercise protocol to improve metabolic health, but direct comparisons with higher-volume moderate-intensity continuous training (mict) under unsupervised settings are limited. low-volume high-intensity interval training (hiit) may be a time-efficient strategy that leads to similar or superior improvements in cardiorespiratory fitness (crf) and cardiovascular disease (cvd) risk factors when compared with moderate-intensity continuous training (mict). the results suggest that although hiit protocols are time efficient, they are not superior to conventional exercise training in sedentary young adults. moderate-intensity exercise sessions are incorporated into heat-acclimation and hypoxic-training protocols to improve performance in hot and hypoxic environments, respectively. this study compared explosive and traditional training over a 6-week intervention in 30 healthy young adult male recreational soccer players. interval training consisting of brief high intensity repetitive runs (30 s) alternating with periods of complete rest (30 s) has been reported to be efficient in improving maximal oxygen uptake (vo2max) and to be tolerated well even by untrained persons. in untrained and recreationally active individuals, short-term hiit is a potent stimulus to induce physiological remodeling similar to traditional endurance training despite a markedly lower total exercise volume and training time commitment. in a randomized controlled pilot design, we evaluated the effects of two types of interval training protocols, varying in intensity and interval duration, on clinical outcomes in overweight/obese men. the results of the meta-analysis indicate that long-hiit may be the optimal form of interval training to augment tt performance. short-distance triathletes, however, perform most of their competition-specific training around moderate-intensity intervals. twenty-four participants (age: 48.1±5.2yr; bmi: 25.8±2.3kg·m-2) were randomly assigned to undertake either hiit (10 x 1-min bouts of running at 80-90% hrmax separated by 1-min active recovery) or mict (50-min continuous jogging/brisk walking at 65-70% hrmax) for 3 sessions/week for 8 weeks (2-week supervised + 6-week unsupervised training). |||",Yes
Do behavioral therapy methods help with specific fears (phobias) such as fear of spiders?,Yes,"Justification: The findings indicate that exposure therapy, a behavioral treatment method, is effective in reducing avoidance behaviors and negative beliefs associated with spider phobia. In-vivo exposure therapy, which involves real-life exposure to feared stimuli, has been found to be particularly beneficial. Additionally, the use of realistically animated spider stimuli in computer-based interventions and virtual reality exposure therapy has also shown promise. The study also highlights the role of disgust in spider phobia and suggests that exposure therapy can be effective in reducing fear and perceived danger, especially at high levels of pretreatment disgust propensity. However, more research is needed to fully understand the role of disgust in the treatment of spider phobia.","an important component in psychological treatment of spider phobia is exposure to phobic situations that reduces avoidance behaviors. compared with untreated spider phobic controls, the treated phobics changed significantly in their negative beliefs about spiders after treatment. our findings reveal the importance of targeting movement-related fears in in-vivo exposure therapy for spider phobia and using realistically animated spider stimuli in computer-based experimental paradigms and clinical interventions such as virtual reality exposure therapy. disgust is thought to play a prominent role in multiple anxiety disorders and fears, including spider phobia, though little attention has been given to specific treatment strategies that may be effective for multiple disgust-based fears. spider phobics show an exaggerated fear response when encountering spiders. spider phobics reported significantly more fear and disgust than nonphobics towards threat and disgust-relevant stimuli. similar effects of exposure on spider fear were found at high levels of pretreatment spider-related disgust. the implications of these findings for the role of disgust in the treatment of spider phobia are discussed. spider phobia is characterized by exaggerated fear of situations where spiders could be present, resulting in avoidance of such situations and compromised quality of life. women with significant spider fear were randomized to three 30-minute sessions of exposure therapy involving repeated contact with a dirt mixture (n=17) or a waitlist control condition (n=17). the conducted study provides first evidence that fmri neurofeedback has a facilitating effect on anxiety regulation in spider phobia. a test of the hypothesis was undertaken using spider phobics' performance in a recognition memory task involving dead spiders as an index of processing. the first experiment confirmed the hypothesis of poorer processing of spider stimuli in phobics, but only for big spiders on a post hoc division of spider stimuli. the present study also examined differences in fear and disgust responding to threat-relevant and disgust-relevant stimuli between spider phobics and nonphobics. phobics displayed stronger negative modulation of activity in the lateral prefrontal cortex, precuneus, and visual cortex by encounter expectancies for spiders, relative to snakes or birds (within-participants analysis); these effects were not seen in controls. in the present study, we evaluated contamination-focused exposure as a potential transdiagnostic treatment strategy for disgust-based fears in a spider fearful sample. at high (but not low) levels of pretreatment disgust propensity, exposure led to lower in vivo spider fear and perceived danger than waitlist, though exposure had no effects on spider-related disgust. although disgust plays a significant role in the etiology of spider phobia, there remains a paucity of research examining the role of disgust in the treatment of spider phobia. assessments of spider fear and disgust were administered at baseline and at one-week posttreatment. controls and treated phobics showed the same change in their reaction time latencies to spider stimuli in the stroop test. |||",Yes
"Can honey accelerate the healing of second degree burns with pain, redness and blisters?",Yes,"The context suggests that honey may improve healing times in mild to moderate superficial and partial thickness burns, which includes second degree burns, compared with some conventional dressings. The topical application of honey has been observed to have favorable influences on the various phases of burn and wound healing, thus accelerating the healing process. In acute wounds, specifically partial-thickness burns, honey might reduce time to healing compared with some conventional dressings. Evidence from animal studies and trials suggests that honey may accelerate wound healing. Honey applied topically on cutaneous wounds has been found to accelerate the healing processes and has beneficial effects on the skin as an antiseptic for wounds, burns, and ulcers, and as a healing promoter. Topical honey treatment has been shown to possess antimicrobial properties, promote autolytic debridement, stimulate growth of wound tissues to hasten healing, and to start the healing process in dormant wounds, stimulating anti-inflammatory activity that rapidly reduces pain, edema, and exudate production.","honey may improve healing times in mild to moderate superficial and partial thickness burns compared with some conventional dressings. macroscopic and microscopic observations under in vivo assessment suggested that the topical application of honey might have favourable influences on the various phases of burn and wound healing hence accelerating the healing process. the objective was to determine whether honey increases the rate of healing in acute wounds (burns, lacerations and other traumatic wounds) and chronic wounds (venous ulcers, arterial ulcers, diabetic ulcers, pressure ulcers, infected surgical wounds). honey has successfully been used in the treatment of a broad spectrum of injuries including burns and non-healing wounds. although it has been known for many centuries that honey can accelerate wound healing, there have only been isolated reports of its use in the healing of burns, ulcers, infected wounds and open wounds. honey is recognized as an efficacious topical antimicrobial agent in the treatment of burns and wounds. in acute wounds, specifically partial-thickness burns, honey might reduce time to healing compared with some conventional dressings (wmd -4.68 days, 95%ci -4.28 to -5.09 days), but, when compared with early excision and grafting, honey delays healing in partial- and full-thickness burns (wmd 13.6 days, 95% ci 10.02 to 17.18 days). in acute wounds, honey may reduce time to healing compared with some conventional dressings in partial thickness burns (wmd -4.68 days, 95%ci -4.28 to -5.09 days). the objective of this review was to assess the effects of honey compared with silver dressings on the healing of burn wounds. in acute wounds, three trials evaluated the effect of honey in acute lacerations, abrasions or minor surgical wounds and 12 trials evaluated the effect of honey in burns. the available evidence suggests that honey dressings promote better wound healing than silver sulfadiazine for burns. in acute wounds, three trials evaluated the effect of honey in acute lacerations, abrasions or minor surgical wounds and nine trials evaluated the effect the honey in burns. it has been reported that honey hastens wound healing by accelerating wound contractions. evidence from animal studies and trials suggests that honey may accelerate wound healing. these findings suggest that honey applied topically on cutaneous wounds accelerates the healing processes and appears to have an important property that makes it ideal as a dressing for cutaneous wounds. honey may delay healing in partial- and full-thickness burns in comparison to early excision and grafting, and in cutaneous leishmaniasis when used as an adjuvant with meglumine antimoniate. evidence from animal studies and some trials has suggested honey may accelerate wound healing. evidence from animal studies and some trials has suggested that honey may accelerate wound healing. old and recent reports show that honey has beneficial effects on the skin as antiseptic for wounds, burns and ulcers and as a healing promoter. topical honey treatment has been shown to possess antimicrobial properties, promote autolytic debridement, stimulate growth of wound tissues to hasten healing, and to start the healing process in dormant wounds, stimulating anti-inflammatory activity that rapidly reduces pain, oedema and exudate production. |||",Yes
"Does honey work better than other wound treatments for chronic wounds (open leg, diabetic foot)?",No,"The context suggests that honey has potential as an effective treatment for chronic wounds, including diabetic foot ulcers. Honey has unique natural features as a wound healer, such as antibacterial activity, immune modulatory properties, and biocompatibility. Clinical observations and a small number of clinical case studies have shown that honey can accelerate wound healing and improve tissue healing in severely infected cutaneous wounds. However, the context also indicates that there is insufficient good quality data to realistically conclude on the efficacy of honey on diabetic foot ulcers. Therefore, it is not possible to definitively state that honey works better than other wound treatments for chronic wounds based on the information provided.","because honey has some unique natural features as a wound healer, it works even more effectively on diabetic wounds than on normal wounds. clinical observations suggest that honey holds significant promise as an effective treatment for a number of medical conditions and particularly in the management of non-healing wounds. honey dressing has been used to promote wound healing for years but scanty scientific studies did not provide enough evidences to justify it benefits in the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers. additionally, ways in which honey can be used as a safer, faster, and effective healing agent for diabetic wounds in comparison with other synthetic medications in terms of microbial resistance and treatment costs are also described to support its traditional claims. in this review, the potential role of honey's antibacterial activity on diabetic wound-related microorganisms and honey's clinical effectiveness in treating diabetic wounds based on the most recent studies is described. although honey has been used as an alternative medicine for wound healing since ancient times, the application of honey to diabetic wounds has only recently been revived. many studies have shown that honey might improve wound healing. in addition, honey is known as an ""all in one"" remedy for diabetic wound healing because it can combat many microorganisms that are involved in the wound process and because it possesses antioxidant activity and controls inflammation. this review showed that honey dressing is safer for treatment of diabetic foot ulcer but there is insufficient good quality data to realistically conclude on the efficacy of honey on diabetic foot ulcers. among several different alternative therapies, honey is an effective choice because it provides comparatively rapid wound healing. these findings suggest that honey applied topically on cutaneous wounds accelerates the healing processes and appears to have an important property that makes it ideal as a dressing for cutaneous wounds. although it has been known for many centuries that honey can accelerate wound healing, there have only been isolated reports of its use in the healing of burns, ulcers, infected wounds and open wounds. out of five clinical trials three concluded that honey dressing is better than conventional dressing, all the clinical trials proved safety of honey for the treatment of diabetic foot ulcer. many studies have demonstrated that honey has antibacterial activity in vitro, and a small number of clinical case studies have shown that application of honey to severely infected cutaneous wounds is capable of clearing infection from the wound and improving tissue healing. honey dressing has been applied in the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers (dfus). the suitability of honey as a wound healing agent is largely due to its antibacterial activity, immune modulatory properties, and biocompatibility. despite the usefulness of honey in wound healing, chronic wound infections continue to be a global problem requiring new and improved therapeutic interventions. this review outlines what is known about the medical properties of honey and indicates the potential for honey to be incorporated into the management of a large number of wound types. this article explores the healing properties of honey and illustrates the effectiveness of using honey in the management of chronic leg ulcers. honey has been shown to have antibacterial properties in vitro and animal studies have demonstrated accelerated wound healing with the use of honey. |||",No

Do gastrointestinal surgeries (bariatric surgeries) improve symptoms of type 2 diabetes?,Yes,"Gastrointestinal surgeries, also known as bariatric surgeries, have been shown to improve symptoms of type 2 diabetes. These procedures have been found to induce remission of type 2 diabetes in obese diabetic patients, and they also concomitantly improve other metabolic diseases such as nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, cardiovascular diseases, and hyperlipidemia. The weight-loss independent improvement of glycemic control observed after these procedures has led to the discussion of introducing bariatric surgery as a treatment for type 2 diabetes in patients with a body mass index < 35 kg/m(2). The use of gastric bypass as the preferred bariatric procedure for patients with obesity and type 2 diabetes has been found to improve diabetes care and reduce related societal costs. The underlying mechanism for this improvement is unclear, but nutrient interaction with the mid-gut may play a role in improving type 2 diabetes mellitus after bariatric surgery. Open-label studies have shown that bariatric surgery causes remission of diabetes in some patients with BMI <35 kg/m(2). Gastric bypass was found to be superior to sleeve gastrectomy for remission of type 2 diabetes at 1 year after surgery, and the two procedures had a similar beneficial effect on β-cell function.","bariatric surgery rapidly induces improvements in type 2 diabetes (t2d) in concert with reduction in systemic markers of inflammation. to review the role of bariatric surgery in the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes. in obese diabetic patients, bariatric surgery has been shown to induce remission of type 2 diabetes. bariatric surgery also concomitantly improves type 2 diabetes and other metabolic diseases such as nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, cardiovascular diseases, and hyperlipidemia. bariatric surgery is a highly effective treatment of type 2 diabetes in patients with morbid obesity. several conventional methods of bariatric surgery can induce long-term remission of type 2 diabetes mellitus (t2dm); novel gastrointestinal surgical procedures are reported to have similar effects. bariatric surgery has recently been endorsed as an effective treatment of type 2 diabetes (t2d) in severely obese patients. the weight-loss independent improvement of glycemic control observed after these procedures has led to the discussion whether bariatric surgery can be introduced as treatment for type 2 diabetes in patients with a body mass index < 35 kg/m(2). is bariatric surgery as primary therapy for type 2 diabetes mellitus (t2dm) with body mass index (bmi) <35 kg/m(2) justified? bariatric surgery is an effective treatment option for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (t2dm) and obesity. certain types of bariatric surgical procedures have proved not only to be effective with regard to treating obesity, but they also seem to be associated with endocrine changes which independently of weight loss give rise to remission of type 2 diabetes. should clinicians, therefore, implement bariatric procedures to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus in patients who do not meet current obesity-based criteria for surgery? the provocative idea that type 2 diabetes (t2d) may be a surgically treated disorder is based on accumulating evidence suggesting impressive remission rates of obesity and diabetes following bariatric surgery interventions. the use of gastric bypass as the preferred bariatric procedure for patients with obesity and type 2 diabetes could improve diabetes care and reduce related societal costs. gastrointestinal surgery may ameliorate glycemic control in type 2 diabetes mellitus within days to weeks--an effect that cannot be explained solely by the changes in food intake and body weight following gastric bypass. type 2 diabetes can be treated by gastrointestinal surgery, but the underlying mechanism is unclear. nutrient interaction with the mid-gut may play a role in improving type 2 diabetes mellitus (t2d) after bariatric surgery. open-label studies have shown that bariatric surgery causes remission of diabetes in some patients with bmi <35 kg/m(2). gastric bypass was found to be superior to sleeve gastrectomy for remission of type 2 diabetes at 1 year after surgery, and the two procedures had a similar beneficial effect on β-cell function. we hypothesize that sleeve gastrectomy (sg) and gastric bypass (rygb) surgeries resolve obesity-induced intestinal inflammation, thereby promoting t2d resolution. |||",Yes
Is there a connection between ADHD and neurodermatitis?,Yes,"Justification: Epidemiologic evidence indicates a relevant association between atopic dermatitis (AD) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Atopic dermatitis, also known as neurodermatitis, is associated with increased odds of ADHD in both adults and children. The co-occurrence of ADHD with AD has been well described in recent association studies. AD is a chronic inflammatory skin disease with characteristics such as pruritus, psychological stress, and sleep disturbance, all of which might increase the risk of ADHD. The link between ADHD and other neurodevelopmental disorders is substantially driven by unique genetic influences. In multivariate models, AD was associated with ADHD in both children and adults.","epidemiologic evidence indicates a relevant association between atopic dermatitis (ad) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (adhd). atopic dermatitis is associated with increased odds of add/adhd in adults and children. the co-occurrence of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (adhd) with atopic dermatitis (ad) has been well described in some recent association studies; however, we did not have any perspective on this relationship in our country. atopic dermatitis (ad) is a chronic inflammatory skin disease with the hallmark characteristics of pruritus, psychological stress, and sleep disturbance, all possibly associated with an increased risk of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (adhd). ad unaccompanied by other allergic disease was also associated with increased risk of add/adhd in children. atopic dermatitis (ad) is associated with chronic itch, allergic disease and sleep disturbance, all of which might increase the risk of attention deficit (hyperactivity) disorder (add/adhd). some research and clinical observations have linked neurofibromatosis type 1 (nf-1) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (adhd). in recent studies, it is emphasized that inflammation may have a role in adhd. therefore, we hypothesize that clinical features of adhd may be a risk factor for the development of als. findings suggest that adhd comorbidity is largely explained by genetically influenced general psychopathology, but the strong link between adhd and other neurodevelopmental disorders is also substantially driven by unique genetic influences. although attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (adhd) is classified as a neurodevelopmental disorder in the latest diagnostic manuals, it shows phenotypic and genetic associations of similar magnitudes across neurodevelopmental, externalising and internalising disorders. in this study, we aimed to investigate whether there are associations between adhd and serum levels of soluble intercellular adhesion molecules (s-icams) which have important role in inflammatory diseases. in multivariate models adjusting for age, sex, sociodemographics, allergic disease and healthcare utilization, ad was associated with add/adhd in both children [adjusted odds ratio (95% confidence interval), 1·14 (1·03-1·26)] and adults [1·61 (1·25-2·06)]. attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (adhd) is the most frequently diagnosed neuropsychiatric disorder of childhood. attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (adhd) is a neurodevelopmental disorder, being one of the most prevalent psychiatric disorders in childhood. ad was most strongly associated with severe adhd. attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (adhd) is one of the most frequently reported neuropsychiatric disorders in childhood. attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (adhd) is the most commonly diagnosed neurobehavioral disorder of childhood. attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (adhd) is a common childhood-oneset psychiatric disease, characterized by excessive overactivity, inattention, and impulsiveness. most symptoms of adhd are thought to be associated with a dysbalance between the neurotransmitters noradrenaline and dopamine in the brain. |||",Yes
Can injections with the enzyme collagenase straighten fingers bent by Dupuytren's disease without surgery? (Reader inquiry),Yes,"Justification: The context provides evidence that collagenase injections are a minimally invasive treatment option for Dupuytren's contracture, a condition that causes bent fingers. The enzyme collagenase has been shown to be effective in reducing joint contractures and improving the range of motion in affected joints. The treatment involves percutaneous injection of collagenase, which cleaves collagen fibers, leading to weakening and eventual rupture of the fibrous cords responsible for the contracture. The context also mentions a case of a 61-year-old male who achieved significant improvement after collagenase injection. Therefore, it can be concluded that injections with the enzyme collagenase can straighten fingers bent by Dupuytren's disease without surgery.","collagenase injections are used as a minimally invasive treatment for dupuytren contracture of the palm and fingers, with good published success. several studies have investigated the clinical outcome after collagenase treatment for dupuytren's disease in terms of range of motion of the affected finger. we present a case of a 61-year-old right hand-dominant male with a 2-year history of isolated right small finger dupuytren's contracture at the dip joint who achieved significant improvement after collagenase injection. collagenase injection is a frequently used option for minimally invasive treatment of dupuytren's disease with greater than a 20-degree joint contracture. we present early results on the treatment of dupuytren's contracture using injectable collagenase. in the short-term collagenase is an effective, well-tolerated   and safe alternative to surgery for dupuytren's disease of the thumb. this   prospective study reports on the short-term safety and efficacy   of collagenase treatment in five thumb and first web space dupuytren's   contractures. in recent years, the enzyme collagenase has been developed for the percutaneous treatment of dupuytren's contracture, allowing management of the condition as an outpatient. collagenase is a safe and effective outpatient-based treatment for dupuytren's contracture, which may be useful in controlling surgical waiting lists. collagenase injection is a safe and effective treatment option for dupuytren disease, but recurrence is common especially for the pip joint. injection of collagenase clostridium histolyticum, an office-based, nonsurgical option, may reduce joint contractures caused by dupuytren's disease. bacterial collagenase has recently been proven beneficial for treating dupuytren's disease, cleaving the collagen fibers at different sites, with weakening and eventually rupture of the fibrous cords after manipulation. injectable collagenase is an alternative to surgical   treatment for dupuytren's disease. higher hand function at baseline (r2 = 0.31) and less flexion contracture (r2 = 0.46) were identified as positive predictors for the outcome 1 year after collagenase treatment for dupuytren's disease. nonsurgical treatment of dupuytren's disease using collagenase clostridium histolyticum (cch). the aim of our study was to investigate the relation between finger’s contracture degree and success of surgical treatment of the dupuytren's disease. while dupuytren's disease can cause disabling contractures requiring open surgery, a less-invasive option using clostridium histolyticum collagenase (chc) via percutaneous injection was recently reported. collagenase clostridium histolyticum significantly reduced contractures and improved the range of motion in joints affected by advanced dupuytren's disease. this technique offers simple surgical control of progressive and recurrent dupuytren's contracture of the fingers with minimal postoperative morbidity. the aim of the present study was to identify predictors of patient-reported as well as objective clinical outcome in patients 1 year after collagenase treatment for dupuytren's disease. |||",Yes
Is it harmful to health to eat apple cores with the apple?,No,"The context suggests that apple consumption, including the peels, is associated with numerous health benefits. The peels, which are part of the apple core, contain high concentrations of phenolic compounds that may assist in the prevention of chronic diseases, including cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, obesity, and cancer. The study also mentions that apple peels should not be discarded from the diet. However, it is important to note that the context also mentions the risk of a mycotoxin, patulin, produced by a mold that invades wounded apples. Therefore, it is advisable to avoid consuming damaged or decayed parts of the apple, including the core if it appears to be affected. Overall, the context does not suggest that eating apple cores is harmful to health, but it is important to ensure that the apple is not damaged or decayed.","these results, support the regular consumption of whole apples as an aid in the prevention of cvd. apples are among the world's most consumed fruits. this narrative review summarizes a novel integrated view of whole-apple intake, cvd risk association (through observational studies; oss), and the effects on cvd risk factors (randomized trials; rts). apples and apple-based products are among the most popular foods around the world for their delightful flavors and health benefits. in 8 oss, whole-apple intake was associated with a reduced risk of cvd mortality, ischemic heart disease mortality, stroke mortality, all-cause mortality, and severe abdominal aortic calcification, as well as with lower c-reactive protein (crp) concentrations. the saying ""an apple a day keeps the doctor away"" has been known for over 150 years, and numerous studies have shown that apple consumption is closely associated with reduced risks of chronic diseases. apple is among the most consumed fruits worldwide. thus, consuming between 100 and 150 g/day of whole apples is associated with a lower cvd risk and decreases in blood pressure, pulse pressure, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and inflammation status as well as with increases in hdlc and endothelial function. apple peels have high concentrations of phenolic compounds and may assist in the prevention of chronic diseases. studies have shown an inverse relationship between the consumption of apples and the risk of several cancers. apples abundant in phenolic compounds show a variety of biological activities that may contribute to health beneficial effects against cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, obesity and cancer. in 8 rts, whole-apple consumption reduced total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, systolic blood pressure, pulse pressure, and plasma inflammatory cytokines, and noticeably reduced crp, whereas it increased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (hdlc) and improved endothelial function. our data suggested that ape possesses strong antiproliferative effects against cancer cells, and apple peels should not be discarded from the diet. apple proliferation is an economically important disease and a threat for commercial apple cultivation. this study tested how consuming preloads of apples in different forms prior to a meal (apple, applesauce, and apple juice with and without added fiber) influences satiety and energy intake at meal. apple pomace is a rich source of health-benefitting nutrients, including minerals, dietary fiber, antioxidants, and ursolic acid, which suggests it has potential use as a dietary supplement, functional food, and/or food additive. however, while the impact of whole-apple intake on cardiovascular disease (cvd) remains unknown. however, the commonly found mold, penicillium expansum invades wounded apples, causing the blue mold decay and ensuing the production of patulin, a mycotoxin that negatively affects human health. millions of pounds of waste apple peels are generated in the production of applesauce and canned apples in new york state each year. fresh apples can cause birch pollen-related food allergy in northern and central european populations, primarily because of the presence of mal d 1, the major apple allergen that is cross-reactive to the homologous and sensitizing allergen bet v 1 from birch. |||",No
Can taking selenium prevent cancer?,No,"The potential of selenium in preventing cancer has been a subject of extensive research. Selenium has been shown to have chemo-preventive properties and has been effective in reducing the incidence of cancer in animal models and human clinical trials. It has been suggested that selenium supplementation may contribute to cancer preventive effects, particularly for prostate cancer. However, it is important to note that the molecular basis for these effects remains unclear. While epidemiological and clinical data suggest a reduced cancer incidence and mortality with higher selenium exposure, supplementation trials have not indicated a clear benefit. Therefore, while selenium may have a role in cancer prevention, further research is needed to establish its efficacy.","selenium has been shown to prevent cancer in a variety of animal model systems. these findings support the hypothesis that oral selenium supplementation may contribute to the cancer preventive effects of selenium. the efficacy of selenium supplementation for cancer prevention in women and men? selenium has been claimed to have chemo-preventive properties. selenium supplementation did not reduce skin cancer rates, but the incidence of total, lung, colorectal, and prostate cancers was significantly reduced by the intervention. the micronutrient element selenium (se) has been shown to be effective in reducing the incidence of cancer in animal models and human clinical trials. daily supplementation with the essential trace mineral selenium significantly reduced prostate cancer risk in men in the nutritional prevention of cancer trial. to date, there is no convincing evidence that selenium supplements can prevent cancer in men, women or children. a recent well-controlled intervention trial studied whether selenium supplementation can prevent cancer in subjects who have a history of skin cancer and live in areas of the united states with low soil selenium levels. higher selenium exposure and selenium supplements have been suggested to protect against several types of cancers. selenium (se) is a chemo-preventive agent that has been shown to have a protective role against cancer. the trace element selenium is suggested having cancer prevention activity and used as food supplement. selenium (se) has long been known for its cancer prevention properties, but the molecular basis remains unclear. the dietary trace element selenium has been proposed to be a potential chemopreventive agent for prostate cancer. there is considerable interest in the trace element selenium as a possible cancer chemopreventive dietary component, but supplementation trials have not indicated a clear benefit. epidemiological and clinical data suggest that selenium may prevent prostate cancer, but the biological effects of selenium on normal or malignant prostate cells are not well known. in epidemiologic data, we found a reduced cancer incidence (summary odds ratio (or) 0.69 (95% confidence interval (ci) 0.53 to 0.91) and mortality (or 0.55, 95% ci 0.36 to 0.83) with higher selenium exposure. recent evidence suggests that selenium may mediate its chemopreventive effects by inducing apoptosis in human prostate cancer cells. in these studies, selenium supplementation has been shown to be beneficial in reducing the frequency of dna adducts and chromosome breaks, consequentially reducing the likelihood of detrimental mutations that ultimately contribute to carcinogenesis. the trace element selenium is an essential micronutrient that has received considerable attention for its potential use in the prevention of cancer. |||",No

Do general health checkups lead to longer life?,No,", with caveats

     Justification: The context suggests that the benefits of general health checkups, including periodic health examinations, can lead to health benefits for elderly persons. The earlier detection of disease may result in more cures or longer survival. Compared with no follow-up, the current schedule showed a gain in life expectancy with a range from 0.3 years to 1.5 years that decreased with advancing age. However, it is important to note that the benefits of health checkups depend on the individual's general health and life expectancy. Additionally, there is little information to indicate whether frequent visits to the doctor's office or frequent testing improves survival or quality of life. Therefore, while general health checkups can lead to longer life, it is not a guarantee and depends on various factors.","individuals who have periodic health examinations (""check-ups"") with physicians even if they feel well have higher rates of screening and other preventive services than individuals who only see physicians when ill. what are the benefits and harms of general health checks for adult populations? the results suggest that additional appropriate clinical tests may improve the effectiveness of physical checkups and thus result in health benefits for elderly persons. in general, the benefits of such efforts have become more apparent, but depend also upon general health and life expectancy of the individual. with increasing life expectancy over the past 50 years, screening for treatable illness and active measures to prevent disease and promote a healthy lifestyle have become increasingly important for older patients. compared with usual care, offers of health checks were not associated with lower rates of all-cause mortality, mortality from cardiovascular disease, or mortality from cancer. patients at high risk of disease may benefit from targeted health checks in general practice. health checks may promote a fluid patient-provider relationship, improve the delivery of some preventive measures, and reduce the patient's anxiety. this study assessed whether individuals' beliefs about the advisability of periodic health examinations contribute to the likelihood that they receive recommended clinical preventive services. people's beliefs about the value of periodic health examinations are associated with the likelihood that they receive recommended preventative services. to determine whether some health behaviors of older people (e.g., obtaining cancer screens) have a limited and others (e.g., exercise) have a broad association with population-level health status 4 to 6 years later. this possibility has led to public health programs which recommend populations to have periodic screening examinations for detecting specific chronic diseases, for example, cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease and so on. the general health check, which includes the periodic health visit and annual physical exam, is not recommended to maintain the health of asymptomatic adults with no risk factors. health checks may be associated with more diagnoses and more drug treatment. the earlier detection of disease may lead to more cures or longer survival. they range from periodic health evaluations with a general physician, through the screening and diagnostic tests derived from these visits, to broader screening programs. this article attempts to answer six questions about the periodic health examination in order to establish whether it is of enough value to warrant the time spent. compared with no follow-up, the current schedule showed a gain in life expectancy with a range from 0.3 years to 1.5 years that decreased with advancing age. practice of health behaviors with a broader focus is associated, at a population level, with better functional status and self-rated health and lower rates of hospitalization and death 4 to 6 years later. there is little information to indicate whether frequent visits to the doctor's office or frequent testing improves survival or quality of life. |||",No
Can dementia be prevented?,No,"The context suggests that dementia prevention is possible, particularly in the preclinical stage, through the identification and manipulation of modifiable risk factors. These factors include low education, midlife hearing loss, obesity, hypertension, late-life depression, smoking, physical inactivity, diabetes, and social isolation. The prevention of dementia is critical, as current interventions are not able to modify the disease. Vascular risk factor management, lifestyle changes, and drugs could be employed together to delay the onset of dementia syndromes. However, the 2017 National Academy of Medicine report concluded that the current evidence is limited and there are no specific interventions to warrant a public health recommendation for dementia prevention. Therefore, while dementia prevention is possible, more research is needed to clarify the potential of these factors to mitigate risk and determine the mechanisms that link these factors to dementia.","whether therapies will prevent some dementia can be determined. is it possible to prevent atrophy of key brain regions related to cognitive decline and alzheimer's disease (ad)? recently, it has been suggested that up to a third of the dementia cases might be preventable. the prevention of dementia is of critical importance. based on results from large cohort studies and using population attributable risk, the commission concluded that up to 35% of dementia cases could be prevented by modifying nine risk factors: low education, midlife hearing loss, obesity, hypertension, late-life depression, smoking, physical inactivity, diabetes, and social isolation. while prevention is always better than cure, this is particularly important in the field of dementia, as current interventions are not able to modify the disease. until a cure exists, prevention through the identification and manipulation of modifiable risk factors for dementia, in general, or ad, in particular, will be our only means of reducing dementia prevalence or delaying its onset. at present, vascular risk factor management, lifestyle changes, and drugs could be employed together to delay the onset of dementia syndromes. this article revises the evidence ""for"" and ""against"" dementia primary prevention. prevention of vascular dementia involves treatment of risk factors and the same preventive measures used to avoid heart attacks and strokes. there has been a move in recent years to recognize that the most effective treatment for vascular dementia, and for the mixed component of mixed vascular dementia and alzheimer's disease, lies not in treatment but in prevention. there are evidences that the risk of developing dementia may be reduced by modifiable risk factors. the 2017 national academy of medicine report concluded that the current evidence is limited and there are no specific interventions to warrant a public health recommendation for dementia prevention. clarifying the potential of these factors to mitigate risk as well as determining the mechanisms that link these factors to dementia is expected to lead to new approaches for both preventing and treating neurodegenerative diseases such as alzheimer disease. cognitive impairment associated with vascular disease may be the only preventable form of dementia of late life. however, evidence from large clinical trials is not conclusive to support that a third of dementia cases might be prevented. the possible association of vascular disease with dementia may offer the best preventive high-risk approach. symptomatic treatment during the dementia stage of alzheimer's disease(ad) cannot delay or halt the progression of this disease. while there is no doubt that prevention is desirable, the evidence of the benefits of early intervention and treatment for older hospitalised patients with dementia is unclear. therefore, prevention in the preclinical stage is likely the most effective way to decrease the incidence of this age-associated neurodegenerative condition, and its associated burden for individuals and society. |||",No
Does the plant pigment beta-carotene protect against cancer?,Yes,"Beta-carotene, a plant pigment, has been suggested to have a protective role against cancer. This is supported by numerous studies indicating its potential in cancer prevention. Beta-carotene has been shown to reduce the risk of certain cancers, with its ability to modulate the risk of cancer being highlighted in epidemiological studies. The anticancer activity of beta-carotene is thought to be due to its antioxidant properties or its ability to be converted to vitamin A. In vitro studies have reported that beta-carotene inhibits the growth of cancer cells, although the molecular mechanisms behind this are not yet fully understood. However, it is important to note that while a high intake of beta-carotene from dietary sources has been linked to a lower risk of cancer, supplemental beta-carotene has been found to enhance lung cancer incidence and mortality among smokers.","many studies suggest a protective role of beta-carotene against cancer. evidence supports the potential role of beta-carotene in cancer prevention. several studies suggest that beta-carotene reduces the risk of some cancers. epidemiological studies suggest that beta-carotene is able to modulate the risk of cancer. beta-carotene and other carotenoids have been thought to have anti-cancer activity, either because of antioxidant activity or because of their ability to be converted to vitamin a. dietary beta-carotene has been shown to have cancer chemopreventive action on the basis of epidemiologic evidence and studies in animals. there is a growing body of interest on the role of beta-carotene and other carotenoids in human chronic diseases, including cancer. beta-carotene, a quencher of excited species such as singlet oxygen and free radicals, has been reported to protect against cutaneous photodamage, including sunburn acutely and photocarcinogenesis chronically. a number of in vitro studies reported that beta-carotene inhibits the growth of cancer cells; however, so far little is known about the molecular mechanisms of the antiproliferative effect of beta-carotene. we hypothesized that beta-carotene may act as a pro- or anticancerogenic agent by modulating pathways involved in cell growth and that such a modulation may involve a redox mechanism. basic research has demonstrated that beta-carotene can trap organic free radicals and/or deactivate excited oxygen molecules which may have an anticancer effect by preventing tissue damage. it has been implied that the antiperoxidative activity of beta-carotene is important for its ability to prevent malignant and cardiovascular diseases. the anticarcinogenic action of carotenoids such as beta-carotene has been frequently ascribed to their antioxidant properties. although epidemiologic studies have demonstrated that a high intake of vegetables containing beta-carotene lowers the risk of cancer, recent intervention studies have revealed that beta-carotene supplementation to smokers resulted in a high incidence of lung cancer. while epidemiological evidence shows that people who ingest more dietary carotenoids exhibit a reduced risk for cancer, results from intervention trials indicate that supplemental beta-carotene enhances lung cancer incidence and mortality among smokers. the present study demonstrates that beta-carotene, a natural pigment widely present in fruit and vegetables, inhibits the growth of several human colon adenocarcinoma cell lines (colo 320 hsr, ls-174, ht-29 and widr) by inducing cell cycle arrest in g(2)/m phase and apoptosis. although the pharmacological role of beta-carotene in the prevention and treatment of colon cancer has received increasing attention, little is known about the molecular mechanisms of action of this carotenoid. dietary beta-carotene acts as a photoprotective agent in the skin, but the exact mechanism of protection is unknown. these results indicate that dietary beta-carotene accumulates in the skin and acts as a protective agent against uv-a-induced oxidative damage, by quenching the (1)o(2). the various epidemiological studies suggested that high beta-carotene intake might reduce the incidence of the cancer risk. |||",No
Can vitamin supplements protect against life-threatening diseases such as cancer or cardiovascular disease?,No,"The evidence suggests that while antioxidant vitamins, whether obtained through regular diet or as food supplements, may have a role in the prevention of cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and cataract formation, their supplementation has not been proven to have beneficial effects in the primary prevention of myocardial infarction and stroke. This is based on randomized controlled trials, which are considered the gold standard for evaluating the effectiveness of interventions. Furthermore, high doses of vitamin supplementation may cause toxic effects in some instances. Therefore, it cannot be concluded that vitamin supplements protect against life-threatening diseases such as cancer or cardiovascular disease.","do antioxidant vitamins, in regular food or as food supplements, protect against myocardial infarction and stroke? the prospect that high intake of certain vitamins may confer protection against cancer has drawn substantial attention during the last decades. some good-quality cohort studies have reported an association between the use of vitamin supplements and lower risk for cardiovascular disease. this paper gives a concise update of the role of a number of promising vitamins in prevention of cancer. chronic human health problems, namely arteriosclerosis, myocardial ischemia, and cancer, may be caused by highly active oxygen species and may be preventable by antioxidant vitamins. increasing evidence is accumulating that a synergistic role of the so-called antioxidant vitamins (c, e, beta-carotene) may have a dominant role in the prevention of cancer, cardiovascular diseases and cataract formation. higher intake of fruits and vegetables is associated with reduced risk of specific types of cancer and of cardiovascular disease (cvd), but the protective role of the vitamins contained in fruits and vegetables on cvd is controversial. dietary supplements at high doses as part of medical therapy have been controversial, but the evidence suggests that they play a significant role in prevention and treatment of diseases as well as protection from accelerated aging that results from oxygen free-radical damage, inflammation, and glycation. in observational studies (case-control or cohort design), people with high intake of antioxidant vitamins by regular diet or as food supplements generally have a lower risk of myocardial infarction and stroke than people who are low-consumers of antioxidant vitamins. epidemiological data suggest that diets rich in antioxidants protect against diseases associated with free radical damage, including cancer, cardiovascular disease and diabetes. antioxidant vitamins are thought to play a role in atherosclerosis. the production of free radicals may favour the processes of atherosclerosis, and antioxidant vitamins (including beta-carotene), which partly prevent such processes, might favorably influence cardiovascular disease (cvd); thus, their supplementation might be a useful tool in the prevention of coronary heart disease (chd). growing evidence suggest that antioxidant vitamins might reduce the risk of disease outcomes by their ability to scavenge free radicals. foods rich in vitamins, especially those containing beta carotene and vitamin c, lower the risk of cancer in humans. evidence from several lines of research indicates a role for vitamin c in the prevention of some types of cancer in addition to a possible role in hypercholesterolemia and other conditions. supplementation of these nutrients has been explored as a means of reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. however, several recent studies have failed to demonstrate the efficacy of vitamin supplementation in preventing several types of cancer. vitamin supplementation at doses higher than the recommended daily allowance is, at present, an unknown factor in preventing cancer and may cause toxic effects in some instances. in randomized controlled trials, however, antioxidant vitamins as food supplements have no beneficial effects in the primary prevention of myocardial infarction and stroke. in this systematic literature review on the effects of antioxidant vitamins in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disorders, studies with ischaemic heart disease, stroke or combined cardiovascular events as end-points have been included. |||",No
Is it true that lowering cholesterol does not reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease?,No,"The reduction of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) has been associated with a decrease in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Trial evidence shows that effective lowering of serum total cholesterol and particularly of LDL cholesterol is important for the prevention of total mortality, coronary artery disease mortality, and major coronary events. Clinical and angiographic intervention trials have now ascertained that lowering LDL cholesterol is effective in prevention and in secondary treatment of coronary atherosclerosis. However, it is uncertain whether pharmacological reductions in very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDLs) and their component triglyceride and cholesterol could reduce residual risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events among individuals in whom LDL-C has been adequately lowered. Additionally, specific genetic variants that raise HDL-C levels are not clearly associated with reduced risk of coronary heart disease. There is no evidence yet that lowering LDL and raising HDL alleviate that risk.","however, recent clinical studies of statin-treated subjects with established atherosclerosis cast doubt on the hypothesis that elevating hdl cholesterol levels reduces cvd risk. many lines of evidence indicate that low levels of hdl cholesterol increase the risk of cardiovascular disease (cvd). hypercholesterolemia is a major risk factor for coronary heart disease, and data indicate that aggressive cholesterol reduction decreases mortality and morbidity associated with this disease. the benefits of decreasing cholesterol to very low levels are not yet certain, although epidemiologic reviews strongly correlate lower cholesterol levels with lowered coronary artery disease mortality. there is broad evidence that lowering low-density lipoprotein (ldl) cholesterol will reduce cardiovascular risk. despite the impressive relation between an increased blood cholesterol and increased mortality from coronary artery disease and despite the persuasive results of cholesterol-lowering trials in secondary prevention, there are increasing reservations about the wisdom of lowering moderately raised blood cholesterol levels in patients who have no symptoms of coronary artery disease. epidemiologic evidence links high levels of low density lipoprotein (ldl) cholesterol and low levels of high density lipoprotein (hdl) cholesterol to increased risk of coronary heart disease. hypercholesterolemia, particularly an elevated level of low-density lipoprotein (ldl) cholesterol, is an unarguably established risk factor for coronary artery disease (cad). measurements of low levels of high-density lipoprotein (hdl) cholesterol have been identified as a risk factor for premature coronary artery disease, however, to date, current pharmacologic approaches for raising hdl have provided little benefit, if at all, in reducing cardiovascular outcomes. t***he current control of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol among patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease is very low and this is associated with an increase of cardiovascular outcomes. however, several large studies recently revealed that pharmacologic interventions that increase hdl-c concentration have not improved cardiovascular outcomes when added to standard therapy. the reduction of low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (ldl-chol) has been associated with a decrease in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. trial evidence shows that effective lowering of serum total cholesterol and particularly of low-density lipoprotein (ldl) cholesterol is important for the prevention of total mortality, coronary artery disease mortality, and major coronary events. it is uncertain whether pharmacological reductions in very-low-density lipoproteins (vldls), and their component triglyceride and cholesterol could reduce residual risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ascvd) events among individuals in whom low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (ldl-c) has been adequately lowered. to minimize chd risk, elevated blood pressure and atherogenic lipid levels should be lowered, but various antihypertensive agents appear to adversely affect lipid levels, actually precluding the chd risk reduction expected from blood pressure control. aggressive treatment of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (ldl-c) fails to prevent most cardiovascular (cv) events. clinical and angiographic intervention trials have now ascertained that lowering ldl cholesterol is effective in prevention and in secondary treatment of coronary atherosclerosis. in addition, specific genetic variants that raise hdl-c levels are not clearly associated with reduced risk of coronary heart disease. there is no evidence--yet--that lowering ldl and raising hdl alleviate that risk. there is no sound evidence that reduction of serum cholesterol below 200-210 mg/dl will reduce ihd incidence. |||",No

Is combined hormone therapy with estrogen and progestin safe for women in late menopause (after the last menstrual period)?,No,", but with caveats.

     Combined hormone therapy with estrogen and progestin can be safe for women in late menopause, but it is important to note that there are safety and tolerability concerns associated with this treatment. While estrogen, with or without a progestin, is effective for the treatment of menopausal symptoms, the use of unopposed estrogens has been linked to an increased risk of endometrial cancer. As a result, many women opt for combined estrogen-progestogen therapy instead. However, prolonged use of sequential hormone replacement therapy with estrogen combined with progestogen for 10 to 24 days per month may elevate the risk of endometrial cancer relative to those who have never received hormone replacement therapy. It is also important to note that the use of estrogens in postmenopausal women has been the subject of much controversy regarding hormone formulation, dosage, use in combination with progestins, duration of treatment, and contraindications. Therefore, it is crucial to consult with a healthcare provider to determine the most appropriate treatment plan for individual needs and circumstances.","although hormone therapy using estrogens plus progestogens (ept) is effective for the management of menopausal symptoms (e.g., vasomotor symptoms and vulvar/vaginal atrophy) and prevention/treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis, ept is associated with safety and tolerability concerns. estrogen, with or without a progestin, is effective for the treatment of menopausal symptoms. while there are a number of benefits to the health of postmenopausal women from use of unopposed estrogens, the increased risk of endometrial cancer related to these hormones has led many women to use combined estrogen-progestogen therapy instead, or not to use hormones at all. to evaluate the effect of a 17beta-estradiol(e2)/norgestimate (ngm) hrt regimen, which provides constant estrogen in combination with pulsed progestin administration, on endometrial histology in healthy postmenopausal women 40 to 65 years of age who had experienced natural menopause at least 12 months before the start of the study. postmenopausal women who receive sequential hormone replacement therapy with estrogen combined with progestogen for 10 to 24 d/mo for a prolonged period may have an elevated endometrial cancer risk relative to those who have never received hormone replacement therapy. hormone replacement therapy (hrt) with estrogen alleviates menopausal symptoms and is effective in reducing osteoporosis and cardiovascular disease when taken in early postmenopause. there is some increased risk of endometrial cancer from estrogen-replacement therapy; however, added progestin decreases this risk to less than that observed in untreated postmenopausal women. older, late postmenopausal women who never previously received hrt are also believed to benefit from estrogen treatment. the use of estrogens in postmenopausal women has been the subject of much controversy regarding hormone formulation, dosage, use in combination with progestins, duration of treatment, and contraindications. the use of estrogens in postmenopausal women has been the subject of much controversy regarding hormone formulation, dosage, use in combination with progestins, duration of treatment, and contraindications. both positive and negative outcomes of hormone therapy are reported in postmenopausal women. to critically review the risks and benefits of hormone therapy for asymptomatic postmenopausal women who are considering long-term hormone therapy to prevent disease or to prolong life. hormone therapy (ht) is prescribed during or after menopausal transition to replace the decline in estrogen and progesterone levels. hormone replacement therapy may increase the quality of life of postmenopausal women. menopausal hormone therapy (mht) is the most effective method of treating vasomotor symptoms and other climacteric symptoms related to estrogen deficiency in peri- and postmenopausal period. a total of 1,253 postmenopausal women were randomized to receive either continuous 1 mg e2, or constant estrogen, pulsed progestin regimens of 1 mg e2/30 microg ngm, 1 mg e2/90 microg ngm, or 1 mg e2/180 microg ngm (3 days on, 3 days off) in a 12-month, multicenter, double-blind study. progestins are included in menopausal hormone replacement therapy to counteract the increased risk for endometrial cancer associated with estrogen replacement therapy. both estrogens and progestins are effective in retarding the progression of osteoporosis, but estrogen-progestin combination therapy may promote new bone formation. postmenopausal women with vasomotor and vaginal symptoms are commonly treated with estrogens or combined estrogen/progestin therapy (hormone therapy). we investigated whether daily use of estrogen and progestogen (continuous combined hormone replacement therapy) could diminish any excess endometrial cancer risk. |||",No
Can negative expectancy reduce the effect of pain medications?,No,"Research has shown that negative expectancy can indeed reduce the effect of pain medications. This phenomenon is known as the nocebo effect, where negative expectations about a treatment can lead to a decrease in its effectiveness. Negative preconceived beliefs about the benefits of pain medications, such as morphine, have been associated with reports of severe pain and poor patient satisfaction. Interventions designed to change patients' expectations have been found to have a small effect on pain experience. It is hypothesized that placebos reduce pain by reducing negative emotions, and the new aspect of this model is that expectations reduce negative emotions, which in turn reduce symptoms. Therefore, managing patient expectations through strategies such as providing enhanced information and optimizing patient-physician communication can help to prevent, minimize, or extinguish the nocebo effect in clinical settings.","pain expectancy may be an important variable that has been found to influence the effectiveness of treatments for pain. an expectation variable with three categories was calculated: realistic expectations were those whose expected reduction in pain was similar to the observed mean group reduction in pain, while optimistic and pessimistic expectations were those who over- or under-estimated the expected response to treatment, respectively. background: nocebo effects contribute to a large proportion of the non-specific side-effects attributed to medications and are mainly generated through negative expectations. negative emotions increase pain, and it is hypothesized that placebos reduce pain by reducing negative emotions, i.e. previous reviews show that interventions designed to change participants' expectations have a small effect on pain experience. negative preconceived beliefs about the benefits of morphine use are frequently seen in hospitalized patients and may be associated with reports of severe pain, poor patient satisfaction, impaired rehabilitation, and possibly more chronic postsurgical pain. decreasing unrealistic side-effect expectations may lead to decreased experience of side-effects and increased adherence to medical interventions. this narrative review focuses on underlying mechanisms and possible factors that contribute to the susceptibility to the nocebo effect on pain and related outcomes and suggests strategies that can prevent, minimize, or extinguish nocebo effects in clinical settings. examining the relationship between expectations between pain and disability in a large cohort of patients with neuropathic pain. the new aspect of the presented model is the hypothesis that expectations reduce negative emotions, and that negative reinforcement that involves the dopaminergic reinforcement system should be a contributor to placebo responses. the association between baseline realistic/unrealistic expectations and 6-month pain-related disability, catastrophizing and psychological distress was assessed. patients in pain often fear medications prescribed or recommend to them by their clinicians. first, expectations and impressions about a medication and beliefs about how a medication works, such as delay of onset, can shape a patient's perceived experience with the medication. self-reported side effects of pain medication are important determinants of treatment course that can affect patient adherence, medication discontinuation and physician decisions. however, after adjustment for baseline symptom severity, multivariable analysis revealed that patients with optimistic expectations had lower levels of disability, than those with realistic expectations. the hypothesis put forth is that expectations of treatment effects reduce negative emotions and thereby reduce symptoms, e.g. evidence from clinical and experimental studies lead to various recommendations and strategies to alter the nocebo effect in order to optimize pain treatments, such as providing patients with enhanced information, optimizing patient-physician communication and relationships, and offering psychoeducation on coping skills in order to manage patient expectations. to identify factors associated with side-effect expectations. in this study, the physiological and behavioral consequences of chronic pain and its treatment with opioids, along with guidelines for prescribing opioid pain medication, are presented. the fear of a patient developing opioid tolerance contributes regularly to the stigmatization and withholding of intrathecal opioid therapy for chronic pain of non-cancer origin. |||",No
Is sex as good an endurance workout as running?,No,"The context provided does not directly address the question of whether sexual activity is as good an endurance workout as running. However, it does provide information on the endurance performance of men and women in running. It is established that women have greater muscular endurance than men in low to moderate intensity contractions, and are less fatigable in single-joint exercises. Additionally, it is noted that women exhibit less peripheral fatigue in the plantar flexors than men after a 110-km ultra-trail-running race. These findings suggest that women may have a greater capacity for endurance in certain activities. However, without specific data on the physiological demands of sexual activity and how they compare to running, it is not possible to definitively answer the question.","we tested the hypothesis that endurance exercise in men is also associated with alterations in reproductive function. we conclude that this level of strenuous, long-term endurance exercise does not have major adverse effects on reproductive function in men. in conclusion, sex and exercise intensity influence the fmd response to acute aerobic exercise in older adults. the lower level of fatigue in the knee extensors and peripheral fatigue in the plantar flexors could partly explain the reports of better performance in females in extreme duration running races as race distance increases. together, these findings do not support the need of sex-specific training interventions to increase the tolerance to neuromuscular fatigue in half-marathoners. background: beyond the difference in marathon performance when comparing female and male runners, we tested the hypothesis that running strategy does not different according to sex. forsyth, jj and burt, d. sex differences in recovery from sprint interval exercise. here we investigated sex differences in central and peripheral fatigue and in rate of force development (rfd) in the knee extensors after a half-marathon run. it has been shown that females have greater muscular endurance than males and that this advantage is eliminated when blood flow is restricted. females exhibited less peripheral fatigue in the plantar flexors than males did after a 110-km ultra-trail-running race and males demonstrated a greater decrease in maximal force loss in the knee extensors. the purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that sex modulates the fmd response to acute aerobic exercise in older adults. recent studies indicate that more men than women run fast relative to sex- specific world records and that this sex difference has been historically stable in elite u.s. runners. women are capable of longer endurance times compared with men for contractions performed at low to moderate intensities. women are known to be less fatigable than men in single-joint exercises, but fatigue induced by running has not been well understood. to compare the relative contributions of their functional capacities to performance in relation to sex, two groups of middle-distance runners (24 men and 14 women) were selected on the basis of performances over 1500-m and 3000-m running races. it was concluded that the greater sex-specific, essential body fat of women is one determinant of the sex difference in metabolic responses to running and distance running performance. the extent to which differences between men and women in cardiorespiratory capacity (vo2max in ml x min-1 x kg ffw-1), percent fat, and running economy (vo2 in ml x min-1 x kg bw-1 at 188 m x min-1) account for the sex difference in 12-min run performance was investigated in 34 male and 34 female recreational runners, 19-35 yr of age. it is unknown if sex differences in dynamic endurance exist during low-load blood flow restricted (bfr) resistance exercise. if the observed differences between men and women on these variables are truly a function of sex, results of this study provide a biological basis for different distance running performance expectations for men and women. these findings might aid coaches and ultra-marathon runners set long-term training goals considering their sex and age. |||",No
"Does processed red meat (sausages, ham, bacon) increase the risk of cardiovascular disease???",Yes,"Numerous studies have demonstrated a possible association between processed red meat consumption and cardiovascular disease (CVD). The high sodium content of processed red meat could increase blood pressure and explain the association with CVD. In meta-analyses of prospective cohorts, higher risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) is seen with processed meat consumption, but a smaller increase or no risk is seen with unprocessed meat consumption. Women who consumed ≥5 servings of processed red meat/wk had a 17% higher rate of hypertension than that of women who consumed <1 serving/wk. The overall findings suggest that processed meat consumption is not beneficial for cardiometabolic health, and that clinical and public health guidance should especially prioritize reducing processed meat consumption.","high processed red meat consumption is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease. numerous studies demonstrated a possible association between red meat consumption and cardiovascular disease (cvd). the assessment of the actual contribution of red or processed meat to increasing the risk of suffering cardiovascular diseases (cvd) requires identification of specific harmful components and their underlying pathological mechanisms. we evaluated the relation between the consumption of unprocessed and processed red meat and incident hypertension. the high sodium content of processed red meat could increase blood pressure and explain the association with cardiovascular disease. growing evidence suggests that effects of red meat consumption on coronary heart disease (chd) and type 2 diabetes could vary depending on processing. red meat has been associated with an increased cardiovascular disease (cvd) risk, possibly through gut microbial-derived trimethylamine-n-oxide (tmao). the present review aims to provide an updated overview, including evidence, controversies and unresolved questions on both the epidemiology and mechanisms relating red and processed meat consumption to cvd. in similar analyses, both unprocessed red and processed meat consumption are associated with incident diabetes, with higher risk per g of processed (rr per 50 g: 1.51, 95 %ci = 1.25-1.83) versus unprocessed (rr per 100 g: 1.19, 95 % ci = 1.04-1.37) meats. this review will evaluate the association between red meat consumption and incidence of cvd and mortality (primary outcome measures). in meta-analyses of prospective cohorts, higher risk of chd is seen with processed meat consumption (rr per 50 g: 1.42, 95 %ci = 1.07-1.89), but a smaller increase or no risk is seen with unprocessed meat consumption. women who consumed ≥5 servings of processed red meat/wk (50 g = 1 serving) had a 17% higher rate of hypertension than that of women who consumed <1 serving/wk (hr: 1.17; 95% ci: 1.09, 1.26; p-trend = 0.0002). red and (particularly) processed meats are high in cholesterol and saturated and solid fatty acids. we reviewed the evidence for effects of unprocessed (fresh/frozen) red and processed (using sodium/other preservatives) meat consumption on chd and diabetes. the findings of this systematic review will summarize the latest evidence of the association between red meat consumption and incidence of cvd and mortality and the dose-response effect through a systematic review and meta-analysis. the overall findings suggest that neither unprocessed red nor processed meat consumption is beneficial for cardiometabolic health, and that clinical and public health guidance should especially prioritize reducing processed meat consumption. epidemiological studies suggest that red and processed meat consumption is related to an increased risk of type 2 diabetes. the increased risk associated with processed meat compared with red meat suggests that there are interactions between the saturated fat, salt, and nitrates in processed meat and iron, ages and tmao. a high consumption of red and/or processed meat is associated with a higher risk to develop several chronic diseases in which oxidative stress, trimethylamine-n-oxide (tmao) and/or inflammation are involved. regular consumption of red meat has been associated in epidemiologic studies with increased risks of coronary heart disease (chd) and colon and other cancers; possible mechanisms may involve dietary cholesterol, saturated fat, heme iron, and the presence of carcinogens formed in cooking. |||",Yes
Does psychotherapy help with burnout?,Yes,"The context suggests that psychotherapy, specifically cognitive behavior therapy, is helpful for the emotional exhaustion component of burnout. The study aimed to investigate the association between therapist-level burnout and patient-level treatment outcomes after psychological therapy. The findings imply that the therapy program may have beneficial effects on symptomatology and neuroplasticity of patients with burnout. Counseling and/or coaching may also be helpful for those having burnout without significant depression. The review offers evidence that burnout is a concern for those working in the delivery of psychological interventions. The increasing prevalence of stress-related disorders such as burnout urges the need for specialized treatment approaches. Over half of sampled psychotherapists reported moderate-high levels of burnout. The level of burnout symptoms among all therapists was related to temperament traits, briskness, and perseveration, as well as to perceived social support.","however, cognitive behavior therapy is usually helpful for the emotional exhaustion component of burnout. this study aimed to investigate associations between therapist-level burnout and patient-level treatment outcomes after psychological therapy. it appears that psychotherapists commonly experience some burnout, and personal factors influence burnout development. the findings implicate that the therapy program may have beneficial effects on symptomatology and neuroplasticity of patients with burnout. counseling and/or coaching may be helpful for those having burnout without significant depression. conclusions: the results of the current review offers evidence that burnout is a concern for those working in the delivery of psychological interventions. the level of burnout predicted antidepressant treatment. there are lessons from positive psychology that may be utilized to help counsel those with burnout. this article examines the severity of burnout symptoms and their relationship to temperament traits and social support in a large sample (n = 200) of therapists, selected from professional organizations for gestalt and cognitive-behavioral therapists in poland. burnout is common in mental health professionals and has serious personal and professional consequences. burnout is a serious problem for psychiatrists that has implications for clinical practice and personal health. the aim of the present systematic review was to (a) explore the levels of both burnout and job stress in psychotherapists, (b) identify tools used to measure work-related stress and burnout, and (c) identify personal risk factors for developing burnout among psychotherapists. the increasing prevalence of stress-related disorders such as burnout urges the need for specialized treatment approaches. over half of sampled psychotherapists reported moderate-high levels of burnout, with the majority of results based on quantitative cross-sectional self-report surveys. what is burnout? we examined the prospective association between burnout and antidepressant treatment, as an indicator of clinically significant mental disorder. emotionally taxing job demands place psychotherapists at risk for burnout, often to the detriment of the therapist, clients, and the profession of psychotherapy (maslach, 2007). according to our results, we have shown that total burnout scores and emotional exhaustion (ee) scores were significantly higher in psychiatrists with sct. the level of burnout symptoms among all therapists was related to temperament traits, briskness, and perseveration, as well as to perceived social support. articles concerning the prevalence and cause(s) of burnout in applied psychologists, that were published in the english language were included. |||",Yes
Can vitamin and nutrient supplements prevent the eye disease age-related macular degeneration?,No,"The Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) has demonstrated that oral supplementation with antioxidant vitamins and minerals can have beneficial effects on the development of advanced age-related macular degeneration (AMD) in individuals with at least intermediate AMD. The treatment of dry AMD is primarily based on vitamin supplementation. The evidence suggests that antioxidant vitamin and mineral supplementation can slow the progression of AMD, particularly in individuals with moderate to severe signs of the disease. Antioxidant nutrients, such as vitamins C and E and beta-carotene, have been shown to be protective of some eye disorders, including AMD. Oral supplementation with the AREDS formulation (antioxidant vitamins C and E, beta-carotene, and zinc) has been shown to reduce the risk of progression to advanced AMD. While the question of whether individuals with AMD should take antioxidant vitamin or mineral supplements to prevent progression of the disease has not been definitively answered by research to date, the available evidence suggests that such supplements may be beneficial in preventing the onset or progression of disabling eye disease.","the age-related eye disease study (areds) demonstrated beneficial effects of oral supplementation with antioxidant vitamins and minerals on the development of advanced age-related macular degeneration (amd) in persons with at least intermediate amd (bilateral large drusen with or without pigment changes). the treatment of dry age-related macular degeneration is based on vitamin supplementation. the objective of this review is to assess the effects of antioxidant vitamin and/or mineral supplementation on the progression of age-related macular degeneration. the objective of this review is to assess the effects of antioxidant vitamin and/or mineral supplementation on the progression of age-related macular degeneration. the objective of this review is to assess the effects of antioxidant vitamin and/or mineral supplementation on the progression of age-related macular degeneration. randomised trials comparing an antioxidant vitamin and/or mineral supplement (alone or in combination) to control in people with age-related macular degeneration are included in this review. randomised trials comparing an antioxidant vitamin and/or mineral supplement (alone or in combination) to control in people with age-related macular degeneration are included in this review. beneficial effects of dietary supplements in age-related macular degeneration (amd) are related to antioxidative properties. the evidence as to the effectiveness of antioxidant vitamin and mineral supplementation in halting the progression of age-related macular degeneration is dominated by one large trial in a relatively well-nourished american population that showed modest benefit in people with moderate to severe signs of the disease. the evidence as to the effectiveness of antioxidant vitamin and mineral supplementation in halting the progression of age-related macular degeneration is dominated by one large trial that showed modest benefit in people with moderate to severe signs of the disease. antioxidant nutrients, such as vitamins c and e and beta-carotene, may be protective of some eye disorders, such as cataract and age-related macular degeneration, but a relationship between these nutrients and dr has yet to be defined. the objective of this review was to assess the effects of antioxidant vitamin or mineral supplementation, or both, on the progression of age-related macular degeneration (amd). these findings raise the possibility that vitamins and trace minerals with antioxidant properties can be of benefit in preventing the onset or progression of disabling eye disease. oral supplementation with the age-related eye disease study (areds) formulation (antioxidant vitamins c and e, beta carotene, and zinc) has been shown to reduce the risk of progression to advanced age-related macular degeneration (amd). the question as to whether people with age-related macular degeneration should take antioxidant vitamin or mineral supplements to prevent progression of the disease has not been answered by research to date. the age-related eye disease study (areds) suggests antioxidants may delay the advance of age-related macular degeneration. observational and experimental data suggest that antioxidant and/or zinc supplements may delay progression of age-related macular degeneration (amd) and vision loss. for this reason, there is considerable interest in determining whether vitamins and trace minerals with antioxidant properties can be of benefit in preventing the onset or progression of disabling eye disease. to assess the effectiveness of antioxidant vitamin supplementation in preventing and slowing the progression of age-related cataract. in the age-related eye disease study 1 (areds 1), a reduced progression to late stage amd was found using vitamin c, e, zinc, and β-carotene. |||",No
Can they delay the progression of eye disease?,Yes,"Justification: The context suggests that various therapeutic interventions, including antioxidants, anti-inflammatory drugs, and gene therapy, have the potential to delay the progression of eye diseases such as cataracts, glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration, and diabetic retinopathy. These interventions can halt or slow down the pathological processes, prevent or delay vision loss, and improve functional vision. The context also mentions that lowering intraocular pressure can slow glaucoma progression, and that early detection and treatment of eye diseases can prevent irreversible damage. Therefore, it can be inferred that these interventions can delay the progression of eye diseases.","eye conditions that are considered progressive and degenerative and for which the causation is generally poorly understood or not understood within conventional medicine can respond to natural therapeutic interventions that result in arrest and/or improvement of morbidity, with enhanced functional results. since the formation of cataract is a well-defined progressive disease, starting with an early refractive change and leading to gradual enhancement of opacification, we hypothesized that even a belated start with an appropriate anti-oxidant could halt the pathological process and delay cataract maturation and vision impairment. anti-inflammatory activity of an antiglaucoma drug may be an advantage for long-term treatment of glaucoma since it may reduce the risk of treatment-related inflammatory processes in outer compartments of the eye and probably also prevent or delay progression of glaucomatous retinal neurodegeneration. it is generally believed that prophylactic intake of antioxidants is beneficial in delaying the onset of some aging manifestations such as cataract. the slowly progressive nature of age-related macular degeneration (amd) means that establishing the efficacy of novel preventative treatments aiming to slow progression of disease, remains challenging, and where earlier endpoints are needed to improve their feasibility. the main goal of glaucoma treatment is to slow the rate of disease so that patients can prolong their functional vision. treatment that targeted the prevention of scarring or ga may improve vision outcomes. the pilot study examined the ability of octreotide to retard progression of diabetic retinopathy (dr) and delay the need for panretinal photocoagulation (prp) in patients with advanced stages of retinal disease. the results of this study demonstrate that retinal degeneration can be stopped, even at late stages of disease. although anti-vascular endothelial growth factor treatment of neovascular age-related macular degeneration (amd) results in improved vision overall, loss of substantial vision can occur. early diagnosis of glaucomatous optic nerve damage offers the potential for early treatment which may prevent vision loss from this neurodegenerative disease. recent gene therapy progress has raised the possibility that vision loss caused by inherited retinal degeneration can be slowed or prevented. early detection, prevention, and monitoring of these manifestations can significantly benefit morbidity associated with such disease states including permanent visual dysfunction. although there have been no randomized clinical trials or other high-quality studies showing the benefits of setting a target iop versus not using this approach, there is ample evidence that lowering iop slows glaucoma progression and, in general, lower is better, regardless of disease stage and baseline iop level. hence, most glaucomatous eyes demonstrate signs of deterioration over time despite what may appear to be adequate treatment. our results suggest that octreotide treatment in euthyroid patients may retard progression of advanced dr and may delay the time to laser surgery. if these are not detected and corrected at an early age, they can lead to an irreversible impairment known as amblyopia (lazy eye). the protection of retinal pigment epithelium (rpe) injury plays an important role in the prevention of or in delaying the pathological progress of retinal degeneration diseases, like age-related macular degeneration (amd), diabetic retinopathy, and retinitis pigmentosa. reliance on intraocular pressure, optic nerve cupping changes, nerve fibre layer integrity, and visual field changes may delay treatment of glaucoma since irreversible changes may have already occurred at the time of diagnosis. in pde6b-deficient retina, this strategy halted degeneration, even when more than 70% of photoreceptors had already degenerated. |||",Yes
Do milk or dairy products promote colon cancer and rectal cancer?,No,"The epidemiological evidence suggests that milk and dairy products have a protective role against colorectal cancer, including colon and rectal cancer. Prospective studies have reported an inverse association between the consumption of total dairy products and milk and the risk of colorectal cancer. The World Cancer Research Fund International/American Institute for Cancer Research states that it is 'probable' that dairy products decrease the risk of colorectal cancer. Furthermore, genetically proxied milk consumption was associated with a reduced risk of colorectal cancer. Therefore, the claim that milk or dairy products promote colon cancer and rectal cancer is not supported by the available evidence.","the aim of this study was to examine the association between milk intake and risk of crc, colon cancer and rectal cancer among women. this review provides an overview of the principal hypotheses and epidemiological evidence of the possible links between colorectal cancer and intake of milk and/or dairy products. our findings strengthen the evidence for a protective role of milk consumption on colorectal cancer risk. prospective studies have reported an inverse association between the consumption of total dairy products and milk and the risk of colorectal cancer (crc). according to world cancer research fund international/american institute for cancer research, it is 'probable' that dairy products decrease the risk of colorectal cancer (crc). our study indicates that there may be a weak inverse association between milk intake and risk of colon cancer among women. we investigated associations of tea, coffee, and milk consumption with colorectal cancer risk and attempted to determine if these exposures were differentially associated with the risks of proximal colon, distal colon, and rectal cancers. observational studies have shown that milk consumption is inversely associated with colorectal, bladder, and breast cancer risk, but positively associated with prostate cancer. whether milk consumption is associated with the risk of prostate, breast, colon, and rectal cancers is unclear and was evaluated in this study. our data indicate that high intakes of lactose and dairy products, particularly milk, are associated with an increased risk of serous ovarian cancer but not of other subtypes of ovarian cancer. we investigated the potential causal associations of milk consumption with the risk of colorectal, bladder, breast, and prostate cancer using a genetic variant near the lct gene as proxy for milk consumption. genetically proxied milk consumption was associated with a reduced risk of colorectal cancer. although case-control studies have reported conflicting results for dairy foods and lactose, several cohort studies have shown positive associations between skim milk, lactose, and ovarian cancer. milk consumption was strongly correlated with incidence rates of prostate cancer (r = 0.65-0.69; all p < 0.0001) and breast cancer (r = 0.64-0.74; all p < 0.0001) in all the nine time periods examined. we examined the association between intakes of dairy products and lactose and the risk of total epithelial ovarian cancer and its subtypes. milk was the dairy product with the strongest positive association with serous ovarian cancer (rate ratio comparing consuming >/=2 glasses milk/d with consuming milk never or seldom: 2.0; 95% ci: 1.1, 3.7; p for trend = 0.04). epidemiological data indicate a potential relationship between milk and dairy product consumption and the incidence of breast cancer, as well as neurodegenerative diseases. the present study does not support an overall substantial effect of milk consumption on the risk of prostate, breast, colon, and rectal cancers at the population level. we assessed consumption of fermented milk, non-fermented milk, cheese, and butter, estimated from semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaires, in relation to prospective risk of breast, prostate, colorectal, smoking-, and obesity-related cancers in 101,235 subjects, including 12,552 cancer cases, in the population-based northern sweden health and disease study. this literature review evaluates the epidemiological and mechanistic evidence linking dairy consumption with breast cancer risk. |||",No
Which of the three most common laser eye surgeries produces the best results and has the fewest side effects?,Yes,"The context does not provide a direct comparison of the three most common laser eye surgeries in terms of best results and fewest side effects.

Electro-acupuncture of the outer ear has been found to be an effective therapeutic option for pain relief. Patients receiving auricular acupuncture reported lower pain scores than those who did not. The results of a prospective, randomized, double-blind, controlled study showed that auricular electroacupuncture relieved pain more effectively than conventional manual auricular acupuncture in chronic low back pain patients. The mechanism of action is thought to be related to the enhancement of acetylcholine secretion, which has anti-inflammatory effects, and the increase of acupuncture analgesia through electrical stimulation of acupuncture points.","conclusions: while study numbers are limited, ear acupuncture, either as stand-alone or as-an-adjunct technique, significantly reduced pain scores and has potential benefits for use in the ed. pain severity was significantly decreased by chinese ear acupuncture throughout intervention period. ear acupuncture enhances the secretion of acetylcholine, which has anti-inflammatory effects. the primary aim of this review was to assess the analgesic efficacy of ear acupuncture in the ed. objective: ear acupuncture might be the form of acupuncture best suited to improving acute pain management in the emergency department (ed). electroacupuncture (ea) is used to relieve various kinds of pain. the results showed that both somatic acupuncture and somatic plus ear acupuncture have a positive effect in reducing pain. there is increasing evidence that somatic acupuncture can be helpful in migraine treatment, but substantial data on ear acupuncture (eap) are still lacking. to ascertain whether ear acupuncture (modified battlefield technique) as an adjunct (adj-bfa) to standard analgesia care (sac) significantly reduces pain scores compared with sham acupuncture (adj-sham) or sac alone, when delivered by medical and nursing practitioners in an ed. in this prospective, randomized, double-blind, controlled study we tested the hypothesis that auricular electroacupuncture (ea) relieves pain more effectively than conventional manual auricular acupuncture (co) in chronic low back pain patients with insufficient pain relief (visual analogue scale [vas] > or = 5) treated with standardized analgesic therapy. to compare the efficacy of chinese and french ear acupuncture in people with chronic back pain. an intervention for this condition is ear acupuncture. acupuncture had a significant effect on otoacoustic emissions in patients with tinnitus. auricular acupuncture is a form of pain relief involving the stimulation of points on the outer ear corresponding with specific body parts. electroacupuncture of the outer ear seems to be an easy-to-use therapeutic option in an age of increasingly invasive and mechanically complex treatments for pad patients. a reduction in physical disability was observed in both ear acupuncture-treated groups during the intervention period and, although chinese ear acupuncture failed to induce significant changes in tissular temperature at individual time points, a significant increase in cutaneous temperature was detected after the follow-up period in the dorsal region of individuals treated with chinese ear acupuncture. electrical stimulation of acupuncture points is considered to increase acupuncture analgesia. electro-acupuncture (ea) can be effective in some pain conditions, but still there have been no randomized controlled studies of ea for treatment of acute postoperative pain in nasal septoplasty. patients receiving auricular acupuncture reported lower pain scores than those who did not at 15 minutes (6.0 [95% confidence interval (ci), 5.4-6.6] vs 2.6 [95% ci, 1.7-3.5]; p < .0001), 6 hours (4.8 [95% ci, 4.0-5.6] vs 2.5 [95% ci, 1.6-3.4]; p = .0005), and 24 hours (4.1 [95% ci, 3.3-4.9] vs 1.3 [95% ci, 1.0-2.8]; p = .0006). these results are the first to demonstrate that continuous ea stimulation of auricular acupuncture points improves the treatment of chronic low back pain in an outpatient population. |||",Yes
Does treatment with the new drug erenumab reduce the number of migraine days per month?,Yes,"The pivotal trials of erenumab in both episodic and chronic migraine demonstrated a significant reduction in monthly migraine days. Treatment with both doses of erenumab (70mg and 140mg) resulted in greater reductions in monthly migraine days compared to placebo. The treatment difference versus placebo ranged from -0.9 to -4.3 days, depending on the dose and the subgroup of patients. The results were consistent across different subgroups, including patients who had failed prior preventive treatments. Additionally, at week 12, 30% of patients in the erenumab group had a 50% or greater reduction from baseline in the mean number of monthly migraine days, compared to 14% in the placebo group. These findings suggest that erenumab is an effective preventive treatment for migraines, with the potential to significantly reduce the number of migraine days per month.","subcutaneous erenumab reduced monthly migraine days and increased the likelihood of achieving a ≥ 50% reduction at all monthly assessment points tested in 2 pivotal trials in episodic migraine (em) and chronic migraine (cm). treatment with both doses of erenumab resulted in greater reductions in monthly migraine days at months 4-6 (treatment difference versus placebo [95% ci], never failed subgroup: -0.9 [-1.5, -0.3] for 70 mg and -1.3 [-1.9, -0.7] for 140 mg; ≥1 prior failed medication categories subgroup: -2.0 [-2.8, -1.2] for 70 mg and -2.5 [-3.4, -1.7] for 140 mg; ≥2 prior failed medication categories subgroup: -1.3 [-2.6, 0.0] for 70 mg and -2.7 [-4.0, -1.4] for 140 mg). results treatment with both doses of erenumab resulted in greater reductions in monthly migraine days (primary endpoint) at month 3 (treatment difference [95% ci], never failed subgroup: -2.2 [-4.1, -0.3] for 70 mg and -0.5 [-2.4, 1.5] for 140 mg; ≥ 1 prior failed medication categories subgroup: -2.5 [-3.8, -1.2], for 70 mg and -3.3 [-4.6, -2.1] for 140 mg; ≥ 2 prior failed medication categories subgroup: -2.7 [-4.2, -1.2], for 70 mg and -4.3 [-5.8, -2.8] for 140 mg). conclusion erenumab reduced migraine disability and impact and improved patients' health-related quality of life, reinforcing its role as a promising new therapy for migraine prevention. at week 12, 36 (30%) patients in the erenumab had a 50% or greater reduction from baseline in the mean number of monthly migraine days, compared with 17 (14%) in the placebo group (odds ratio 2·7 [95% ci 1·4-5·2]; p=0·002). background erenumab was effective and well tolerated in a pivotal clinical trial of chronic migraine. erenumab is a new preventive treatment for migraines. erenumab also significantly reduced the proportion of patients with severe and very severe migraine-related disability and increased the proportion of patients with clinically meaningful improvements in migraine-related impact and health-related quality of life. our real-life data confirm the efficacy and tolerability of erenumab for the prevention of migraine in a difficult-to-treat population of patients with a high prevalence of chronic migraine and medication overuse. compared with placebo, erenumab was efficacious in patients with episodic migraine who previously did not respond to or tolerate between two and four previous migraine preventive treatments. among patients with episodic migraine in whom multiple medication classes had not previously failed, subcutaneous fremanezumab, compared with placebo, resulted in a statistically significant 1.3- to 1.5-day reduction in the mean number of monthly migraine days over a 12-week period. conclusion erenumab showed consistent efficacy in chronic migraine patients who had failed prior preventive treatments and was well tolerated across subgroups. to determine reversion rates from chronic migraine to episodic migraine during long-term erenumab treatment. erenumab is predicted to reduce migraine-related direct and indirect costs, and increase qalys compared to sc. erenumab is a novel cgrp-receptor antibody with preventive efficacy in migraine. these findings suggest that erenumab may not be an exclusively peripheral migraine treatment but has additional central effects. most patients treated with erenumab in clinical practice have chronic migraine (cm). the evaluation compared erenumab to no preventive treatment in episodic and chronic migraine patients that have failed at least one preventive therapy. background we evaluated the effect of erenumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the canonical calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor, on migraine-related disability, impact, and health-related quality of life among patients with episodic migraine. therapeutic benefits are based on estimated changes in monthly migraine days (mmd) from erenumab pivotal clinical trials and a network meta-analysis of migraine studies. |||",Yes
Is screening by optical coherence tomography superior to conventional examinations for the early detection of diabetic macular edema?,No,"Justification: The context suggests that optical coherence tomography (OCT) has been systematically reviewed for its sensitivity and specificity in diagnosing macular edema due to diabetic retinopathy.

Does the treatment of diabetes-related retinal diseases by injection of VEGF inhibitors provide an advantage compared to conventional laser treatment?,Yes,"The treatment of diabetes-related retinal diseases by injection of VEGF inhibitors has been shown to provide an advantage compared to conventional laser treatment. Over a decade of clinical evidence indicates that intravitreal injection of anti-VEGF agents is associated with decreased disease progression and preservation of vision. These agents have become the gold standard treatment for diabetic retinopathy and have shown significant improvement in visual acuity. In addition, intravitreal anti-VEGF treatment with ranibizumab has been found to lead to a significant stabilization or even improvement of diabetic retinopathy. While the primary treatment options remain laser photocoagulation and anti-VEGF intravitreal injections, the latter has been found to be beneficial in cases with neovascular glaucoma, persistent vitreous hemorrhage, and before vitrectomy. However, it is important to note that each intravitreal injection of these agents carries a small risk of endophthalmitis, which can be visually devastating.","the aim of this study was to determine the efficacy of the intravitreal vascular endothelial growth factor (vegf) inhibitor application alone or combined with macular focal/grid lasephotocoagulation compared with laser treatment alone. over a decade of clinical evidence shows intravitreal injection of anti-vegf agents is associated with decreased disease progression and preservation of vision. diabetic maculopathy can be treated with intravitreal injection of vascular endothelial growth factor (vegf) inhibitors. the current standard of care in clinical practice for diabetic retinopathy (dr), anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (vegf) therapy, has shown a significant improvement in visual acuity. intravitreal injections of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor drugs have become the gold standard treatment for diabetic retinopathy (dr). while the development of targeted molecular therapy to inhibit vascular endothelial growth factor (vegf) has revolutionized the treatment and visual prognosis of highly prevalent retinal diseases such as diabetic retinopathy and age-related macular degeneration, each intravitreal injection of these agents carries a small risk of endophthalmitis which can be visually devastating. previous research has implicated vascular endothelial growth factor (vegf) in the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy (dr). in addition to laser photocoagulation therapy, intraocular injections of antivascular endothelial growth factor drugs have contributed to the treatment of these disease conditions. although many studies reviewed the use of anti-vegf for diabetic macular oedema, little has been written about the use of anti-vegf for proliferative diabetic retinopathy (pdr). despite all research efforts, the primary treatment options remain laser photocoagulation and anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (vegf) intravitreal injections, both aggressive and targeting the late stages of the disease. this study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of anti-vegf (ranibizumab) on diabetic macular oedema in previously vitrectomized eyes. the involvement of vegf in pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy is well established, but there is lack of data regarding angiogenin in retinopathy. the goal of this study was to evaluate the potential protective effects of an intravitreally injected vascular endothelial growth factor (vegf) inhibitor (ranibizumab) on retinal cells in an ischemia animal model via immunohistochemistry (if) and quantitative real-time pcr (pcr). in practice, laser therapy remains the standard treatment for diabetic patients with significantly reduced visual acuity due to macular oedema. elevated intraocular levels of angiogenic cytokines such as vascular endothelial growth factor (vegf) have been implicated the development of diabetic retinopathy. off-label use of anti-vegf agents was found to be beneficial in pdr, especially in cases with neovascular glaucoma, persistent vitreous haemorrhage, and before vitrectomy. retinal fixation was studied in 29 patients with diabetic macular oedema before three monthly anti-vegf injections, and 1 and 4 months after the last injection. this study indicates that in addition to the significant improvement in visual acuity and reduction of central retinal thickness in patients with center-involving diabetic macular edema, intravitreal anti-vegf treatment with ranibizumab may also lead to a significant stabilization or even improvement of diabetic retinopathy. the dme treatment included intravitreal vegf inhibitor bevacizumab (avasting) application, with and without laser treatment. the disease therapy with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (vegf) agents gives some positive results, but is associated with retinal ischemia and vasoconstriction. |||",Yes

The intake of milk or cheese was not associated with bladder cancer risk. However, it is important to note that findings from epidemiologic studies of the effect of dairy foods on the risk of bladder cancer have been inconsistent.","inconsistent associations between milk and other dairy product consumption and bladder cancer (bc) have been reported. we aimed to examine the association between the intake of cultured milk and other dairy foods and the incidence of bladder cancer in a prospective, population-based cohort. these findings suggest that a high intake of cultured milk may lower the risk of developing bladder cancer. observational studies have shown that milk consumption is inversely associated with colorectal, bladder, and breast cancer risk, but positively associated with prostate cancer. total dairy intake was not significantly associated with risk of bladder cancer [> or =7.0 servings/d compared with < 3.5 servings/d: multivariate rate ratio (rr) = 0.87; 95% ci: 0.66, 1.15; p for trend = 0.33]. there was no or limited evidence that milk consumption affects the risk of bladder, breast, and prostate cancer. the intake of milk or cheese was not associated with bladder cancer risk. we investigated the potential causal associations of milk consumption with the risk of colorectal, bladder, breast, and prostate cancer using a genetic variant near the lct gene as proxy for milk consumption. there was no overall association of genetically predicted milk consumption with bladder (or 0.99; 95% ci 0.94-1.05; p = 0.836), breast (or 1.01; 95% ci 1.00-1.02; p = 0.113), and prostate cancer (or 1.01; 95% ci 0.99-1.02; p = 0.389), but a positive association with prostate cancer was observed in the finngen consortium (or 1.07; 95% ci 1.01-1.13; p = 0.026). dairy foods and their constituents (lactose and calcium) have been hypothesized to promote ovarian carcinogenesis. milk consumption was strongly correlated with incidence rates of prostate cancer (r = 0.65-0.69; all p < 0.0001) and breast cancer (r = 0.64-0.74; all p < 0.0001) in all the nine time periods examined. our results show that high milk consumption (either skim or whole) did not promote progression of existing prostate tumors when assessed at early stages of tumorigenesis (hyperplasia and neoplasia). previous studies have associated higher milk intake with greater prostate cancer (pca) incidence, but little data are available concerning milk types and the relation between milk intake and risk of fatal pca. although case-control studies have reported conflicting results for dairy foods and lactose, several cohort studies have shown positive associations between skim milk, lactose, and ovarian cancer. our findings strengthen the evidence for a protective role of milk consumption on colorectal cancer risk. whether milk consumption is associated with the risk of prostate, breast, colon, and rectal cancers is unclear and was evaluated in this study. milk may be one of the risk factors in the development of breast cancer from epidemiological investigations. this literature review evaluates the epidemiological and mechanistic evidence linking dairy consumption with breast cancer risk. we assessed consumption of fermented milk, non-fermented milk, cheese, and butter, estimated from semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaires, in relation to prospective risk of breast, prostate, colorectal, smoking-, and obesity-related cancers in 101,235 subjects, including 12,552 cancer cases, in the population-based northern sweden health and disease study. findings from epidemiologic studies of the effect of dairy foods (mainly milk) on the risk of bladder cancer have been inconsistent. |||",No
Do milk or dairy products promote prostate cancer?,Yes,"Justification: The literature suggests a positive association between the consumption of milk and dairy products and an increased risk of developing prostate cancer.

Does brisk walking lower mortality? Is some exercise better than none at all?,Yes,"Brisk walking has been identified as a form of moderate intensity exercise, which is associated with a longer life. Studies have shown that brisk walkers have a survival advantage over slow walkers, irrespective of other lifestyle behaviors, except for smoking. The estimated 10-year survival was higher in brisk walkers who engaged in an unhealthy lifestyle compared to slow walkers who engaged in an otherwise healthy lifestyle. These findings suggest that even a modest increase in physical activity, such as brisk walking, can have a significant impact on health and quality of life. Exercise confers myriad health benefits, including enhanced cardiovascular fitness, improved blood pressure, and decreased prevalence of hypertension and coronary heart disease. Therefore, it can be concluded that brisk walking does lower mortality and that some exercise is better than none at all.","except for smoking, brisk walkers with an otherwise unhealthy lifestyle have a lower mortality risk than slow walkers with an otherwise healthy lifestyle. brisk walking and a greater muscle strength have been associated with a longer life; whether these associations are influenced by other lifestyle behaviours, however, is less well known. estimated 10-year survival was higher in brisk walkers who otherwise engaged in an unhealthy lifestyle compared to slow walkers who engaged in an otherwise healthy lifestyle: 97.1% (95% confidence interval: 96.9-97.3) vs 95.0% (94.6-95.4) in women; 94.8% (94.7-95.0) vs 93.7% (93.3-94.2) in men. instructing individuals to ""walk briskly"" prompts more vigorous activity. brisk walking has been identified as an activity suited to meet american college of sport medicine/centers for disease control and prevention recommendations for moderate intensity exercise (55-69% hr(max), 40-59% vo(2)r). body mass index modified the association between walking pace and survival in men, with the largest survival benefits of brisk walking observed in underweight participants. brisk walkers had a survival advantage over slow walkers, irrespective of the degree of engagement in other lifestyle behaviours, except for smoking. these results suggest that walking at a relatively slow speed up a moderate incline is a potential exercise strategy that may reduce the risk of musculoskeletal injury/pathological disease while providing proper cardiovascular stimulus in obese adults. these findings suggest that brisk walking is of a sufficient intensity to elicit a thr in all but the most highly fit patients with coronary disease. however, it remains unclear whether or not brisk walking is of a sufficient intensity to improve aerobic fitness in this population. brisk walking is a recommended form of exercise for obese individuals. exercise confers myriad health benefits and physical inactivity is a modifiable risk factor for many non-communicable chronic diseases. even a modest increase in physical activity can have a significant impact on health and quality of life. they suggest that walking is an almost ideal activity in light of recent findings about the health benefits of lifelong exercise. a combination of walking, other moderate physical activity, and vigorous physical activity is recommended for achieving good health. thus, physicians and allied health professionals can prescribe brisk walking on a flat surface to their cardiac patients with confidence that this intensity will achieve cardiorespiratory and health benefits. exercise reduces the future cardiometabolic disease risk. the question is not whether exercise is or isn't one of the very best strategies for improving quality of life, cardiovascular (cv) health and longevity-it is. physical activity seems to enhance cardiovascular fitness during the course of the lifecycle, improve blood pressure, and is associated with decreased prevalence of hypertension and coronary heart disease. for sedentary patients, moderate activity is usually more beneficial than a strenuous exercise regimen. |||",Yes
Can arthroscopy reduce pain or improve mobility?,No,"Arthroscopy has been shown to be beneficial in reducing pain and improving mobility in patients with intra-articular pathology, including osteoarthritis and articular cartilage disease. In cases of anterior impingement syndrome, arthroscopic treatment can effectively manage pain and loss of range of motion. In patients with inflammatory arthropathies, arthroscopy with associated debridement and synovectomy can relieve pain, improve function, and delay progression of the disease. Arthroscopy has also emerged as a viable therapeutic option for glenohumeral arthritis when nonoperative measures fail. However, it is important to note that the role of arthroscopy in the treatment of glenohumeral arthritis is still evolving, and it may not be effective in all cases. Additionally, arthroscopy is more effective in combination with additional procedures in younger patients, more active patients, and patients with less severe disease or smaller lesions. In cases where there is no mechanical damage to the knee, nonsurgical, conservative methods may be more appropriate. Overall, arthroscopy can be an effective tool in reducing pain and improving mobility in certain patients with intra-articular pathology.","arthroscopic arthrolysis not only improved pain and the range of motion, but also restored the elbow function and returned patients to their desired level of activity. arthroscopy, which has been used extensively to decrease pain and inflammation and increase the range of motion, has recently been challenged as the treatment of choice. while arthroscopy is not a ""cure"" for osteoarthritis, arthroscopic and related surgery is of significant benefit to many patients with intra-articular pathology including osteoarthritis and articular cartilage disease. does the range of motion increase after arthroscopic treatment of an anterior impingement syndrome? less understood is whether arthroscopic treatment, compared to open surgery, can result in effective management of pain, loss of range of motion, and return athletes to previous levels of activity. in those with inflammatory arthropathies, arthroscopy with associated debridement and synovectomy can relieve pain, improve function, and delay progression of the disease. when nonoperative measures fail in the treatment of glenohumeral arthritis, arthroscopy has emerged as a viable therapeutic option. low-quality evidence showed no statistically significant difference in pain or functional status between patients who received arthroscopic treatment versus usual care (e.g., physical therapy). arthroscopic management of degenerative arthritis is an attractive alternative to osteotomy or total knee arthroplasty if predictable improvement and durable results can be achieved. arthroscopy is a less invasive alternative and can provide a precise diagnosis of early osteoarthritis or cartilage injury. although the role of arthroscopy in the treatment of glenohumeral arthritis is evolving, in certain situations and patients it is thus a viable option and another tool in the armamentarium of the orthopedic surgeon. there are degrees of osteoarthritis severity, and arthroscopy is more effective in combination with additional procedures in younger patients, in more active patients, and in patients with less severe disease, or smaller lesions. can arthroscopic surgery of the ankle joint be routinely performed without joint distraction? how effective arthroscopic debridement with or without meniscectomy is for relieving pain and improving patients' functional outcomes is uncertain. previous studies have suggested hemiarthroplasty might result in less pain, better function, and greater patient satisfaction compared with arthrodesis. since there is limited benefit to be gained from arthroscopy in cases where there is no mechanical damage to the knee, we suggest that nonsurgical, conservative methods be employed in treating the majority of cases of osteoarthritis. patients with knee pain as a result of osteoarthritis or degenerative meniscal injury may seek treatment through arthroscopic surgery. in the athlete and young patient with osteoarthritis, arthroscopy allows recognition and treatment of coexisting pathologies in which procedures such as subacromial decompression and capsular release have proven to be of benefit. when considering arthroscopic surgery for treatment of hip pain, it is important to understand the influence of joint degeneration on the likelihood of success. is there an indication for diagnostic arthroscopy? |||",No
Do health benefits increase with duration and intensity of exercise?,Yes,"The context suggests that a higher duration and intensity of exercise can augment the beneficial effects on cardiovascular health and metabolism. Many exercise-related health benefits exhibit a dose-response relationship, meaning that up to a certain point, more exercise is more beneficial. Increasing exercise duration and intensity beyond current recommendations can impart additional cardiovascular benefits. Different exercise intensities may provide distinct health benefits, independent of energy expenditure. Exercise training with low-volume but high-intensity has been suggested as a time-efficient means to achieve health benefits. Habitual physical activity and regular exercise training improve cardiovascular health and longevity. The requisite beneficial amount of activity is that which engenders improved cardiorespiratory fitness, strength, power, and balance. An abundance of epidemiological research confirms the benefits of physical activity in reducing the risk of various age-related morbidities and all-cause mortality.","however, a higher duration and intensity augments the beneficial effect on cardiovascular health and metabolism. many of the exercise-related health benefits exhibit a dose-response relationship: up to a point, more exercise is more beneficial. for most of the population, increasing exercise duration and intensity beyond current recommendations appears to impart additional cardiovascular benefits; however, recent data has raised the possibility of an inflection point after which additional exercise no longer imparts benefit and may even result in negative cardiovascular outcomes. there is little doubt that regular exercise results in increases in life expectancy and protects against adverse cardiac events in both healthy subjects and patients with cardiovascular disease. long-term benefits of continued exercise include a decreased risk of death from heart disease, enhanced balance and mobility, a decreased risk of diabetes, and an improvement in depressive symptoms. however, recent studies have suggested that different exercise intensities may provide distinct health benefits, independent of energy expenditure (i.e., exercise dose). the capacity for human exercise performance can be enhanced with prolonged exercise training, whether it is endurance- or strength-based. chronic exercise or high levels of physical activity have been shown to be related to improved vaccination responses in older adults, illustrating improved immune function, and conferring potentially significant public health benefit. cohort studies provide a compelling argument that 'more is better' regarding the exercise dose for increasing tee, that increasing tee is protective for health, and that this is mediated through increased cardiorespiratory fitness. a growing body of evidence suggests that exercise training with low-volume but high-intensity may be a time-efficient means to achieve health benefits. robust epidemiological evidence exists that lifelong regular exercise contributes to longevity. exercise training above the public health recommendations provides additional benefits regarding disease protection and longevity. this document summarizes available evidence on the relationship between the exercise volume and risk reductions in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. habitual physical activity and regular exercise training improve cardiovascular health and longevity. objectives: this study determined whether a moderate- or high-dose exercise program increases exercise reinforcement. habitual exercise provides numerous health benefits to the older adult. this study addresses whether the combination of endurance (ed) and resistance training in older men have supplementary health-related benefits in addition to profits attained through endurance training alone. analysis of the literature focusing on key exercise variables (e.g., intensity, type, and volume) suggests that the requisite beneficial amount of activity is that which engenders improved cardiorespiratory fitness, strength, power, and, indirectly, balance. an abundance of epidemiological research confirms the benefits of physical activity in reducing risk of various age-related morbidities and all-cause mortality. available data suggest a positive relationship between higher levels of fitness and higher functional state/improved quality of life, both in healthy individuals and in those experiencing specific ailments commonly seen in an aging population. |||",Yes
