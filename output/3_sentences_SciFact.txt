Genetic deficiency of mast cells leads to decreased weight gain in a mouse model of diet-induced obesity. [SEP] 'Furthermore, in the context of mice on a Western diet, genetically induced deficiency of mast cells, or their pharmacological stabilization, reduces body weight gain and levels of inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and proteases in serum and WAT, in concert with improved glucose homeostasis and energy expenditure.' [597790] 'This study presents evidence that mast cells also contribute to diet-induced obesity and diabetes.' [597790] 'Adoptive transfer experiments of cytokine-deficient mast cells show that these cells, by producing interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), contribute to mouse adipose tissue cysteine protease cathepsin expression, apoptosis and angiogenesis, thereby promoting diet-induced obesity and glucose intolerance.'

Glucose restriction to 0.05% reduces RLS (replicative life span) by 20-40% in S. cerevisiae. [SEP] 'Furthermore, Sir2 has been implicated in mediating the beneficial effects of caloric restriction (CR) on life span, not only in yeast, but also in higher eukaryotes.' [1754001] 'Deleting SIR2 shortens RLS, while increased gene dosage causes extension.'

Glycan adaptation involves insertion-deletion events. [SEP] "The major conclusions are (i) the mutation rate of a wild-type E. coli strain is ~1 × 10(-3) per genome per generation; (ii) mutations in the wild-type strain have the expected mutational bias for G:C > A:T mutations, but the bias changes to A:T > G:C mutations in the absence of MMR; (iii) during replication, A:T > G:C transitions preferentially occur with A templating the lagging strand and T templating the leading strand, whereas G:C > A:T transitions preferentially occur with C templating the lagging strand and G templating the leading strand; (iv) there is a strong bias for transition mutations to occur at 5'ApC3'/3'TpG5' sites (where bases 5'A and 3'T are mutated) and, to a lesser extent, at 5'GpC3'/3'CpG5' sites (where bases 5'G and 3'C are mutated); (v) although the rate of small (≤4 nt) insertions and deletions is high at repeat sequences, these events occur at only 1/10th the genomic rate of base-pair substitutions." [24896957] 'In this report, we analyze spontaneous mutations accumulated over thousands of generations by wild-type Escherichia coli and a derivative defective in mismatch repair (MMR), the primary pathway for correcting replication errors.' [24896957] 'MMR activity is genetically regulated, and bacteria isolated from nature often lack MMR capacity, suggesting that modulation of MMR can be adaptive.' [24896957] 
Glycan adaptation is rarely observed in the B-cell repertoire. [SEP] 'TG2-specific antibodies were of high affinity yet showed little adaptation by somatic mutations.' [1471041] 'Unlike infection-induced peripheral blood plasmablasts, the TG2-specific ASCs had not recently proliferated and were not short-lived ex vivo.'

[19756935] 'We describe a simple and reproducible method for purification of viable human pancreatic beta cells devoid of exocrine acini and ducts.'] [19756935] 'However, elimination of the duct cells by CA19-9 microbeads followed by positive sorting of the PSA-NCAM-positive cells in five consecutive islet preparations resulted in 90 to 98% pure endocrine cells, of which 89 to 97% were beta cells.' [19756935] 
Pyridostatin decreases telomere fragility in BRCA2-deficient cells. [SEP] 'Treatment with the G4-stabilizing compound pyridostatin (PDS) increases telomere fragility in BRCA2-deficient cells, suggesting that G4 formation drives telomere instability.' [16472469] 'Here, we demonstrate that the replication efficiency of guanine-rich (G-rich) telomeric repeats is decreased significantly in cells lacking HR.' [16472469] 'We have previously shown that HR facilitates telomere replication.' [16472469] 
Pyridostatin deregulates G2/M progression. [SEP] 'The signal transducers activate p53 and inactivate cyclin-dependent kinases to inhibit cell cycle progression from G1 to S (the G1/S checkpoint), DNA replication (the intra-S checkpoint), or G2 to mitosis (the G2/M checkpoint).' [38131471] 'Damage to DNA induces several cellular responses that enable the cell either to eliminate or cope with the damage or to activate a programmed cell death process, presumably to eliminate cells with potentially catastrophic mutations.' [38131471] 'These DNA damage response reactions include: (a) removal of DNA damage and restoration of the continuity of the DNA duplex; (b) activation of a DNA damage checkpoint, which arrests cell cycle progression so as to allow for repair and prevention of the transmission of damaged or incompletely replicated chromosomes; (c) transcriptional response, which causes changes in the transcription profile that may be beneficial to the cell; and (d) apoptosis, which eliminates heavily damaged or seriously deregulated cells.' [38131471] 
Pyridostatin encourages proliferation of homologous recombination - defective cells. [SEP] 'Treatment with the G4-stabilizing compound pyridostatin (PDS) increases telomere fragility in BRCA2-deficient cells, suggesting that G4 formation drives telomere instability.' [16472469] 'Remarkably, PDS reduces proliferation of HR-defective cells by inducing DSB accumulation, checkpoint activation, and deregulated G2/M progression and by enhancing the replication defect intrinsic to HR deficiency.' [16472469] 'Stalled replication forks can be stabilized and restarted by homologous recombination (HR), which also repairs DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) arising at collapsed forks.' [16472469] 
Pyridostatin induces checkpoint activation. [SEP] 'In this review the molecular mechanisms of DNA repair and the DNA damage checkpoints in mammalian cells are analyzed.'] [38131471] 'The signal transducers activate p53 and inactivate cyclin-dependent kinases to inhibit cell cycle progression from G1 to S (the G1/S checkpoint), DNA replication (the intra-S checkpoint), or G2 to mitosis (the G2/M checkpoint).' [38131471] 'The DNA damage checkpoints employ damage sensor proteins, such as ATM, ATR, the Rad17-RFC complex, and the 9-1-1 complex, to detect DNA damage and to initiate signal transduction cascades that employ Chk1 and Chk2 Ser/Thr kinases and Cdc25 phosphatases.' [38131471] 
Pyridostatin induces double-strand breaks accumulation. [SEP] ['DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), which are formed by the Spo11 protein, initiate meiotic recombination.' [10874408] 'Comparisons of DSB signals in dmc1, dmc1 rad51, and dmc1 spo11 mutant strains identify Dmc1 as a critical strand-exchange activity genome-wide, and confirm previous conclusions that Spo11-induced lesions initiate all meiotic recombination.'] [10874408] 'Previous DSB-mapping studies have used rad50S or sae2Δ mutants, which are defective in break processing, to accumulate Spo11-linked DSBs, and report large (≥ 50 kb) “DSB-hot” regions that are separated by “DSB-cold” domains of similar size.' [10874408] 
Pyridostatin prevents double-strand breaks accumulation. [SEP] ['DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), which are formed by the Spo11 protein, initiate meiotic recombination.' [10874408] 'We therefore developed a novel method to map genome-wide, single-strand DNA (ssDNA)–associated DSBs that accumulate in processing-capable, repair-defective dmc1Δ and dmc1Δ rad51Δ mutants.' [10874408] 'Comparisons of DSB signals in dmc1, dmc1 rad51, and dmc1 spo11 mutant strains identify Dmc1 as a critical strand-exchange activity genome-wide, and confirm previous conclusions that Spo11-induced lesions initiate all meiotic recombination.'] [10874408]

Pyridostatin stabilizes the G - quadruplex in the telomeric region. [SEP] 'Telomestatin is able to stabilize G-quadruplex structures that are formed from duplex human telomeric DNA as well as from single-stranded DNA.' [26118532] 'Importantly, telomestatin stabilizes these G-quadruplex structures in the absence of monovalent cations, which is a unique characteristic among G-quadruplex-interactive compounds.' [26118532] 'We have demonstrated that telomestatin interacts preferentially with intramolecular versus intermolecular G-quadruplex structures and also has a 70-fold selectivity for intramolecular G-quadruplex structures over duplex DNA.' [26118532] 
R2D2 stops miRNA production by increasing the selectivity of Dcr2 for long dsRNA. [SEP] 'We find that purified Dicer-2 can efficiently cleave pre-miRNA, but that inorganic phosphate and the Dicer-2 partner protein R2D2 inhibit pre-miRNA cleavage.' [5702790] 'We show that Dicer-2 is a dsRNA-stimulated ATPase that hydrolyzes ATP to ADP; ATP hydrolysis is required for Dicer-2 to process long dsRNA, but not pre-miRNA.' [5702790] ['Drosophila Dicer-2 generates small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) from long double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), whereas Dicer-1 produces microRNAs (miRNAs) from pre-miRNA.' [5702790] 
RA activation of DIF2 and NB4 cells induces hallmarks of transcriptionally active promoters. [SEP] 'The accumulation of ALP mRNA was inhibited by both actinomycin D and cycloheximide, indicating that its induction is a complex event and may involve other regulatory proteins.' [32001951] 'These findings demonstrated that the induction of ALP in BC-M1 cells by dexamethasone is mainly due to the increase in the transcription of the ALP gene.'] [32001951] 'Retinoic acid (RA) and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate also substantially reduced the dexamethasone-induced expression of ALP.' [32001951]
