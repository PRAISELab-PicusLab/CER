"Does exercise, a restricted diet, or both together help prevent excessive weight gain during pregnancy?","['True', 'NEI', 'False']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"The evidence from the review suggests that both diet and exercise, as well as diet alone, are effective in minimizing gestational weight gain. Preliminary evidence indicates that a combination of dieting and exercise may be more effective than diet alone in helping women lose weight after childbirth, as it improves maternal cardiorespiratory fitness and preserves fat-free mass. Healthy eating and physical activity strategies have been shown to be effective in controlling gestational weight gain, with healthy eating with calorie and macronutrient goals being particularly effective in limiting excessive gestational weight gain among pregnant overweight and obese women. Behavioral modification through physical activity and dietary counseling has also been shown to have beneficial effects on pregnant women with overweight/obesity. In summary, the evidence suggests that exercise, a restricted diet, or both together can help prevent excessive weight gain during pregnancy."
Does ointment with comfrey help against back pain and knee pain better than a placebo?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"The efficacy of topical comfrey preparations for the treatment of painful muscle and joint complaints has been substantiated through various clinical trials and non-interventional studies. These studies have demonstrated that comfrey formulations are effective in relieving pain and stiffness, and in improving physical functioning. In particular, comfrey root extract has been used for the topical treatment of painful muscle and joint complaints, with its anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties proven in clinical studies. The percutaneous efficacy of an ointment of comfrey extract was confirmed in a double-blind, multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, group comparison study on patients suffering from unilateral acute ankle sprains. Furthermore, repeated-measures analyses of variance yielded significant differences in all of the Western Ontario and MacMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index categories (pain p < .01, stiffness p < .01, daily function p < .01), confirming that the 10% and 20% comfrey-based creams were superior to the reference cream. Comfrey root preparations are used for the external treatment of joint distortions and myalgia, due to its analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties. In conclusion, ointment with comfrey has been shown to help against back pain and knee pain better than a placebo."
"Do other xylitol-containing products (e.g. chewing gums, sweets, mouth rinses) reduce the risk of caries in addition to normal dental care?","['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The context suggests that xylitol, a sugar alcohol, has been widely documented to have dental health benefits, including reducing the risk for dental caries. This is supported by evidence from clinical studies, which have found that xylitol can reduce the occurrence of dental caries in young children, schoolchildren, and mothers, and in children via their mothers. The use of xylitol-containing chewing gums has been shown to reduce the caries risk by up to 59% in the 5 years after habitual gum-chewing ended. Furthermore, xylitol-sorbitol gums have been found to reduce the caries risk by 44%. The context also mentions that xylitol has been widely promoted as an oral healthcare product due to its perceived anticariogenic effect and that it can decrease mutans streptococci levels in plaque and saliva. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that other xylitol-containing products, such as chewing gums, sweets, and mouth rinses, may also reduce the risk of caries in addition to normal dental care."
Can light therapy with light lamps relieve the symptoms of autumn-winter depression?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"The context provided indicates that light therapy, including the use of light lamps, has been shown to be an effective treatment for seasonal and non-seasonal major depression. Specifically, a 1- to 2-week open trial of bright (greater than or equal to 2,000 lux) incandescent light with seasonal (fall/winter) and nonseasonal depressives produced a therapeutic effect on seasonal depression. This effect was measured by three criteria for recovery: final score on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD) less than 10; final HRSD score less than or equal to 50% of pretreatment HRSD score; and no longer meeting DSM-III criteria for major depressive disorder. Additionally, a meta-analysis including 881 participants from 20 randomized controlled trials demonstrated a beneficial effect of light therapy in non-seasonal depression. These findings suggest that light therapy, including the use of light lamps, can be an effective treatment for relieving the symptoms of autumn-winter depression."
Is ozone suitable for the treatment of tooth decay?,"['True', 'False', 'NEI']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"Ozone, in its gaseous form or as ozonated water, has been proposed as a treatment for dental caries for over a decade. Its antimicrobial activity, biocompatibility, and healing properties make it a promising tool for controlling oral infectious microorganisms in dental plaque and cavities. Ozone's antimicrobial effects have been reported in both gaseous and aqueous forms, and it has been suggested as an alternative antiseptic agent in dentistry. In vitro studies have tested the hypothesis that ozone promotes remineralization of dentinal lesions. However, it is important to note that ozone treatment of non-cavitated occlusal lesions for 40 seconds did not significantly reduce the number of viable bacteria in infected dentine beneath the demineralized enamel. Nevertheless, there is growing interest in the use of ozone in oral healthcare, and the National Institute for Clinical Excellence is currently reviewing the evidence for its effectiveness in the management of occlusal and plain surface caries."
Do air ions cause an improvement of allergies?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The context suggests that air ions may contribute to an improvement of allergies, particularly in patients with bronchial asthma. Studies have shown that ionisers, which generate atmospheric ions, can reduce airborne allergens, leading to a diminished allergen exposure and improvement of airway hyperresponsiveness in asthmatic patients. In a double-blind, crossover, placebo-controlled trial, a slight but significant improvement in lung function was demonstrated in nine patients during positive as well as negative ion exposure. However, it is important to note that the patients' subjective votings of the air quality did not show any changes due to ion exposure. Additionally, no change in the histamine threshold of the airways was demonstrated in six patients with bronchial asthma during exposure to ions. Therefore, while air ions may have a beneficial effect on allergies, the extent of this effect may vary among individuals."
"Does the Zisano bracelet strengthen the immune system, increase endurance and performance or reduce fatigue?","['NEI', 'True', 'False']",NEI,NEI,NEI,"The context provided does not explicitly mention the Zisano bracelet or its specific effects on the immune system, endurance, performance, or fatigue. However, it does discuss the role of zinc in various biological functions, including immunity, energy metabolism, and antioxidative processes. Zinc is known to be essential for the functions of the immune system and has been postulated to improve immune responses when supplemented. It also plays a role in exercise performance and physical activity. Therefore, if the Zisano bracelet contains zinc and is able to deliver it effectively, it may have the potential to support the immune system and enhance performance. However, without specific information about the Zisano bracelet's composition and effectiveness, it is not possible to definitively answer the question."
Do diets with primarily or exclusively uncooked foods have health benefits?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The context suggests that diets rich in whole and unrefined foods, such as whole grains, vegetables, fruits, legumes, nuts, and seeds, contain high concentrations of antioxidant phenolics, fibers, and other phytochemicals that may be protective against chronic diseases. These foods are typically consumed in their raw or minimally processed state, indicating that diets primarily or exclusively composed of uncooked foods can have health benefits. The context also mentions that a diet abundant in phytochemically-rich foods beneficially affected lipoproteins, decreased the need for oxidative defense mechanisms, and improved colon function. This further supports the claim that diets with primarily or exclusively uncooked foods have health benefits."
Does taking vitamin C prevent motion sickness?,"['NEI', 'False', 'True']",NEI,NEI,NEI,"The provided context does not contain information regarding the effect of vitamin C on motion sickness. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether taking vitamin C prevents motion sickness based solely on the given information. Further research is needed to establish a connection between vitamin C and motion sickness prevention."
"Can taking dietary supplements with omega-3 fatty acids prevent further heart attacks or strokes if one has already had a heart attack?  In this case, does it lower the risk of dying prematurely??","['True', 'NEI', 'False']",No,Yes,Yes,"Several epidemiological and clinical studies have shown that dietary supplementation of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (omega-3 PUFAs) can reduce the risk of sudden death following a myocardial infarction. Current evidence suggests that individuals with coronary artery disease may reduce their risk of sudden cardiac death by increasing their intake of long-chain omega-3 fatty acids by approximately 1 g per day. The cardioprotective effects of omega-3 fatty acids have been documented in epidemiologic and randomized controlled trials, and they appear to be beneficial in secondary prevention of cardiovascular events. The mechanisms through which omega-3 fatty acids might confer cardiac benefits over and above the standard secondary prevention strategies include reducing heart rate, a major risk factor for sudden death, and increasing vagal activity. However, the detailed mechanisms remain to be elucidated. It is important to note that while omega-3 fatty acids may have cardioprotective effects, they should not be used as a substitute for standard medical treatment and lifestyle modifications."
"Can taking Ribose help with heart conditions such as heart failure, narrowing of the coronary arteries (coronary artery disease), or heart attack?","['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The context suggests that ribose supplementation has been shown to improve ischemic threshold and enhance diastolic function in congestive heart failure. Ribose has been used successfully in the treatment of ischemic heart disease and has been shown to replenish low myocardial energy levels, improving cardiac dysfunction following ischemia. In animal models, ribose has been shown to improve cardiac energy metabolism and function following ischemia. In normal hearts, ribose pretreatment significantly elevated the heart's energy stores and delayed the onset of irreversible ischemic injury. In patients with chronic coronary artery disease and congestive heart failure, oral ribose supplementation has been shown to improve cardiac hemodynamics and quality of life. Therefore, it can be inferred that taking ribose may help with heart conditions such as heart failure, narrowing of the coronary arteries, and heart attack."
Is Intermittent Fasting suitable for reducing excess weight as well as a conventional low calorie diet?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"Intermittent fasting (IF) has been proposed as a potential nutritional approach against obesity and metabolic diseases. It has emerged as an unconventional method to reduce body weight and improve metabolic health beyond simple calorie restriction. IF, characterized by 24-hour cycles alternating ad libitum feeding and fasting, has been shown to provide health benefits equivalent to prolonged fasting or caloric restriction. Recent studies have examined the effect of two IF approaches, alternate day fasting (ADF) and time-restricted eating (TRE), on weight loss and cardiometabolic risk factors. Although IF does not improve weight loss compared to continuous energy restriction (CER), it is a dietary intervention often used as an alternative to caloric restriction and has gained popularity due to its potential long-term health benefits. Fasting has been shown to decrease body weight, lean body, and fat content in both trained and untrained individuals. However, it is important to note that the long-term effects of chronic food restriction in humans are not yet clear, and the optimal diets for IF are unknown. Additionally, IF is linked to hunger, which can be a limiting factor for maintaining food restriction. Nonetheless, current data suggest that IF may be beneficial for overall health and wellbeing, and it may be an option for achieving weight loss and maintenance."
Is there an increased risk of long-term effects on the unborn child with chemotherapy starting in the 2nd trimester of pregnancy?,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",Yes,NEI,NEI,"Justification: The provided context indicates that chemotherapy administered during the first trimester of pregnancy results in increased congenital malformations. However, the risk of fetal malformations when chemotherapy is administered during the second and third trimesters is probably not greater than the background rate. The context also mentions that it is still unclear whether late adverse effects arise if a child is exposed to chemotherapy in utero. Therefore, there is not enough information to definitively state whether there is an increased risk of long-term effects on the unborn child with chemotherapy starting in the 2nd trimester of pregnancy."
,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",No,Yes,Yes,"The therapeutic value of coenzyme Q10 in Parkinson's disease is still being tested, and the preliminary results are promising. Coenzyme Q10 therapy with 1200 mg/d for 16 months was well tolerated by patients with Parkinson's disease. A number of preclinical studies in both in vitro and in vivo models of Parkinson's disease have demonstrated that coenzyme Q10 can protect the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system. Coenzyme Q10 (coq10), an antioxidant that supports mitochondrial function, has been shown in preclinical Parkinson disease (pd) models to reduce the loss of dopamine neurons. A recent study has shown that treatment of human patients with the antioxidant coenzyme Q(10) reduced the worsening of symptoms associated with pd. Coenzyme Q10 appears to be a safe supplement with minimal side effects and low drug interaction potential."
Does treatment with focused high-intensity ultrasound (HIFU) reduce abdominal girth?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) has been found to be an effective treatment for reducing localized adiposities in the abdominal region. HIFU treatment has been shown to effectively reduce abdominal fat in a porcine model, accurately targeting the subcutaneous fat layer and reducing it effectively as measured by ultrasound. HIFU is also an effective and safe modality for reducing waist circumference in nonobese individuals with focal fat accumulation. The use of non-invasive devices for fat reduction involving HIFU has been gaining attention, and a thermal HIFU device for abdominal body shaping has been evaluated for its efficacy and safety. HIFU treatment at different energy levels and multiple tissue depths was well tolerated and effective in reducing waist circumference. HIFU has also been proven effective in body sculpting when used noninvasively to reduce subcutaneous fat and improve body contour. Therefore, it can be concluded that treatment with focused high-intensity ultrasound (HIFU) reduces abdominal girth."
Can capsules or tablets with lactase improve the symptoms of lactose intolerance and make dairy products more tolerable?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"The administration of lactase supplements, such as capsules or tablets, has been shown to improve lactose digestion in individuals with impaired or absent intestinal lactase activity. This is supported by a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, 5-arm crossover study, which demonstrated that different lactase preparations and freeze-dried yogurt culture can affect gastrointestinal lactose digestion and reduce symptoms of lactose intolerance. Furthermore, microbial-derived beta-galactosidase enzyme preparations have been shown to improve in vivo lactose digestion and tolerance through enhanced gastrointestinal digestion of lactose. Therefore, it can be concluded that capsules or tablets with lactase can improve the symptoms of lactose intolerance and make dairy products more tolerable."
Do fish oil capsules promote prostate cancer?,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",Yes,No,No,"The context suggests that fish and fish oil supplements, which are rich in n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), may not promote prostate cancer. In fact, epidemiological studies indicate that frequent consumption of fatty fish and marine fatty acids appears to reduce the risk of prostate cancer. This association is further modified by genetic variation in the COX-2 gene. Interventional studies using fish oil supplements in patients with prostate cancer showed no impact on prostate-specific antigen levels, but two studies showed a decrease in inflammatory or other cancer markers. Cohort studies assessing the risk of prostate cancer mortality suggested an association between higher intake of fish and decreased risk of prostate cancer-related death. In a double-blind placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial, men diagnosed with prostate cancer who consumed fish ≥5 times/week had a 48% lower risk of prostate cancer death than those consuming fish less than once weekly. Therefore, the claim that fish oil capsules promote prostate cancer is not supported by the provided context."
Do products from the noni fruit promote health?,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The article provides evidence that products derived from noni fruit (Morinda citrifolia) have been used in traditional medicine for thousands of years, and are now gaining popularity as dietary supplements. Clinical studies have revealed that noni juice consumption improves quality of life scores related to physical functioning and energy levels. The fruit is also used to combat fatigue, improve endurance, and increase overall physical performance. The knowledge on the chemical composition of noni fruit has considerably increased over recent years, and a large number of beneficial effects have been claimed for noni. Based on a toxicological assessment, noni juice was considered safe. Therefore, it can be concluded that products from the noni fruit promote health."
Does tomato extract reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"Epidemiological evidence suggests that tomato-based products, including tomato extract, could reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases. The antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, and hypotensive effects of tomato consumption are associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular disease. Intervention trials have shown that consuming tomato products and lycopene, a carotenoid found in tomatoes, have positive effects on blood lipids, blood pressure, and endothelial function. These findings support the view that increasing the intake of tomato-based products has beneficial effects on cardiovascular health."
Can zinc mitigate the progression of Covid-19?,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",No,NEI,NEI,"The context suggests that there is a potential link between zinc and the severity of Covid-19. Zinc is a trace element with immunoregulatory and antiviral properties, and it has been observed that Covid-19 patients with zinc deficiency have significantly lower zinc levels compared to healthy controls. In vitro evidence has suggested that zinc sulphate may be efficacious against Covid-19, and clinical trials are ongoing to evaluate the use of zinc alone or in addition to other drugs in the prophylaxis/treatment of Covid-19. However, direct evidence to determine if zinc is effective for either prevention or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 is still pending, and more randomized studies are needed to evaluate the value of adding zinc to other therapies for Covid-19. Therefore, it is not possible to definitively state that zinc can mitigate the progression of Covid-19 based on the current evidence."
Can regular intake of cranberry juice or cranberry extract prevent recurrent cystitis in women?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"The evidence from two randomized controlled trials involving a total of about 300 young women suggests that daily use of cranberry juice or tablets reduced the relapse rate for acute cystitis. The results indicate that treating 100 women for one year prevented at least 1 urinary tract infection in 15 to 33 women. Additionally, there is evidence from two good quality RCTs that cranberry juice may decrease the number of symptomatic UTIs over a 12-month period in women. The studies suggest that cranberry products, especially cranberry juice, may be effective in preventing UTI recurrence in generally healthy women. However, larger high-quality studies are needed to confirm these findings."
Does prickly pear help with long-term weight loss?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The study demonstrates that prickly pear extract supplementation ameliorates diet-induced obesity and associated metabolic complications. The results indicate that prickly pear pectin intake decreases plasma LDL concentrations by increasing hepatic apolipoprotein B/E receptor expression, which leads to lower plasma LDL concentrations. Furthermore, waist circumference was significantly reduced in the pear group after 12 weeks of daily fresh pear consumption. The potential benefits of PGX fiber in controlling frequency of eating and in weight loss have also been demonstrated. These findings suggest that prickly pear may help with long-term weight loss."
Can green tea affect the likelihood of dying early and reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"The consumption of green tea has been associated with a decrease in cardiovascular mortality, as evidenced by epidemiological studies. The health benefits of green tea are attributed to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, which may reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases such as coronary heart disease (CHD) and lower plasma levels of cholesterol and triglyceride. Green tea contains polyphenolic catechins, which act as antioxidants and decrease the risk for cardiovascular diseases. Furthermore, green tea consumption has been inversely associated with the development and progression of cardiovascular diseases and risk factors. Therefore, green tea may prove beneficial as a dietary element in lifestyle interventions aiming to lower cardiovascular disease risk in both older and younger populations."
Do generic drugs work as well as original drugs?,"['True', 'False', 'NEI']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"The context provided indicates that generic drugs are considered therapeutically equivalent to their original counterparts, as they have the same active pharmaceutical ingredients, dosage forms, strength, quality, indications, effects, directions, and dosage. The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) also indicates that an approved generic drug product can serve as a substitute for the innovative drug product. Studies have shown that generic drugs are at least similar, and in some cases superior, to their branded counterparts regarding mortality and major cardiovascular events. Additionally, the use of generic drugs, which are bioequivalent to brand-name drugs, can help contain prescription drug spending. Therefore, it can be concluded that generic drugs work as well as original drugs."
Does the drug remdesivir prevent COVID-19 deaths?,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",No,No,No,"The context suggests that remdesivir may reduce mortality in hospitalized adults with severe COVID-19 by a small amount, with an absolute risk difference range of -4% to 1%. However, it does not provide evidence that remdesivir prevents COVID-19 deaths entirely. The context also mentions that very recent data from the WHO showed little if any COVID-19 protective effect of remdesivir. Therefore, it is not accurate to claim that remdesivir prevents COVID-19 deaths."
Do preparations with unsaponifiable components of avocado and soybean oils (ASU) help against limitations and pain in osteoarthritis of the knee joint?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"The context suggests that preparations with unsaponifiable components of avocado and soybean oils (ASU) have been shown to have beneficial effects in the treatment of osteoarthritis (OA). Studies have evaluated the effects of ASU on pain relief and functional ability in patients with knee OA, and have found that ASU can reduce OA pain and improve joint function. ASU has also been reported to have a chondroprotective effect, reducing cartilage catabolism and chondrocytic synthesis of inflammatory mediators associated with OA. Additionally, a herbal combination containing ASU has been found to be clinically effective in decreasing pain, morning stiffness, and limited motion in patients with knee OA."
"Does inhaling hive air have health benefits for asthma, allergies or other conditions?","['NEI', 'True', 'False']",NEI,No,No,"The provided context does not mention any studies or evidence regarding the health benefits of inhaling hive air for asthma, allergies, or other conditions. Instead, it discusses the use of exhaled h2o2, hydrogen sulfide (h2s), high-altitude treatment, corticosteroid aerosols, and aeroallergen immunotherapy in the treatment of asthma. It also mentions the role of respiratory infections, atopy, and innate immune responses in the development and exacerbation of asthma. Therefore, based on the given context, it cannot be concluded that inhaling hive air has health benefits for asthma, allergies, or other conditions."
Does magnesium help with period pain?,"['NEI', 'False', 'True']",NEI,NEI,NEI,"The provided context discusses the use of magnesium for various conditions, including migraines, acute myocardial infarction, and as an adjunct to general anesthesia. However, it does not provide information on the use of magnesium specifically for period pain. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether magnesium is helpful for period pain based on the given context. Further research is needed to establish the efficacy of magnesium for period pain."
Does sitting for long periods despite compensatory exercise increasingly lead to type 2 diabetes?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"Justification: The evidence suggests that prolonged uninterrupted sitting is adversely related to cardiometabolic risk markers and postprandial hyperglycemia, relative to sitting interrupted by regular brief activity breaks. This indicates that even with compensatory exercise, prolonged sitting can increase the risk of type 2 diabetes. The data from randomized cross-over trials further support this, showing that interrupting prolonged sitting with brief bouts of light-intensity activity can reduce blood pressure and plasma noradrenaline in type 2 diabetes. The metabolic abnormalities associated with a sedentary lifestyle are also better predictors of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease than obesity alone."
Do statins help older people suffering from cardiovascular disease to live longer? Do they reduce the risk of heart attack and stroke?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"The available evidence indicates that statins are effective in reducing the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and total myocardial infarction in older adults. In elderly subjects at high cardiovascular risk without established cardiovascular disease, statins significantly reduce the incidence of myocardial infarction and stroke. Furthermore, statins have been shown to be beneficial in both primary and secondary prevention settings. In older men and women with coronary artery disease and hypercholesterolemia, statins reduce the risk of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, coronary events, coronary revascularization, stroke, intermittent claudication, and congestive heart failure. Despite the potential risks of statins in older adults, their benefits in reducing cardiovascular events and mortality have been demonstrated. Therefore, it can be concluded that statins help older people suffering from cardiovascular disease to live longer and reduce the risk of heart attack and stroke."
Can glacier milk powder prevent hangover or relieve hangover symptoms?,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",NEI,NEI,NEI,"The provided context does not contain information regarding the effects of glacier milk powder on hangover or its symptoms. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether glacier milk powder can prevent or alleviate hangover symptoms based solely on the given information. Further research is required to establish a definitive answer."
"Does bark extract from maritime pine (also: ""pine bark extract"") improve the symptoms of osteoarthritis?","['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The standardized maritime pine bark extract (Pycnogenol®) has been shown to alleviate symptoms in patients with moderate forms of knee osteoarthritis. The inhibition of cartilage-destructing proteases and pain-producing cyclo-oxygenases provides the basis for relief from pain, improvement of stiffness, enhanced mobility, and well-being. Clinical studies have demonstrated that supplementation with the pine bark extract reduces gastric complications and hospital admissions of osteoarthritis patients. The extract exerts antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, and chondroprotective effects in vitro and in vivo."
Does aromatherapy have other positive effects for dementia patients???,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"Aromatherapy has been found to have potential positive effects beyond reducing behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia. Studies suggest that it may improve cognitive function, particularly in patients with Alzheimer's disease. Additionally, aromatherapy has been reported to be beneficial in alleviating agitated behaviors in Chinese patients with dementia. Furthermore, it has been shown to reduce psychological distress and enhance symptom control in cancer patients, indicating its potential for improving overall well-being. However, more research is needed to fully establish the evidence for effective and safe practice of aromatherapy in healthcare institutions."
Does dimenhydrinate relieve travel nausea as well as the proven drug scopolamine???,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",NEI,No,No,"The context indicates that transdermal scopolamine provided protection against motion sickness at a significance level of p = 0.0001, while oral dimenhydrinate did so at a level of p = 0.05. This suggests that scopolamine is more effective than dimenhydrinate in preventing motion sickness. Additionally, studies have been conducted to evaluate the efficacy of scopolamine in preventing motion sickness at sea, while the quantitative effect of dimenhydrinate in the prophylaxis of postoperative nausea and vomiting has not been evaluated systematically. Therefore, it can be concluded that dimenhydrinate does not relieve travel nausea as well as the proven drug scopolamine."
Does artichoke preparation help with gastrointestinal problems?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The scientific literature suggests that artichoke and artichoke products can be beneficial for gastrointestinal problems. A trial has shown a positive effect on symptoms in constipated patients after intake of probiotic-enriched artichokes, with satisfactory relief of symptoms being significantly higher during the probiotic-enriched artichoke period. The study also evaluated the effects of probiotic-enriched artichokes on treatment preference, symptom profile, and short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) production in constipated subjects when compared with ordinary artichokes. Additionally, the supplementation of artichoke and artichoke products has been found to significantly reduce fasting blood sugar (FBS) concentrations in humans. Bristol chart cluster scores were significantly higher and GSRS constipation was significantly lower in the probiotic group compared with the baseline. These findings suggest that artichoke preparation can be helpful in managing gastrointestinal problems."
Can extracorporeal shock wave therapy relieve heel pain if the cause is tendonitis or a heel spur?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"Extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) has been shown to be effective in relieving chronic heel pain, including cases caused by tendonitis and heel spurs. ESWT is a conservative treatment option that has been extensively studied for the management of plantar fasciitis, a common cause of heel pain. The therapy has been found to have success rates between 50% and 65% in the treatment of recalcitrant plantar fasciitis. Additionally, ESWT has been shown to be effective in the treatment of chronic noninsertional achilles tendinopathy, another cause of heel pain. The therapy offers a nonsurgical option in addition to other conservative treatments such as stretching exercises, heel cups, NSAIDs, and corticosteroid injections. However, it should be noted that the effectiveness of ESWT in the treatment of plantar fasciitis is controversial, and more research is needed to determine the optimal treatment protocol."
Can ingredients in deodorants like aluminum salts cause breast cancer?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,", there is evidence to suggest that aluminum salts in deodorants could potentially contribute to breast cancer.

     Justification: The use of aluminum-based antiperspirant salts has been linked to the etiology of gross breast cyst formation, and aluminum has been found at elevated levels in human breast cyst fluid. Aluminum is known to have a genotoxic profile, capable of causing both DNA alterations and epigenetic effects, which could potentially play a role in the development of breast cancer. Furthermore, experimental evidence suggests that the tissue concentrations of aluminum measured in the human breast have the potential to adversely influence breast epithelial cells, including the generation of genomic instability, induction of anchorage-independent proliferation, and interference in estrogen action. While the use of aluminum-containing deodorant was not found to adversely affect axillary skin reaction during radiation therapy for breast cancer, the long-term effects of widespread and increasing use of aluminum-based antiperspirant salts remain unknown. Therefore, reduction in exposure to aluminum-based antiperspirant salts could offer a strategy for prevention, and regulatory review is now justified."
Does pine wood improve sleep?,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",NEI,NEI,NEI,"The context provided does not contain specific information regarding the direct impact of pine wood on sleep improvement. While it mentions the long-lasting odor of certain pine species that has been reported to relieve stress in humans, it does not establish a direct link between pine wood and improved sleep. Therefore, based on the given context, it is not possible to definitively state that pine wood improves sleep. More specific research would be needed to confirm this claim."
"Is the risk for the brain inflammation SSPE as a consequence of measles disease greater than long assumed? That is, out of every 100,000 people infected with measles, does more than one person develop SSPE (subacute sclerosing panencephalitis) later in life?","['True', 'NEI', 'False']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"Justification: The context suggests that Subacute Sclerosing Panencephalitis (SSPE) is a rare, chronic, and progressive encephalitis caused by a persistent infection of the measles virus. The risk of chronic brain infection with the mutant measles virus is influenced by several factors. However, the context does not provide specific data on the incidence of SSPE in relation to the number of measles infections. Nevertheless, the statement that SSPE is a rare disease implies that the risk of developing SSPE after a measles infection is less than one in 100,000 cases. Therefore, the claim that more than one person develops SSPE out of every 100,000 people infected with measles is plausible, suggesting that the risk for SSPE as a consequence of measles disease may be greater than long assumed."
Are animal-assisted therapies effective for mental illness?,"['True', 'False', 'NEI']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"Animal-assisted therapies have been shown to be effective in the treatment of various mental illnesses. Studies have reported statistically significant reductions in anxiety levels for hospitalized psychiatric patients with psychotic disorders, mood disorders, and other disorders after a session of animal-assisted therapy. Animal-assisted therapy has also been found to be beneficial in the treatment of autism spectrum disorders, depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Furthermore, the use of animal-assisted interventions in therapeutic programs is a growing phenomenon, and research has demonstrated that the interaction between patients, animals, and therapists can improve communication, elevate self-confidence, reduce symptoms of diseases, and improve the quality of life."
Is quarantining persons who have had contact with infected persons or who enter from high-risk areas an effective measure to reduce the number of COVID-19 infections and deaths?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"Quarantining individuals who have had contact with infected persons or who enter from high-risk areas is an effective measure to reduce the number of COVID-19 infections and deaths. This is supported by the implementation of traditional public health measures, such as isolation and quarantine, which have been deemed critical steps in stopping the spread of the coronavirus. Contact tracing and quarantine are common measures used in the management of infectious disease outbreaks, and their rigorous implementation remains the most effective tool to control the outbreak, as there is no effective therapy or vaccine yet. Furthermore, recent modeling work shows that these interventions, including quarantine, isolation, and contact tracing, can decrease the spread of the epidemic."
Does taking probiotics facilitate weight loss to any significant degree?,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",No,NEI,NEI,"The available evidence suggests that the impact of probiotics on weight loss is not definitive. While some studies indicate that probiotics may contribute to a reduction in body weight, others report limited or no significant effect. The role of probiotics in altering gut microbiota and gut hormones associated with appetite regulation is also under investigation. Furthermore, the effectiveness and safety of probiotics for the treatment of obesity have been reported for only a few strains. Therefore, it is not possible to definitively conclude that taking probiotics facilitates weight loss to any significant degree."

Does taking a mushroom called reishi benefit cancer?,"['True', 'False', 'NEI']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The consumption of Reishi mushroom (Ganoderma lucidum) has been reported to have potential benefits in cancer prevention and treatment. This mushroom has been used as an herbal medicine for tumor treatment and immune system activation in some cultures. Studies have shown that Reishi extracts have an impact on colon luminal health by modulating secondary bile acids, microflora, mucins, and propionate that are related to colon cancer. Furthermore, Reishi mushroom contains bioactive components such as polysaccharides, proteoglycans, and steroids, which have been isolated and tested for their anti-cancer effects. These data suggest that the inhibition of growth in tumor cells by ""mycochemicals"" in Reishi mushrooms may result from the induction of apoptosis. Therefore, taking Reishi mushroom may benefit cancer prevention and treatment."
"Can vitamin D supplements prevent colds, flu, colds, and other viral respiratory illnesses when there is no or only a mild deficiency of vitamin D?","['False', 'True', 'NEI']",No,No,No,"The evidence suggests that vitamin D supplementation may provide significant benefit in preventing respiratory viral infections, particularly in individuals with deficient levels of vitamin D. However, the data does not support the routine use of high-dose vitamin D supplementation in children for the prevention of viral upper respiratory tract infections when there is no or only a mild deficiency of vitamin D. Furthermore, the mechanisms by which vitamin D affects viral pattern recognition receptor (PRR)-driven cytokine production are not well understood. Therefore, it is not recommended to use vitamin D supplements for the prevention of colds, flu, colds, and other viral respiratory illnesses when there is no or only a mild deficiency of vitamin D."

Does wearing sunglasses in childhood and adolescence protect against macular degeneration in old age???,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The context suggests that cumulative light exposure is significantly associated with ageing and the progression of age-related macular degeneration. Furthermore, it is indicated that macular pigment, with its antioxidant and light-screening properties, is thought to be protective against AMD. Given that sunglasses can reduce light exposure, it can be inferred that wearing sunglasses in childhood and adolescence may protect against macular degeneration in old age. This is because the protective effect of sunglasses in reducing light exposure during these early life stages could potentially mitigate the cumulative light exposure that contributes to the development of AMD in later life."
"Does an extract from the root of the Cape geranium (Pelargonium sidoides, Umckaloabo) work against bronchitis?","['True', 'NEI', 'False']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"The extract from the root of Pelargonium sidoides, also known as Umckaloabo, has been shown to be effective in treating respiratory tract infections, including bronchitis. The root extract, known as EPS 7630, has been widely evaluated for its use in treating upper respiratory tract infections and is currently used for this purpose.

Additionally, the extract has been approved for the treatment of acute bronchitis and is marketed as an immunostimulant."
Does pelvic floor training help women with stress-related urinary incontinence?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"Pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) has been shown to be an effective treatment for stress urinary incontinence (SUI) in women. PFMT is the most commonly used physical therapy treatment for SUI and is recommended as first-line therapy for female patients with SUI. The aim of PFMT is to improve the strength, endurance, and coordination of the pelvic floor muscles, which can help to prevent urine leakage during physical activities that increase intra-abdominal pressure. PFMT has been shown to improve the quality of life (QOL) in women with SUI, and feedback or biofeedback may provide additional benefit. The mechanism of action of PFMT for SUI is not fully understood, but it is thought to involve improvements in the function of the pelvic floor muscles and the urethral sphincter. PFMT is currently considered as the first line conservative management for women with SUI, and it is recommended as a first option of treatment for women with symptoms of SUI, mixed urinary incontinence (MUI), and for some with symptoms of urge urinary incontinence (UUI)."
"Does the ""Rolfing"" treatment cause an improvement of body malpositions as well as certain pains?","['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The results indicate that the ""Rolfing"" treatment, a type of manipulative therapy, has been shown to improve performance in patients with mild cerebral palsy. This improvement is attributed to the patients' neurological capacity to utilize increased tissue mobility, thereby avoiding contractures. The technique involves applying pressure to areas where muscle tendons adhere to each other, promoting normal sliding movement. Although limited clinical trials have been conducted specifically on Rolfing, related research on deep tissue massage and myofascial release supports its potential benefits. The review of historical considerations and the description of the Rolfing process further suggest its compatibility with nursing principles. Therefore, it can be inferred that Rolfing treatment may contribute to the improvement of body malpositions and certain pains, although more specific studies are needed to confirm these effects."
Is the sweetener aspartame harmful to health?,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",No,NEI,NEI,"The safety of aspartame, an artificial sweetener, remains a topic of debate. While some studies suggest a potential link between aspartame intake and adverse neural effects, as well as behavioral and cognitive problems, other research indicates that consumption of aspartame by normal humans is safe and not associated with serious adverse health effects. The present scientific data on the potential toxicity of aspartame and its link with the risk of carcinogenesis, specifically colorectal cancer, are inconclusive. Therefore, it is not possible to definitively state whether aspartame is harmful to health based on the available information."
Does homeopathy work better than a placebo?,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",No,NEI,NEI,"The claim that homeopathy works better than a placebo is not definitively supported by the provided context. While some studies suggest that homeopathy may have greater efficacy than placebo in certain conditions, such as major depressive disorder (MDD) and premenstrual syndrome/dysphoric disorder, other studies have found no difference between homeopathy and placebo in MDD and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Additionally, an international multicenter study found that homeopathy was not superior to placebo in reducing 24-hour morphine consumption after knee ligament reconstruction. Therefore, the evidence is mixed and further research is needed to determine the effectiveness of homeopathy compared to placebo."

The study found that iota-carrageenan nasal spray reduced the symptoms of common cold and the viral load in nasal lavages in patients with early symptoms of common cold. However, the context does not provide information on the efficacy of carrageenan-containing nasal spray in preventing infection with coronavirus or alleviating a COVID-19 disease that has already broken out. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer based on the given context."
Do creams with sterol compounds improve the appearance of cellulite skin?,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",NEI,No,No,"The provided context suggests that while topical creams containing various active substances, including sterol compounds, are often used to treat skin disorders and improve skin health, there is no specific evidence to support the claim that creams with sterol compounds improve the appearance of cellulite skin. The mentioned studies focus on the benefits of creams and lotions containing skin lipids for managing dry skin, improving skin barrier function, and stimulating the functioning of the skin in aging populations or people with dry skin. However, none of the studies directly address the efficacy of sterol compounds in improving the appearance of cellulite skin. Therefore, based on the given context, it is not possible to conclude that creams with sterol compounds improve the appearance of cellulite skin."
Do vitamin E supplements increase the likelihood of early death?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"The evidence from multiple meta-analyses and clinical trials suggests that high-dose vitamin E supplementation (> or =400 IU/d) may increase the risk of all-cause mortality. A dose-response analysis showed a statistically significant relationship between vitamin E dosage and all-cause mortality, with increased risk for dosages greater than 150 IU/d. Nine of 11 trials testing high-dose vitamin E showed increased risk for all-cause mortality in comparisons of vitamin E versus control. A meta-analysis of 19 trials suggested a small increase in the risk of all-cause mortality with high-dose vitamin E supplementation. Therefore, it can be concluded that high-dose vitamin E supplements may increase the likelihood of early death."
Does high air pollution increase the risk for the unborn to develop autism later in life?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The evidence suggests that prenatal and perinatal exposures to air pollutants may adversely affect birth outcomes and contribute to the prevalence of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Studies from the United States indicate that exposure to air pollution in early life is associated with ASD in children, and recent studies have reported associations between perinatal exposure to air pollutants and ASD. Exposure to traffic-related air pollution, nitrogen dioxide, PM2.5, and PM10 during pregnancy and during the first year of life was associated with autism. Furthermore, children with autism were more likely to live at residences that had the highest quartile of exposure to traffic-related air pollution during gestation and during the first year of life compared with control children. These findings suggest that high air pollution may increase the risk for the unborn to develop autism later in life."
Do agents containing uridine and/or cytidine improve the symptoms of polyneuropathy?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The context suggests that agents containing uridine and/or cytidine, specifically in the form of nucleotides (uridine triphosphate trisodium [utp] and cytidine monophosphate disodium [cmp]), have been shown to be safe and effective in the treatment of neuralgias arising from neural compression associated with degenerative orthopedic alterations and trauma. The pyrimidine nucleoside, uridine, has been proposed as a potential supplement in the treatment of psychosis and epilepsy. The context also mentions that chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy, an autoimmune peripheral neuropathy, would be expected to benefit from corticosteroids. While the context does not specifically mention polyneuropathy, it does suggest that agents containing uridine and/or cytidine have been shown to be effective in treating neuralgias and other neurological conditions. Therefore, it can be inferred that these agents may also improve the symptoms of polyneuropathy."
Can red mold rice products lower blood cholesterol levels?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"Red yeast rice, a product derived from the fermentation of rice with a type of yeast called Monascus purpureus, has been shown to have cholesterol-lowering properties. The active ingredient in red yeast rice that blocks cholesterol production is monacolin K. Several studies have found red yeast rice to be moderately effective at improving the lipid profile, particularly for lowering low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels. It has been shown to decrease LDL cholesterol levels without increasing creatine phosphokinase (CPK) or pain levels, making it a potential treatment option for dyslipidemic patients who cannot tolerate statin therapy. However, it is important to note that the variability in monacolin K content in red yeast rice preparations makes predicting or understanding dose-related efficacy and side-effect risks practically impossible."
Does platelet-rich plasma therapy (autologous blood therapy) reduce pain in osteoarthritis of the hip joint???,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",No,Yes,Yes,", but not superior to hyaluronic acid.

     Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) therapy has been shown to provide some symptomatic relief in early osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee. However, the evidence for its efficacy in hip OA is limited. Intra-articular injections of PRP and hyaluronic acid (HA) are both efficacious medical treatments for OA, but no comparative study on long-term efficacy in hip OA exists. In patients with mild/moderate hip OA, PRP may provide pain relief and functional improvement for up to six months. However, intra-articular injections of PRP are not superior to HA in patients with symptomatic hip OA at 12-month follow-up. Therefore, while PRP therapy may reduce pain in hip OA, it is not superior to HA in terms of long-term efficacy."
Can binaural beats relieve stress or anxiety before surgery and medical treatments?,"['True', 'False', 'NEI']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The evidence suggests that binaural beats can have a positive impact on reducing anxiety levels and promoting relaxation. A meta-analysis has found that binaural-beat exposure can affect cognition and reduce anxiety levels, with the direction and magnitude of the effect depending on the frequency used, time under exposure, and the moment in which the exposure takes place. Additionally, several studies have reported that listening to binaural beats can increase subjective feelings of relaxation and produce changes in autonomic arousal. The use of monaural beat stimulation has also been found to modulate state anxiety and reduce preoperative anxiety. However, further research is needed to determine the impact of binaural beats on cognitive performance and other mood measurements."
"Does the consumption of dairy products promote mucus and diseases of the ear, nose and throat?","['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,No,No,"The available scientific evidence does not support the claim that dairy product consumption promotes mucus and diseases of the ear, nose, and throat. While there is a commonly held belief that cow's milk products increase mucus production and respiratory symptoms, studies have found no strong evidence that high levels of dairy consumption are associated with an increased risk of respiratory diseases. In fact, a greater dairy consumption has been associated with a lower prevalence of metabolic syndrome, with calcium likely being the nutrient responsible for this association. Furthermore, the totality of available scientific evidence supports the intake of milk and dairy products for meeting nutrient recommendations and protecting against chronic diseases."
Do static magnets help against pain?,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",No,NEI,NEI,"Justification: The scientific evidence regarding the effectiveness of static magnets in treating pain is limited and controversial. While some studies suggest that static magnets may have a positive effect on pain reduction, others do not support this claim. The weight of evidence from well-conducted controlled trials suggests that static magnetic fields may induce analgesia, but the overall evidence does not support the use of static magnets for pain relief. Therefore, it is not possible to definitively state that static magnets help against pain."
"Do products from bees like honey, propolis, royal jelly or bee venom help against cancer?","['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"Justification: The context suggests that bee products, including honey, propolis, and royal jelly, have been studied for their potential therapeutic applications in various diseases, including cancer. The cytotoxic effects of particular tree-originated honeys from chestnut, cedar, pine, and multifloral honey have been investigated on cell lines representing different types of breast cancer. The results indicate that honey and propolis decreased p53 gene expression in certain cells and that honey produced faster healing in patients with chemotherapy-induced mucositis. Additionally, propolis extract increased the expression of the bcl-2 gene in all cell lines, while honey decreased it significantly. These findings suggest that bee products, such as honey and propolis, have potential anti-cancer activity and could be considered for future therapeutic trials targeting cancer."
Can stevia lower high blood pressure?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"The study indicates that stevia, specifically Stevia rebaudiana, has demonstrated antihypertensive effects in both human and animal models. This is achieved through its ability to reduce the cardiac action potential duration at 20%, 50%, and 90% of repolarisation. Furthermore, stevia has shown beneficial modulatory effects on cardiovascular and gastrointestinal tissues via calcium channel antagonism, activation of the m2 muscarinic receptor function, and enhanced nitric oxide release. In cardiomyocytes, stevia has been observed to attenuate the force of contraction, decrease the average peak amplitude, and shorten the repolarisation phase of the action potential. The study also notes that stevia caused relaxation of aortic tissues, which was significantly potentiated in the presence of verapamil. These findings suggest that stevia may play a role in lowering high blood pressure."
Does a diet that includes as many organic foods as possible lower the risk of cancer?,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",NEI,NEI,NEI,"(Not Enough Information)

     Justification: The context provided does not establish a clear association between organic food consumption and the incidence of cancer. While it is suggested that diets rich in fruits, vegetables, and plant-based foods are associated with a reduced risk of cancer, the specific impact of organic food consumption on cancer risk has not been synthesized or conclusively established. Therefore, it is not possible to definitively state that a diet including as many organic foods as possible lowers the risk of cancer based on the provided information."
Do products made from fenugreek seeds help you lose weight?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,The study indicates that the repeated administration of a fenugreek seed extract significantly decreased dietary fat consumption in healthy overweight subjects. The higher dose of fenugreek seed extract resulted in a decrease in daily fat consumption by 17.3% compared to the placebo. The ratio of fat reported energy intake to total energy expenditure was also significantly decreased in subjects administered the fenugreek seed extract relative to those receiving the placebo. The study also observed a significant decrease in the insulin/glucose ratio in subjects treated with fenugreek seed extract relative to the placebo group. These findings suggest that products made from fenugreek seeds may aid in weight loss by reducing fat consumption and improving insulin sensitivity.
Can low-level laser therapy reduce pain from knee or hip osteoarthritis?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The systematic review suggests that low-level laser therapy (LLLT) has the potential to reduce pain from knee or hip osteoarthritis. LLLT has been reported to be successful in relieving pain caused by various musculoskeletal disorders, including osteoarthritis. It is thought to have an analgesic effect and a biomodulatory effect on microcirculation. LLLT has been used as an alternative non-invasive treatment for osteoarthritis and has been shown to reduce pain in patients. However, it is important to note that the laser therapy dose protocol has not been completely established, and more research is needed to fully understand the effectiveness of LLLT in reducing pain from knee or hip osteoarthritis."

Further research and evidence are required to determine the effects of curd compresses in these specific situations."
Does consumption of dairy products in middle and advanced age protect against bone fractures?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",No,Yes,Yes,"The study suggests that higher milk and dairy food consumption are associated with a lower risk of hip fracture in older adults. The results indicate that greater intakes of milk and milk + yogurt may lower the risk for hip fracture in older adults through mechanisms that are partially, but not entirely, attributable to effects on bone mineral density. The findings show that total dairy food intake, of which milk contributed about half, was associated with a significant 6% lower risk of hip fracture per daily serving in men and women. The results also suggest a positive association of dairy intake with appendicular bone mineralization and muscle mass in elderly women."
Can apigenin reduce cancer risk or prevent cancer progression?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",No,Yes,Yes,"The context suggests that apigenin, a plant flavonoid, has shown potential in cancer prevention and inhibition of tumor growth. It has been found to reduce the proliferation of colon cancer cell lines and induce apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. Apigenin has also been reported to inhibit the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in human ovarian cancer cells, which is a critical factor in angiogenesis, a process that supports tumor growth. Furthermore, apigenin has been shown to elevate p53, a critical molecule in the induction of apoptosis. However, caution is advised in dietary intake of apigenin during disease as it potentially interferes with cancer treatment. Therefore, based on the context, it can be concluded that apigenin has the potential to reduce cancer risk and prevent cancer progression."
Does the drug Sovaldi (sofosbuvir) enable high cure rates for chronic hepatitis C?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"Justification: The drug Sovaldi (sofosbuvir) has demonstrated high cure rates for chronic hepatitis C in clinical studies. It has shown high antiviral activity across all genotypes of the hepatitis C virus (HCV). The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved sofosbuvir for the treatment of chronic HCV infection in December 2013. Sofosbuvir-based regimens have achieved excellent efficacy and safety in the treatment of chronic hepatitis C with various genotypes. The European Medicines Agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use has also recommended the approval of sofosbuvir for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C. The drug has been associated with high sustained virologic response (SVR) rates in real-life cohorts of patients with chronic hepatitis C infection, including those with cirrhosis."
,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The context suggests that ozonated vegetable oils have antimicrobial properties and have been tested for their antifungal activity against various fungal species. The o. azureus essential oil, in particular, has shown promise as an antifungal agent in the treatment of human dermatomycoses caused by filamentous fungi. The ""in vitro"" antifungal activity of ozonized sunflower oil was tested on yeasts originating from onychomycosis, and the results demonstrated that the oil had a strong detrimental effect on spore germination of all the tested dermatophytic fungi. Furthermore, the treatment of vegetable oils with ozone leads to the creation of a reservoir of ozone that slowly releases into the skin, which can help in the treatment of fungal infections. Therefore, it can be inferred that ozonated vegetable oil may help against athlete's foot or nail fungus."
"Can cold showers, cold baths or cold water treading according to Kneipp prevent colds and respiratory infections in adults?","['NEI', 'True', 'False']",NEI,NEI,NEI,"The provided context does not contain specific information on the prevention of colds and respiratory infections in adults through cold showers, cold baths, or cold water treading according to Kneipp. However, it does highlight the use of cold water immersion for cooling the body and treating exertional heatstroke, as well as its effectiveness in preventing and treating environmental cold injuries. The context also mentions the use of cold water immersion in various studies to investigate its effects on cognitive performance and rewarming profiles. Nonetheless, without specific evidence on the prevention of colds and respiratory infections, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer to the question."
Does electromagnetic radiation from cell phone towers cause health problems such as headaches or sleep disorders?,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",No,NEI,NEI,"The context suggests that there are concerns and ongoing debates regarding the potential health effects of electromagnetic radiation from cell phone towers. However, the consequences of long-term exposure to this radiation are still unknown. While some reports indicate that electromagnetic radiation may elicit biological effects, including headaches and sleep disorders, the available research data is limited. Therefore, it is not possible to definitively conclude that electromagnetic radiation from cell phone towers causes health problems such as headaches or sleep disorders. Further research is needed to fully understand the potential health impacts of this radiation."
Does eating eggs increase the risk of cardiovascular disease?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",No,Yes,Yes,"The relationship between egg and cholesterol intakes, and cardiovascular disease is controversial. However, several studies suggest that higher consumption of dietary cholesterol or eggs is significantly associated with a higher risk of incident cardiovascular disease (CVD) and all-cause mortality in a dose-response manner. Eggs are a rich source of dietary cholesterol, and when fed experimentally, dietary cholesterol increases serum cholesterol, which predicts the onset of coronary heart disease. Although some studies show that moderate egg consumption is not associated with a significant increase in CVD, stroke, heart failure, and type 2 diabetes mellitus, others dispute this fact and state that there is an association with increased egg consumption, especially if they are consumed with saturated fats. Therefore, it is recommended to consume eggs in moderation and avoid consuming them with saturated fats."
Can garlic extract reduce high blood pressure and thus the risk of cardiovascular disease?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The evidence suggests that garlic extract has the potential to reduce high blood pressure, which in turn may lower the risk of cardiovascular disease. A meta-analysis published in 2008 concluded that garlic consumption lowers blood pressure in both hypertensive and normotensive patients. Preclinical and clinical evidence has shown that garlic reduces risks associated with cardiovascular disease by lowering cholesterol, inhibiting platelet aggregation, and lowering blood pressure. Garlic supplements have shown effectiveness in reducing blood pressure in hypertensive patients, similarly to first-line standard anti-hypertensive medications. A trial including 47 hypertensive patients showed that garlic significantly reduces mean supine systolic blood pressure by 12 mmHg and mean supine diastolic blood pressure by 9 mmHg versus placebo. The meta-analysis suggests that garlic preparations are superior to placebo in reducing blood pressure in individuals with hypertension."
Can taking selenium prevent cancer?,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",No,NEI,NEI,"The potential of selenium in preventing cancer has been a subject of extensive research. Selenium has been shown to have chemo-preventive properties and has been effective in reducing the incidence of cancer in animal models and human clinical trials. It has been suggested that selenium supplementation may contribute to cancer preventive effects, particularly for prostate cancer. However, it is important to note that the molecular basis for these effects remains unclear. While epidemiological and clinical data suggest a reduced cancer incidence and mortality with higher selenium exposure, supplementation trials have not indicated a clear benefit. Therefore, while selenium may have a role in cancer prevention, further research is needed to establish its efficacy."
Does the pill affect the muscle strength of women??,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",No,No,No,"The data suggests that oral contraceptive use does not significantly affect muscle strength in women. In a small study, the androgenicity of the progestin in the contraceptive pill had no significant association with maximal strength in female athletes. Furthermore, there were no significant changes in the concentration of endogenous oestradiol or progesterone or any measure of muscle strength between pill phases. A study of 9704 participants aged 65 years or more found no evidence that postmenopausal estrogen use has beneficial effects on muscle strength or neuromuscular function. Therefore, based on the available data, it can be concluded that the pill does not affect the muscle strength of women."
Do extracts from grape seeds have a health-promoting effect?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The evidence suggests that extracts from grape seeds, particularly grape seed extract (GSE), have a range of health-promoting effects. GSE has been shown to have beneficial health effects in the prevention of dyslipidemia and cardiovascular diseases, as well as in preventing weight gain, moderating hyperglycemia, and reducing inflammation. The major polyphenols in grape seed, including proanthocyanidins, have been demonstrated to possess a wide range of health-beneficial properties. GSE has also been reported to improve endothelial function and arteriosclerosis, and to prevent early changes in glucose tolerance and alter small intestinal gut microbiota. The results of studies indicate a lack of toxicity and support the use of proanthocyanidin-rich extract from grape seeds for various foods."
Do mindfulness-based methods effect improvement in chronic pain?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"Mindfulness-based interventions have been shown to be effective in managing chronic pain. Numerous studies have demonstrated that mindfulness meditation reduces pain in both clinical and experimental settings. The unique mechanisms through which mindfulness meditation reduces pain have been identified, and it has been shown to be a promising treatment pathway for both depression and chronic pain. Higher levels of mindfulness have been associated with lower pain intensity and greater ability to be nonreactive to inner experiences, which has been linked to both pain intensity and upper extremity physical function. Mindfulness meditation has been found to produce greater pain relief than placebo cream and sham mindfulness meditation, and it has been found to be efficacious in reducing persistent pain in women treated for breast cancer. Although changing or controlling pain is not an explicit aim of mindfulness-based interventions, recent experimental studies suggest that mindfulness practice may lead to changes in pain tolerance and pain intensity ratings."
Is it possible to reliably detect coronavirus infection based only on symptoms but without laboratory testing?,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",No,No,No,"The diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) primarily relies on viral nucleic acid detection, as the clinical features are nonspecific and can be similar to other respiratory pathogens. In the absence of laboratory-based tests, such as a virus nucleic acid real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test, clinical diagnosis can be challenging. The presumed low diagnostic sensitivity of upper respiratory specimens for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) makes it difficult to confirm infection and recommend de-isolation. Therefore, it is not possible to reliably detect coronavirus infection based only on symptoms without laboratory testing."
Can a special mattress relieve nighttime rheumatism symptoms and thus improve sleep?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The context suggests that sleeping mattress parameters significantly influence sleeping comfort and health in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). It is also mentioned that articles examining the effect of temperature alterations of mattresses on promoting sleep quality and reducing pain were included in the research.

Therefore, further research is needed to fully understand the potential benefits and mechanisms of black cumin for asthma management."
Does red wine protect better against cardiovascular disease than white wine?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The context suggests that red wine may offer greater protection against cardiovascular disease than white wine. This is attributed to the higher levels of antioxidant polyphenols, such as resveratrol, found in red wine. These compounds have been shown to reduce oxidative stress in the heart, contributing to the prevention of coronary heart disease and atherosclerosis. Numerous epidemiological studies have documented the role of red wine in cardiovascular risk prevention, with moderate consumption linked to a reduced risk of coronary heart disease and lower overall mortality. Although the exact contribution of alcohol and antioxidants to these effects is unclear, it is likely that the cardioprotective effect of red wine is due to both these constituents."
Does quitting smoking prolong life?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"Quitting smoking has been shown to prolong life, as evidenced by numerous studies. The mortality hazards of smoking extend well into later life, suggesting that smoking cessation will continue to improve life expectancy in older people. Older smokers who quit have a reduced risk of death compared with current smokers within 1 to 2 years after quitting. Even those who quit much later in life gained some benefits: among smokers who quit at age 65 years, men gained 1.4 to 2.0 years of life, and women gained 2.7 to 3.7 years. Quitting smoking has several health benefits, including an improvement in health-related quality of life. Smoking cessation in older adults markedly reduces the risks of coronary events and of cardiac deaths within 1 year of quitting, and risk continues to decline more gradually for many years. Smokers who quit at younger ages realized greater life extensions. Nevertheless, at the population level, the prospects are excellent that smoking cessation after age 65 will extend both the number of years of life and the quality of life."
Does glutathione improve the tolerability of chemotherapy for cancer?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"Glutathione has been shown to be an effective chemoprotector against cisplatin-induced side effects in patients with ovarian cancer. The intensity of hematologic toxicity was significantly less pronounced in patients treated with glutathione than in the control group. Based on experimental and clinical studies, reduced glutathione is a protective agent against cisplatin-induced toxicity. A new high-dose regimen including glutathione as a chemoprotector was designed in an attempt to improve the efficacy and therapeutic index of cisplatin. Reduced glutathione is generally administered for patients with cancer to reduce the side-effects of anti-cancer drugs. Glutathione is a sulfur-containing nucleophile that protects against cisplatin-induced renal toxicity without reducing the antitumor activity of the cytotoxic agent."
,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"Research has consistently shown that therapeutic dancing can have a positive impact on the lives of people living with Parkinson's disease (PWP). Studies have demonstrated that dance can improve motor features in Parkinson's disease, specifically balance and motor symptom severity in individuals with mild to moderate PD. Controlled studies on group-delivered dance for people with mild-to-moderate stage Parkinson's have shown statistically and clinically significant improvements in gait, balance, and psychosocial factors. Additionally, tango dance interventions have been shown to preferentially improve mobility and motor signs in people with PD, compared to other dance interventions. Dance can serve as an adjunct to traditional treatments to improve gait, balance, and quality of life in people with PD. However, more research is needed to determine its effects on non-motor symptoms and quality of life."
Can taking the enzyme diamino oxidase prevent alcohol-related hangover symptoms?,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",NEI,No,No,"The provided context does not mention diamino oxidase as a potential preventative measure for alcohol-related hangover symptoms. Instead, it focuses on the roles of alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) in alcohol metabolism and their potential inhibition to alleviate hangover symptoms. The context also discusses the use of emetine, cimetidine, and disulfiram as potential therapeutic agents for alcoholism and hangover prevention. However, there is no mention of diamino oxidase in this context. Therefore, based on the information provided, it cannot be concluded that taking diamino oxidase can prevent alcohol-related hangover symptoms."
Does thyme strengthen memory or prevent mental decline?,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",NEI,No,No,"The context discusses the role of thymic peptides and thyroid functionality in cognitive functioning, particularly in elderly individuals and those with cognitive impairments. It suggests that interventions such as melatonin, arginine, or zinc may aid in the restoration of thymic functions and improve cognitive performance. However, the context does not provide evidence that thyme, the herb, has a direct effect on memory strengthening or preventing mental decline. The term ""thyme"" in the context refers to the thymus gland, not the herb."
Does healing clay with the clay mineral smectite help when children have diarrhea?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"Based on the available evidence, smectite, a medicinal clay, may offer a complementary intervention to reduce the duration of diarrhea in children with acute infectious diarrhea. The natural clay dioctahedral smectite increases intestinal barrier function and is effective against infectious diarrhea in children. Smectite used as an adjuvant to rehydration therapy may reduce the duration of diarrhea in children with acute infectious diarrhea by a day, increase cure rate by day 3, and reduce stool output. However, it has no effect on hospitalization rates or need for intravenous therapy. The administration of smectite was associated with a significant reduction of the duration of diarrhea, as judged by stool frequency and consistency. Smectite reduces the duration of diarrhea and prevents a prolonged course. Patients in the smectite group had a significantly shorter duration of diarrhea and significantly fewer stools. Diosmectite significantly decreased stool output in children with acute watery diarrhea, especially those who were rotavirus-positive. Smectite was safe and well tolerated, and had no impact on the adsorption of electrolytes."
Is belly fat or is a large abdominal girth particularly dangerous for health?,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"Abdominal fat, often referred to as belly fat, is particularly harmful to health. This is due to its strong association with various metabolic and cardiovascular diseases, as well as certain types of cancer. Abdominal obesity, or central obesity, is considered more adverse than overall obesity because of its link to insulin resistance and increased cardiovascular risk. The presence of excess fat in the abdominal area contributes to many metabolic disorders, including metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases. The abdominal visceral fat depot is considered the most atherogenic, diabetogenic, and hypertensiogenic fat depot in the human body. The high levels of abdominal visceral fat observed in some adults are of critical importance in the metabolic complications of obesity. Therefore, it is accurate to state that belly fat or a large abdominal girth is particularly dangerous for health."
"Does injecting low-dose Corona vaccine into the skin (mesotherapy vaccination, microvaccination) protect against Covid-19 as well as proven full-dose vaccination into muscle?","['NEI', 'True', 'False']",NEI,No,No,"The context suggests that a minimally-invasive microneedle patch for skin vaccination with virus-like particles was developed, which could offer a promising approach to develop an easy-to-administer universal influenza vaccine. However, there is no direct evidence to suggest that injecting low-dose Corona vaccine into the skin (mesotherapy vaccination, microvaccination) protects against Covid-19 as well as proven full-dose vaccination into muscle. In fact, the context suggests that a single intramuscular or intragastric administration of recombinant adenoviral type 5 (ad5) or type 41 (ad41) -based vaccines expressing the mers-cov spike (s) protein was evaluated, but no comparison was made to low-dose vaccination into the skin. Therefore, based on the available information, it cannot be concluded that low-dose Corona vaccine injected into the skin provides the same level of protection as full-dose vaccination into muscle."
Does transcranial direct current stimulation help against severe depression?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has been identified as a promising intervention for major depression, with growing evidence suggesting its potential as an effective treatment. This noninvasive brain stimulation technique involves the application of a weak current through the scalp to induce changes in neuronal excitability. Recent double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials have indicated that tDCS may be efficacious in the treatment of depression, with several clinical studies suggesting clinically meaningful efficacy. Furthermore, tDCS has been increasingly used over the past decade in the treatment of neurological and psychiatric disorders, including depression. It is important to note, however, that the effects of tDCS on distinct symptoms of depression are not yet fully understood."
"Does daily flossing protect against tooth decay, periodontitis and tooth loss?","['NEI', 'True', 'False']",NEI,NEI,NEI,"The evidence regarding the effectiveness of daily flossing for preventing tooth decay, periodontitis, and tooth loss is weak and unreliable. While some studies suggest that flossing in addition to toothbrushing may be associated with a small reduction in plaque at 1 and 3 months, none of the included trials reported data for the outcomes of caries, calculus, clinical attachment loss, or quality of life. Furthermore, the use of an essential oil-containing mouthrinse was found to be at least as effective as daily flossing in reducing interproximal plaque and gingivitis. Therefore, it is not possible to definitively conclude that daily flossing protects against tooth decay, periodontitis, and tooth loss."
"Can the combination of propolis, xyloglucan, gelatin and hibiscus (product ""Utipro Plus"") relieve the symptoms of cystitis or prevent cystitis?","['NEI', 'True', 'False']",NEI,NEI,NEI,"The context provided does not contain information regarding the specific combination of propolis, xyloglucan, gelatin, and hibiscus (Utipro Plus) and its potential to relieve or prevent cystitis. While propolis has been shown to have anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antimicrobial properties, and has been used in the treatment of interstitial cystitis, the efficacy of the specific combination in Utipro Plus is not addressed in the provided context. Therefore, it is not possible to definitively answer the question based on the information given."
Does honey help against acute cough in children?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"The evidence suggests that honey may be effective in reducing the frequency and bothersome nature of acute cough in children. It has been observed to improve the sleep quality of the child, but not significantly affect the severity of the cough or the sleep quality of the parents. The World Health Organization recognizes honey as a potential demulcent treatment for cough, and it is recommended by the Australian guidelines for non-specific acute paediatric cough. The results of a short-cut review and clinical trials suggest that honey may provide better cough relief than dextromethorphan (DPH) and improve the sleep quality of children and their parents. However, further research is needed to fully understand the therapeutic effects of honey on mucus and cough characteristics."
,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"Justification: The context suggests that benzodiazepine use is significantly associated with an increased risk of dementia. Multiple observational studies have found that the odds of dementia were higher in those who used benzodiazepines compared to those who did not. Long-term use of benzodiazepines and long-acting benzodiazepines were found to be strongly associated with an increased risk of dementia. The association between benzodiazepine use and dementia incidence is not purely an artefact due to protopathic bias. Higher dose z-drug use in dementia is also associated with increased fracture and stroke risks, similar or greater to that for higher dose benzodiazepines."
Does taking probiotics shorten the duration of acute infectious diarrhea?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",No,Yes,Yes,"The evidence suggests that probiotics can reduce the duration of acute infectious diarrhea. A review of 15 studies found that probiotics reduced the risk of diarrhea at 3 days and the mean duration of diarrhea by 30.48 hours. Additionally, a clinical trial demonstrated that patients with Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) who underwent adjunctive treatment with lactobacillus and bifidobacterium probiotics had a reduction in diarrheal duration. Probiotics have also been shown to be beneficial in treating acute infectious diarrhea in children, particularly in cases of watery diarrhea and viral gastroenteritis. Furthermore, probiotics appear to be a useful adjunct to rehydration therapy in treating acute, infectious diarrhea in adults and children. Therefore, the evidence supports the use of probiotics to shorten the duration of acute infectious diarrhea."
Does flu vaccination reduce the likelihood of getting the flu (influenza)?,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"The context suggests that flu vaccination is associated with a reduced risk of influenza illness. Studies have shown that vaccination can provide meaningful protection against laboratory-confirmed influenza infections, with an overall risk reduction of up to 55.0%. The model also indicates that even in the presence of vaccine interference, revaccination can reduce the influenza attack rate and provide individual benefits. Furthermore, vaccination in both the current and previous seasons was associated with a higher vaccine effectiveness against hospitalization with influenza than vaccination in either single season. Therefore, it can be concluded that flu vaccination reduces the likelihood of getting the flu."
Are children conceived in May more likely to be born prematurely than children conceived in other months?,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",Yes,No,No,"The context does not provide specific information on the likelihood of preterm births based on the month of conception. However, it does mention that the mean month of conception was June, and that the uncertainty of due dates may influence the timing of birth. The context also highlights the risks associated with preterm births, including increased risk of underweight, stunting, and developmental delays. However, it does not provide a direct comparison between the likelihood of preterm births for children conceived in May and those conceived in other months. Therefore, based on the given context, it is not possible to conclude that children conceived in May are more likely to be born prematurely than children conceived in other months."
Does a cold spray with trypsin protect against colds or covid-19? Does the spray reduce symptoms and duration of illness?,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",NEI,NEI,NEI,"The context provided does not contain information on the use of a cold spray with trypsin for the prevention or treatment of colds or COVID-19. The studies mentioned focus on the use of carrageenan-containing nasal sprays and heated water vapor (steam) for symptom relief in patients with the common cold. The efficacy of a cold spray with trypsin in reducing symptoms and duration of illness for colds or COVID-19 is not addressed in the given context. Therefore, there is not enough information to make a determination."
Do earrings cause discomfort by destroying acupuncture points or meridians?,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",NEI,No,No,"The context provided does not support the claim that earrings cause discomfort by destroying acupuncture points or meridians. Instead, it highlights various medical problems associated with ear piercing and wearing earrings, such as local infection, sepsis, and contact dermatitis. The context also discusses the use of auricular acupuncture for pain relief, its effectiveness, and the criticism surrounding its clinical specificity. However, there is no mention of earrings causing discomfort by destroying acupuncture points or meridians."
Are rapid antigen tests as reliable as slower PCR tests? Does a negative (inconspicuous) rapid test result reliably exclude an infection with the coronavirus?,"['NEI', 'False', 'True']",No,No,No,"The rapid serological test had a sensitivity of 30% and a specificity of 89% compared to the standard RT-PCR assay. This indicates that rapid antigen tests are less reliable than RT-PCR tests in detecting the virus. A negative rapid test result does not reliably exclude an infection with the coronavirus, as the test may produce false-negative results. In contrast, RT-PCR testing is the gold standard for confirming COVID-19 infection, despite its disadvantages. However, technical issues limit its utilization for large-scale screening. Low-dose chest CT is a safe, rapid, and reliable alternative to RT-PCR for the diagnosis of COVID-19 in high-prevalence regions."
Do injections with Botulinum Toxin A (Botox®) help with urinary incontinence?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"The use of Botulinum Toxin A (Botox®) injections for the treatment of urinary incontinence has been widely accepted in the medical communities of urology and urogynecology. These injections have been found to be effective in managing lower urinary tract symptoms, including overactive bladder and detrusor overactivity, whether of neurogenic or idiopathic etiology. The application of Botulinum Toxin A in the lower urinary tract has produced promising results in treating lower urinary tract dysfunction. Intradetrusor injections of Botulinum Toxin A into patients with detrusor overactivity have resulted in significant increases in mean maximum cystometric capacity and detrusor compliance, with a reduction in mean maximum detrusor pressures. Furthermore, Botulinum Toxin A injections into the external urethral sphincter have been successfully used to treat detrusor sphincter dyssynergia and have recently been expanded to include voiding dysfunction. Therefore, it can be concluded that Botulinum Toxin A injections are an effective treatment for urinary incontinence."
Is it harmful to health to eat apple cores with the apple?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",No,No,No,"The context suggests that apple consumption, including the peels, is associated with numerous health benefits. The peels, which are part of the apple core, contain high concentrations of phenolic compounds that may assist in the prevention of chronic diseases, including cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, obesity, and cancer. The study also mentions that apple peels should not be discarded from the diet. However, it is important to note that the context also mentions the risk of a mycotoxin, patulin, produced by a mold that invades wounded apples. Therefore, it is advisable to avoid consuming damaged or decayed parts of the apple, including the core if it appears to be affected. Overall, the context does not suggest that eating apple cores is harmful to health, but it is important to ensure that the apple is not damaged or decayed."
Does regular exercise reduce the severity and duration of colds and other respiratory infections?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"Regular, moderate-intensity exercise has been shown to have a positive impact on the prevention, severity, and duration of acute respiratory infections, including the common cold. Studies have demonstrated that regular moderate exercise can enhance immune function and reduce the incidence of infections compared to a sedentary lifestyle. This is likely due to the anti-inflammatory effects and improved immune effector functions associated with regular exercise. However, it is important to note that very prolonged bouts of exercise and periods of intensified training may increase infection risk. Therefore, maintaining a consistent, moderate-to-vigorous-intensity exercise routine is recommended for optimal health benefits and disease protection."
Can laser irradiation of blood by infusion needle (hemolaser treatment) relieve discomfort or help with diseases?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The in vitro studies have demonstrated that laser irradiation can improve the rheological properties of blood, such as reducing blood viscosity, enhancing erythrocyte deformability, and lowering erythrocyte sedimentation rate. These effects suggest that laser irradiation of blood could potentially relieve discomfort or help with diseases. Furthermore, clinical studies have shown that laser therapy is a valuable method for pain treatment and the acceleration of wound healing. In the treatment of hemorrhoids, laser therapy has been found to be effective in pain alleviation from the first session and patients so treated have a much more comfortable postoperative course. Therefore, it is plausible that laser irradiation of blood by infusion needle (hemolaser treatment) could have similar therapeutic effects. However, further clinical trials are needed to confirm the efficacy and safety of this treatment modality."
Is it harmful to health to regularly eat large quantities of fish contaminated with dioxins and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs)?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"It is harmful to health to regularly consume large quantities of fish contaminated with dioxins and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Fish are known to accumulate these toxic compounds, which can lead to higher body burdens in humans who consume them. Compared to other animal-based foods, fish contain the highest levels of PCBs, polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins, and polychlorinated dibenzofurans, all of which are classified as highly toxic organochlorine compounds. The human population is primarily exposed to these pollutants through the ingestion of contaminated fish and fishery products. Dietary exposure to these compounds poses a potential threat to human health, particularly for individuals who consume fish with higher fat levels."
Can taking chondroitin relieve osteoarthritis pain or improve mobility in the long term?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",No,Yes,Yes,"The context suggests that chondroitin sulfate has been shown to relieve pain and improve functional limitation in patients with osteoarthritis of the knee in numerous clinical trials and meta-analyses. Chondroitin sulfate is referred to as a symptomatic slow-acting drug for osteoarthritis because it improves articular function, reduces joint swelling and effusion, and may have a role as a structure-modifying agent in the management of patients with knee osteoarthritis. The preparations applied in the treatment of degenerative joint disease, containing chondroitin sulfate, are attributed numerous therapeutic and chondroprotective properties including stabilizing synthesis processes and cartilage degradation, an increased proteoglycan and hyaluronic acid biosynthesis, and a decreased collagen II degradation. Chondroitin sulfate has an excellent safety profile and has been shown to have a beneficial effect on symptoms and structure in various meta-analyses. Although the long-term efficacy of chondroitin sulfate is not fully understood, it has been shown to prevent joint space narrowing of the knee and has established benefits, including relief of pain and increased range of motion."
Does vitamin D protect against dementia or memory loss?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The evidence suggests that vitamin D may have a protective role against dementia and memory loss. Studies have found that vitamin D is implicated in procognitive and neuroprotective functions, including the reduction of Alzheimer's disease hallmarks such as amyloid beta and phosphorylated tau. Cross-sectional studies have consistently found that vitamin D concentrations are significantly lower in individuals with Alzheimer's disease and cognitive impairment compared to healthy controls. Higher vitamin D status has been associated with reduced problems memorizing new information in older community-dwellers. Additionally, vitamin D is involved in the clearance of β-amyloid from the brain. However, results from longitudinal studies examining the association of vitamin D with incident dementia and cognitive impairment have been inconsistent. Therefore, further research is needed to determine the extent of vitamin D's protective role against dementia and memory loss."
Can taking chlorophyll change mouth or body odor?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"Justification: The context indicates that chlorophyllin, a derivative of chlorophyll, has antimicrobial activity against a range of organisms, including bacteria. Bacteria are known to contribute to body odor, including mouth odor. Therefore, it can be inferred that taking chlorophyll may change mouth or body odor by reducing the number of odor-causing bacteria. However, the context does not provide direct evidence of this specific effect, and further research would be needed to confirm it."
"Are soy foods risky for people with unremarkable, or subclinical, hypothyroidism?","['NEI', 'True', 'False']",NEI,No,No,"The study conducted with a pharmacological dose of 66 mg of soy phytoestrogens did not increase the overt thyroid failure rate or alter thyroid function tests in patients with subclinical hypothyroidism. Although there are concerns that soy can have a negative effect on thyroid function and can alter the levels of thyroid hormones, the study found that soy supplementation has no effect on the thyroid hormones and only very modestly raises TSH levels. The clinical significance of the rise in TSH is unclear. Therefore, it can be concluded that soy foods are not risky for people with unremarkable, or subclinical, hypothyroidism."
Are health checks of symptom-free individuals (screening) effective in containing the pandemic?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,", with conditions

     Screening of asymptomatic individuals is a crucial public health strategy for early detection and intervention in infectious diseases, including pandemics. The purpose of screening is to identify asymptomatic disease or risk factors, enabling interventions to occur as early as possible in the disease process. For infectious diseases, screening can benefit not only the individual but also the community by identifying and treating infectious persons before they transmit the disease to others. However, the effectiveness of screening in containing a pandemic depends on several factors. These include the condition's prevalence in the population, the availability of an accurate screening test, effective treatment, adequate resources, and efficient health services. Screening will only succeed if enough persons with the disease are identified and treated to justify the cost and stress experienced by those who test positive but do not have the disease. Therefore, while health checks of symptom-free individuals can be effective in containing a pandemic, their success is contingent on various factors and conditions."
Can the so-called Tupler technique help against rectus diastasis?,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",NEI,NEI,NEI,"The context provided does not contain information on the Tupler technique and its effectiveness against rectus diastasis. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer based solely on the given information. Further research or additional context is required to determine the efficacy of the Tupler technique in addressing rectus diastasis."
,"['True', 'False', 'NEI']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The data suggests that chronic copper exposure is linked to the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD) neuropathology. Copper is implicated in the pathogenesis of AD, as it promotes misfolding and toxicity of amyloid-β, and copper-modulating interventions have been shown to reduce amyloid pathology in animal models. Chronic copper exposure accelerates not only amyloid pathology but also tau pathology in a mouse model of AD. Copper exposure may increase the risk for AD by promoting a toxic buildup of amyloid-beta and neurofibrillary tangle pathology in the brain. A dysfunction in copper homeostasis seems to occur in AD, and copper dyshomeostasis has been suggested as an aetiological risk factor for some neurodegenerative diseases, including AD. Although the mechanism is not completely known, the positive relationship between copper and AD has been reported by a lot of epidemiological data."
Does calcium help with allergy?,"['True', 'False', 'NEI']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The study indicates that calcium plays a significant role in allergic reactions, with calcium ions being critical for airway smooth muscle contraction, degranulation of mast cells, and secretion of mucus. The placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover study demonstrates that 1000 mg of calcium administered orally significantly inhibits the allergen-induced swelling of the nasal mucosa in the allergen provocation test. This suggests that calcium can help with allergic rhinitis, a symptom of allergy. Furthermore, the ""Ca2+ hypothesis of asthma"" proposes that calcium channel blocking agents may have a beneficial effect in asthma, another condition related to allergies. In vitro, calcium antagonists have been shown to inhibit mediator release from mast cells, passively sensitized human lung fragments, and leukocytes, which could modify allergic bronchoconstriction. Therefore, the evidence supports the notion that calcium can help with allergy."
Does magnetic resonance therapy improve complaints of knee osteoarthritis or herniated discs (e.g. pain)?,"['NEI', 'False', 'True']",No,No,No,"The context provided primarily discusses the diagnostic value of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in knee disorders, including osteoarthritis and meniscal injuries. While MRI is a valuable tool for accurately diagnosing soft tissue disorders and augmenting the diagnostic process, the context does not provide evidence that magnetic resonance therapy, which is not the same as MRI, improves complaints of knee osteoarthritis or herniated discs. In fact, the context suggests that the role of MRI in improving patient outcomes is controversial. Therefore, based on the provided context, it cannot be concluded that magnetic resonance therapy improves complaints of knee osteoarthritis or herniated discs."
Does HPV vaccination reduce the risk of cervical cancer in girls?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination has been shown to be an effective method for reducing the risk of cervical cancer in girls. The HPV vaccine has a significant impact on the incidence of cervical cancer, as it protects against HPV infections responsible for 70% of cervical cancer diagnoses. The vaccine is recommended for girls aged 11-26 years and has the potential to greatly reduce the incidence of cervical cancer. However, it is important to note that inequalities in cervical cancer may be increased following mass vaccination if girls with low vaccine uptake also have low future participation in cervical cancer screening. Additionally, preliminary research has indicated that women vaccinated against HPV may be less likely to undergo cervical cancer screening and engage in safe sexual behavior. Nonetheless, HPV vaccination reduces the risk of developing malignant lesions and is expected to change the dynamics of HPV transmission. The HPV vaccine significantly reduces the risk of HPV infection and subsequent cervical cancer diagnosis, and its underuse is linked to lack of knowledge of its effectiveness in preventing cervical cancer."
,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"The extract from St. John's wort has been found to be effective in relieving symptoms of mild to moderate depression, as supported by a large number of scientific publications. Published meta-analyses have shown that St. John's wort extracts are more effective than placebo and equally as effective as tricyclic antidepressants in the short-term management of mild to moderate depression. The mode of action of St. John's wort is different from that of conventional antidepressant drugs, which elevate brain serotonin and evoke negative feedback control of serotonergic neurons. The content of the acylphloroglucinol hyperforin in St. John's wort extracts has been suggested to decisively contribute to its antidepressant efficacy. However, the efficacy of St. John's wort for treating major depression, cyclothymia, or bipolar disorder is less evident."
Does CBD (cannabidiol) relieve symptoms of mild to moderate covid-19 disease?,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",No,NEI,NEI,"The context provided does not contain information regarding the use of cannabidiol (CBD) in the treatment or symptom relief of mild to moderate COVID-19 disease. While CBD has been shown to exhibit significant efficacy in mental and inflammatory diseases, its potential as an antiviral or for the treatment of viral diseases has received limited attention. Further research is needed to establish if CBD can relieve symptoms of mild to moderate COVID-19 disease."
Does hyperthermia treatment support chemotherapy in fighting cancer? (anonymous request with link to the Standard article),"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"Hyperthermia has been shown to support chemotherapy in fighting cancer. It is a noninvasive treatment that causes tumor cells to become heated, and it works in synergy with anticancer drugs and radiation therapy. Hyperthermia is used in cancer therapy, particularly in combination with systemic chemotherapy or radiotherapy. It has been found to potentiate the cytotoxicity of radiation and certain chemotherapy drugs, making it an attractive adjunctive modality in the treatment of cancer. Hyperthermia is currently being evaluated in clinical studies as a potential method of cancer treatment, and it has been shown to improve the efficacy of non-surgical methods of cancer treatment. In oncology, hyperthermia is used to treat malignant diseases by administering heat in various ways, and it has been found to enable tumor stroma to provide a sensitizing environment for tumor cells to undergo cell death. Hyperthermia is a promising treatment for human cervical cancer and has been used as an alternative to surgery or in combination with chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy in the treatment of oral squamous cell carcinoma."
Can negative expectancy reduce the effect of pain medications?,"['True', 'False', 'NEI']",No,Yes,Yes,"Research has shown that negative expectancy can indeed reduce the effect of pain medications. This phenomenon is known as the nocebo effect, where negative expectations about a treatment can lead to a decrease in its effectiveness. Negative preconceived beliefs about the benefits of pain medications, such as morphine, have been associated with reports of severe pain and poor patient satisfaction. Interventions designed to change patients' expectations have been found to have a small effect on pain experience. It is hypothesized that placebos reduce pain by reducing negative emotions, and the new aspect of this model is that expectations reduce negative emotions, which in turn reduce symptoms. Therefore, managing patient expectations through strategies such as providing enhanced information and optimizing patient-physician communication can help to prevent, minimize, or extinguish the nocebo effect in clinical settings."
"Does the product ""BestProvita Diabetin"" improve blood glucose levels in type 2 diabetes or does it prevent secondary diseases?","['NEI', 'True', 'False']",NEI,NEI,NEI,"The provided context does not contain any information regarding the product ""BestProvita Diabetin"". Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether this product improves blood glucose levels in type 2 diabetes or prevents secondary diseases. The context discusses various pharmacological therapies for managing type 2 diabetes, including dipeptidyl peptidase (dpp)-4 inhibitors, sodium-glucose cotransporter (sglt)-2 inhibitors, and other oral agents, but it does not mention ""BestProvita Diabetin"" specifically. Further information is needed to answer the question accurately."
Can the genetic blood test for Down syndrome (trisomy 21) predict whether the unborn child is affected - in pregnant women at increased risk?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"The genetic blood test, also known as maternal serum screening, can predict whether the unborn child is affected by Down syndrome (trisomy 21) in pregnant women at increased risk. This test measures the levels of certain substances in the mother's blood, such as alpha-fetoprotein and human chorionic gonadotropin, which can indicate an increased risk for Down syndrome in the fetus. The test has been shown to be effective in detecting Down syndrome due to rare chromosome rearrangements and is an important tool for providing appropriate genetic counseling. Additionally, first-trimester screening for trisomy 21 by fetal nuchal translucency thickness has been shown to significantly increase the detection rate for Down syndrome and decrease the rate of false-positive results."
Is a lot of sunlight in childhood and adolescence a cause of age-related macular degeneration?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The evidence suggests that prolonged exposure to sunlight, specifically ultraviolet (UV) radiation, can cause cumulative damage to the retina, potentially leading to age-related macular degeneration (AMD). The intensity and duration of solar exposure are key factors in the extent of retinal damage and associated visual impairment. While the context does not explicitly mention childhood and adolescence, it does emphasize the role of long-term exposure to sunlight in the development of AMD. Therefore, it can be inferred that a lot of sunlight in childhood and adolescence could contribute to the development of AMD later in life."
Do remedies with ginkgo help against tinnitus in people with dementia?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The use of Ginkgo Biloba extracts, such as EGb 761, has been found to alleviate tinnitus in elderly patients in earlier clinical trials. Ginkgo Biloba is a traditional herbal medicinal plant used for the treatment of mild to moderate cognitive disorders, tinnitus, and dementia. The herb has been used in the treatment of various common geriatric complaints including vertigo, short-term memory loss, hearing loss, lack of attention, vigilance, and cerebral vascular disorder. Clinical trials report that Ginkgo Biloba extracts reduce cognitive symptoms in age-associated memory impairment and dementia, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Based on compelling experimental and clinical evidence, Ginkgo Biloba exerts a beneficial effect in ameliorating mild to moderate dementia in patients with Alzheimer's disease and other neurological disorders. Although the pharmacological mechanisms remain unknown, Ginkgo Biloba is a plant extract used to alleviate symptoms associated with cognitive deficits, including tinnitus and dizziness."
"Can electromagnetic fields with a specific pattern (pulsed electromagnetic fields, PEMF) heal injuries?","['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,".

     Pulsed electromagnetic fields (PEMFs) have been shown to accelerate healing after bone fractures and alleviate pain, according to several studies. PEMFs exert biological effects and are clinically used to facilitate bone repair and wound healing. Specific PEMFs have been used to stimulate growth and repair of osteogenic tissues, and have been found to be beneficial to a wide variety of biological phenomena. Nonthermal PEMFs have been successfully employed as adjunctive therapy for the treatment of delayed and non-union fractures, fresh fractures, and chronic wounds. The use of PEMFs is emerging as an interesting therapeutic option for patients with cancer. Previous studies have reported enhanced fracture and chronic wound healing, endothelial cell growth, and angiogenesis with the use of PEMFs."
Are paper towels or electric dryers more hygienic after washing hands?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"From a hygiene perspective, paper towels are often considered superior to electric air dryers. Studies have shown that paper towels can effectively dry hands, remove bacteria, and cause less contamination of the washroom environment. The use of jet air dryers has been found to be the best method for eliminating bacteria on hands, while drying hands on one's own clothes is the least effective. However, paper towels are generally accepted as the most hygienic means of drying hands and are often distributed from generic dispensers. The log reduction was often greater with paper towels than with warm air for fingertips, and for palms and fingers, log reductions were greater with warm air drying while holding hands stationary, paper towels, and warm air drying while rubbing hands. No significant difference in bacteria reduction was detected between the use of one or two paper towels for hand drying. Therefore, using fewer resources is recommended to maintain environmental sustainability. In locations where hygiene is paramount, such as hospitals and clinics, paper towels should be recommended."
Do herbal remedies with nasturtium and horseradish (Kren) prevent recurrent cystitis?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",No,Yes,Yes,"The context suggests that herbal remedies containing nasturtium and horseradish can be used preventatively to aid in the treatment of urinary tract infections (UTIs). The study examines the efficacy of various herbal infusions in treating and reducing the symptoms of UTIs, including those caused by nasturtium and horseradish. The results indicate that herbal infusions of wild thyme extract and birch leaf, as well as infusions at higher concentrations, have the greatest efficacy in preventing and treating UTIs. Therefore, it can be inferred that herbal remedies containing nasturtium and horseradish may also prevent recurrent cystitis."
Is graviola an effective and safe treatment for cancer?,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",NEI,NEI,NEI,"The context provided discusses the in vitro anticancer effects of graviola, specifically its anti-proliferative and apoptosis-inducing action against human breast cancer cells. The results suggest that this natural compound, garcinol, merits investigation as a potential chemo-preventive/-therapeutic agent, especially against breast cancer. However, it is important to note that graviola has not been studied in humans, and its safety and effectiveness as a cancer treatment in humans remain unknown. Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to definitively state whether graviola is an effective and safe treatment for cancer."
Does turmeric prevent or cure cancer?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The context indicates that turmeric, specifically its active constituent curcumin, has a strong potential for cancer prevention and treatment. Studies have shown that turmeric or curcumin significantly inhibits tumor promotion and can effectively block the proliferation of tumor cells through the suppression of nf-κb and stat3 pathways. Furthermore, turmeric has been found to augment apoptosis of the initiated cells and decrease cell proliferation in dmba-treated animals, leading to decreased tumor burden, multiplicity, and enhanced latency period. These results suggest that dietary turmeric is an effective anti-mutagen and may be useful in chemoprevention. Additionally, turmeric has been observed to sensitize tumor cells to chemotherapeutic agents capecitabine and taxol. Therefore, based on the context, it can be concluded that turmeric has the potential to prevent and possibly treat cancer."
Do vaginal suppositories containing the active ingredient imiquimod cause precancerous stages of cervical cancer to recede or disappear?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"The study demonstrates that the topical application of imiquimod, in the form of a 5% cream, has been effective in the regression of vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN) and vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia (VAIN). The results indicate that the imiquimod-loaded nanoemulsion can be an alternative product for the treatment of cervical cancer. In a study involving 76 women with persistent HPV infection after surgical therapy for cervical or vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN or VAIN), 58 of the 76 patients (76.3%) were clear of HPV infection and had normal pap smears after administration of imiquimod cream. The topical application of the immune response modifier imiquimod is an alternative approach for the treatment of HPV-positive vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN) and aims at the immunologic eradication of HPV-infected cells. Although atypia or mild dysplasia was noted in 15 of the 18 patients (83.3%) with persistent HPV infection after imiquimod cream treatment, the degree of severity was noticeably less than the initial diagnosis in most of these patients. Therefore, it can be concluded that vaginal suppositories containing the active ingredient imiquimod can cause precancerous stages of cervical cancer to recede or disappear."
Can a tantrum trigger a heart attack?,"['True', 'False', 'NEI']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"Justification: The context suggests that emotional stress can trigger cardiac events, such as acute coronary syndrome, which is often characterized by myocardial stunning of neurogenic origin. This is supported by the frequent antecedent of emotional or physical stress, suggesting a catecholamine-mediated mechanism. Furthermore, psychological stress is identified as a trigger in 16% of cases of sudden cardiac death. A tantrum, being a sudden and intense emotional outburst, can be considered a form of psychological stress. Therefore, it is plausible that a tantrum could trigger a heart attack."
,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",NEI,NEI,NEI,"While numerous epidemiological studies suggest a potential link between aluminum intake and the development of Alzheimer's disease, the exact role of aluminum in the etiology of Alzheimer's disease remains controversial. Aluminum, a known neurotoxin, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease and is considered a potential etiological factor. However, the extent to which aluminum intake contributes to the development of Alzheimer's disease is not fully understood. Further research is needed to establish a definitive causal relationship between aluminum intake and Alzheimer's disease."
Can CBD help with period pain?,"['NEI', 'False', 'True']",NEI,NEI,NEI,"The context provided discusses the effectiveness of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) in managing chronic pain, including its ability to improve psychosocial functioning, empathy, and coping strategies. However, there is no mention of CBD (cannabidiol) or its potential role in managing period pain. Therefore, based on the provided context, there is not enough information to determine whether CBD can help with period pain. Further research and evidence are needed to make a conclusive statement."
Does particulate matter pollution increase the risk of heart attack - even if the EU limits are complied with?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"Numerous epidemiological studies have demonstrated a causal relationship between exposure to particulate matter (PM) air pollution and an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases, including ischemic heart disease and myocardial infarction. Long-term exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) has been associated with an elevated risk of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. Although the specific mechanisms by which PM affects the heart are not fully understood, it is believed to influence the parasympathetic regulation of the heart. Despite compliance with EU limits, high concentrations of PM air pollution have been linked to increased morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular events. Therefore, particulate matter pollution is considered an important modifiable environmental risk factor for cardiovascular health."
Do air ions cause an improvement of asthma??,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",No,NEI,NEI,"The available evidence on the effectiveness of positive and negative ion generators in people with asthma is often inconclusive. Although a slight but significant improvement in lung function was demonstrated in nine patients during positive and negative ion exposure, there were no significant differences in symptoms or beta-2 agonist usage between ionised and control air in three studies. Furthermore, the use of ionisers cannot be recommended in the homes of asthmatic subjects to improve their symptoms. Therefore, it is not possible to definitively state that air ions cause an improvement of asthma."
Does sitting for long periods shorten the lifespan?,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",Yes,No,No,"The study suggests that prolonged sitting was not independently associated with lung cancer incidence. However, those who sit for prolonged periods and are physically inactive have an increased incidence of lung cancer compared to those who sit less and are physically active. This implies that physical inactivity, rather than prolonged sitting itself, may contribute to a shorter lifespan. Furthermore, the study found no association between total sitting time daily and the incidence of lung cancer overall and histologic subtypes. Therefore, based on the given context, it can be concluded that sitting for long periods does not directly shorten the lifespan. However, it is important to note that physical inactivity, which may be associated with prolonged sitting, can have a negative impact on health and lifespan."
Can an anti-oxidant such as pseudocatalase stop or reverse hair graying?,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",NEI,NEI,NEI,"The context provided does not specifically mention the use of pseudocatalase in relation to hair graying. However, it does discuss the role of antioxidants, such as pomegranate extract and catalase, in preventing hair color fading and oxidative stress. The context suggests that antioxidants can reduce the alterations of hair color caused by free radicals generated by solar radiation. While this does not directly address the question of whether pseudocatalase can stop or reverse hair graying, it does provide a basis for understanding the potential role of antioxidants in maintaining hair color. Further research is needed to determine the specific effects of pseudocatalase on hair graying."
Can ingredients from pomegranate lower elevated blood pressure or reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"Numerous studies have demonstrated that pomegranate intake can help lower blood pressure and reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease through various mechanisms. Pomegranate consumption has been shown to influence systolic blood pressure, angiotensin-converting enzyme activity, oxidative stress, and vascular morphology. The antioxidant properties of pomegranate, particularly its polyphenol content, have been suggested to contribute to its cardiovascular health benefits. Clinical studies have indicated that pomegranate juice can reduce blood pressure in both the short-term and long-term. Furthermore, pomegranate peel extract has been shown to confer protection against hypertension. The anti-hypertensive effects of pomegranate have been reported for both its juice and seed oil. The ability of pomegranate polyphenols to inhibit platelet function may also contribute to its cardiovascular health benefits. In conclusion, the evidence suggests that ingredients from pomegranate can lower elevated blood pressure and reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease."
Do self-performed nasal drill tests in symptom-free individuals detect coronavirus infection as reliably as professionally performed rapid tests using swabs from the nasopharynx?,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",NEI,NEI,NEI,"The context provided does not explicitly address the question of whether self-performed nasal swabs in symptom-free individuals can detect coronavirus infection as reliably as professionally performed rapid tests using nasopharyngeal swabs. However, the context does suggest that self-collected nasal swabs have been shown to be feasible and as sensitive as clinician-collected nasal washes for the detection of respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2. The context also indicates that combined throat/nasal swabs yield a similar sensitivity to detect SARS-CoV-2 as nasopharyngeal swabs, and that nasal self-swabbing has been shown to be equivalent to staff-swabbing in terms of pathogen detection. However, the context does not provide information on the reliability of self-performed nasal swabs in symptom-free individuals specifically, or on the comparison of self-performed nasal swabs to professionally performed rapid tests using nasopharyngeal swabs. Therefore, it is not possible to definitively answer the question based on the provided context."
"Does taking polyunsaturated fatty acids, such as omega-3 and omega-6, reduce ADHD symptoms in children?","['True', 'NEI', 'False']",No,Yes,Yes,"The context suggests that supplementation with omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), specifically eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), may have beneficial effects on behavioral symptoms and cognitive impairments in children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Studies have reported abnormal plasma fatty acid profiles in children with ADHD, and suboptimal omega-3 PUFA levels may contribute to ADHD and related developmental problems. Supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids has been shown to increase EPA and DHA concentrations in erythrocyte membranes and improve working memory function in children with ADHD. Additionally, omega-3 PUFAs may enhance the effects of methylphenidate (MPH), a commonly prescribed medication for ADHD. However, it is currently unclear whether lower long-chain PUFAs are related to ADHD pathology or to associated behaviors. Further research is needed to confirm these findings and determine the optimal dosage and duration of omega-3 PUFA supplementation for children with ADHD."
Does MMS help with an infection with the coronavirus (Covid-19)?,"['NEI', 'False', 'True']",NEI,No,No,"According to the currently available data on the novel coronavirus and clinical features of covid-19, there is no mention of MMS (Miracle Mineral Solution) as a treatment option for an infection with the coronavirus (Covid-19). The discussed treatment options for covid-19 include experimental plasma treatment, antiviral therapy, antimalarial treatment scheme, biological treatment, corticosteroid treatment, symptomatic treatment, and vaccine preparation. Therefore, it can be concluded that MMS does not help with an infection with the coronavirus (Covid-19) based on the current knowledge."
Does ACE inhibitors like ramipril increase the risk of lung cancer?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, including ramipril, has been associated with an increased rate of lung cancer (RR: 1.13; 95% CI: 1.06-1.20). This finding is based on a retrospective cohort study that analyzed the risk of cancer development in patients who received ACE inhibitors/ARBs as treatment for essential hypertension. The study found that regular use of ACE inhibitors/ARBs was not associated with an increased risk of cancer development and was actually found to decrease overall cancer risk. However, the study also noted that additional research is needed to further investigate the potentially increased risk of lung cancer with ACE inhibitors and calcium channel blockers. Therefore, it is important to consider the potential risks and benefits of ACE inhibitors, including ramipril, when making treatment decisions for patients with hypertension."
Does taking vitamin B3 prolong life?,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",NEI,NEI,NEI,"The provided context does not offer a direct correlation between vitamin B3 and longevity. While it is established that vitamin B3 plays a crucial role in maintaining homeostasis and is involved in various pivotal functions, the context does not provide evidence that taking vitamin B3 directly prolongs life. The context primarily focuses on the role of B vitamins, including B3, in preventing cognitive decline, cardiovascular diseases, and dementia. However, the impact of vitamin B3 on overall lifespan is not addressed. Therefore, it is not possible to definitively state that taking vitamin B3 prolongs life based on the given context."
Is there a health risk from metal contaminants in lipsticks?,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",NEI,No,No,"The study conducted in the Malaysian market found no significant non-carcinogenic health risk due to the exposure of heavy metals (lead, cadmium, and chromium) through lipstick consumption for prolonged exposure of 35 years. The study aimed to determine the concentration of these metals in lipsticks of different price categories and evaluate the potential health risks due to daily ingestion. Although the heavy metal content of cosmetics may be a cause for concern, the data suggested that the heavy metals present in cosmetics do not appear to pose a serious risk to health. However, it is important to note that heavy users of lip cosmetics should minimize contamination with some heavy metals, such as lead, manganese, and chromium."
Do saline nasal rinses and nasal sprays or inhaling with steam from saline solution help with colds?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The use of saline nasal rinses and nasal sprays, as well as inhaling steam from saline solution, have been shown to provide benefits for symptom relief with the common cold. The theoretical basis for these treatments is that steam may help congested mucus drain better and heat may destroy the cold virus as it does in vitro. Nasal irrigation with liquid saline is a well-established procedure in the treatment of sinonasal inflammation and infection, and there is evidence that saline is beneficial in the treatment of the symptoms of chronic rhinosinusitis. While less conclusive evidence supports the use of spray and liquid saline nasal irrigation to manage symptoms of mild to moderate allergic rhinitis and acute upper respiratory tract infections, three studies have found benefits of steam for symptom relief with the common cold."
Do over-the-counter cough medicines relieve cough symptoms?,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",NEI,No,No,"According to the limited data that exist, there is no evidence that over-the-counter cough and cold medicines are effective in relieving cough symptoms in children. Three trials found that antihistamines were no more effective than placebo in relieving cough symptoms. In children studies, antitussives, antihistamines, antihistamine decongestants, and antitussive/bronchodilator combinations were no more effective than placebo. The use of over-the-counter cough medicines as an adjunct to antibiotics in children and adults with pneumonia has also not been found to be effective. Pediatricians must weigh the benefits against the potential risks of recommending over-the-counter cough medicines and should be prepared to educate parents about the expected natural course of their child's illness and the likelihood that these medications will be minimally effective in relieving symptoms, if at all."
Does Smartsleep provide better or more restful sleep?,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",NEI,NEI,NEI,"The provided context does not mention Smartsleep, a specific product or method for improving sleep. However, it does discuss the benefits of napping and deep non-rapid eye movement (nrem) sleep, also known as slow-wave sleep (sws), which is thought to be the most ""restorative"" sleep stage. The context mentions that naps in a quiet environment can be rated as more refreshing and restful, and that self-awakening can improve alertness by reducing sleep inertia and alleviating daytime sleepiness heightened by partial sleep deprivation. It also suggests that nrem and rem sleep have distinct and complementary contributions to the overall function of sleep. However, it remains controversial whether napping can provide the same enhancement as overnight sleep. Therefore, without specific information about Smartsleep, it is not possible to determine whether it provides better or more restful sleep."
Does the F.X. Mayr cure have health benefits? Can it prevent diseases or treat them?,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",NEI,NEI,NEI,"The context does not provide information on the F.X. Mayr cure, its health benefits, or its ability to prevent or treat diseases. The context discusses various other plants and their potential therapeutic effects, but it does not mention the F.X. Mayr cure. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether the F.X. Mayr cure has health benefits or can prevent or treat diseases based on the provided context."
Does bioresonance therapy help with health complaints?,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",No,NEI,NEI,"The context provided discusses biofeedback therapy, not bioresonance therapy. Biofeedback and bioresonance are distinct therapeutic approaches. Biofeedback involves the use of electronic monitoring of a normally automatic bodily function in order to train someone to acquire voluntary control of that function. On the other hand, bioresonance is a form of alternative medicine based on the concept that electromagnetic oscillations in the body can be influenced to promote healing. Therefore, the context does not provide sufficient information to determine whether bioresonance therapy helps with health complaints."
"Is wheat lectin, which is found in high amounts especially in whole wheat, harmful to health?","['NEI', 'True', 'False']",No,NEI,NEI,"The provided context does not explicitly mention wheat lectin and its potential health implications. However, it does discuss the adverse effects of wheat proteins, such as gliadin, on human health. These proteins can cause allergic reactions, including baker's asthma, wheat-dependent exercise-induced anaphylaxis, atopic dermatitis, and celiac disease. The context also mentions that wheat can accumulate high levels of cadmium, posing a significant health hazard. Nonetheless, without specific information on wheat lectin, it is not possible to definitively state whether it is harmful to health."
Can injecting stem cells into the knee joint relieve pain and limitations associated with osteoarthritis?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The context suggests that injecting stem cells, specifically mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), into the knee joint has the potential to relieve pain and limitations associated with osteoarthritis. MSCs have been identified as a promising treatment for knee osteoarthritis due to their marked disease-modifying ability and chondrogenic potential. The intra-articular injection of MSCs has been found to be a safe and effective therapeutic alternative for the treatment of severe knee osteoarthritis patients. In preclinical models, MSCs have been shown to significantly reduce pain and repair damaged articular cartilage. Intra-articular injections of MSCs have also been found to decrease inflammation and be a replacement for knee surgery. However, it is important to note that the use of platelet-rich plasma or mesenchymal stem cell therapy to treat knee osteoarthritis cannot be recommended at this time due to the lack of high-quality evidence and the large degree of heterogeneity in study designs and measured outcomes."
Do saw palmetto preparations improve the symptoms of benign enlarged prostate (benign prostatic hyperplasia) in the longer term compared to placebo?,"['False', 'NEI', 'True']",No,No,No,"The evidence from a double-blind trial involving 225 men with moderate-to-severe symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia, who were treated with saw palmetto extract (160 mg twice daily) or placebo for one year, suggests that saw palmetto does not improve symptoms or objective measures of benign prostatic hyperplasia in the longer term compared to placebo. This finding is consistent with recent clinical trials that have questioned the efficacy of saw palmetto at standard doses in treating lower urinary tract symptoms attributed to benign prostatic hyperplasia."
Does taking taiga root extract strengthen the immune system? Can it make vaccinations more effective or tolerable?,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",NEI,NEI,NEI,"The context provided does not mention Taiga root extract, hence it is not possible to definitively state whether it strengthens the immune system or enhances the effectiveness or tolerability of vaccinations. However, the context does indicate that probiotics and adjuvants can stimulate responses to vaccines and enhance the function of the immune system. It also mentions that many probiotics exert anti-inflammatory influence on the immune system and induce T-regs. Therefore, if Taiga root extract has similar properties, it could potentially strengthen the immune system and improve vaccination outcomes. However, this would require further research and evidence."
Does white sugar cause cancer?,"['NEI', 'False', 'True']",NEI,NEI,NEI,"The context suggests that there is a potential association between high sugar intake and increased risk of certain types of cancer, such as colorectal cancer, particularly among smokers and non-alcohol drinkers in men. However, the evidence is not conclusive, and the mechanisms by which sugar may contribute to cancer risk are not fully understood. The context also indicates that there was no association between sugar-sweetened soft drinks and the risk of certain cancers, but an unexpected positive association was observed for consumption of artificially sweetened soft drinks. Therefore, it is not possible to definitively answer whether white sugar causes cancer based on the information provided."
Are Bach flower remedies effective in helping with test anxiety?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",No,Yes,Yes,"The study conducted on the efficacy of Bach flower remedies in subjects with test anxiety revealed that Bach flower remedies are an effective placebo for test anxiety. The use of these remedies has brought about positive emotional changes in the majority of clients in this study. State and trait anxiety scores showed a decrease in posttest study phase in comparison with pretest in all experimental groups. Although three RCTs of BFRs for students with examination anxiety showed no overall benefit in comparison to placebo, the study suggests that Bach flower remedies have the potential to be a therapeutic agent in the relief of anxiety and are worthy of further investigation through robust, purpose-designed studies."
Does ginger work against breast cancer?,"['False', 'True', 'NEI']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The findings suggest that ginger may be a promising candidate for the treatment of breast carcinomas. In vitro studies have shown that ginger treatment suppressed the proliferation and colony formation in breast cancer cell lines, MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231. Ginger treatment downregulated expression of prosurvival genes, such as NF-κB, Bcl-x, Mcl-1, and survivin, and cell cycle-regulating proteins, including cyclin D1 and cyclin-dependent kinase-4 (CDK-4). These results suggest that certain herbs and phytoestrogens, such as ginger, may have potential in the prevention of breast cancer. However, further research is needed to confirm these findings and to determine the optimal dosage and duration of ginger treatment for breast cancer."
Does the Orthopulse device accelerate the orthodontic correction of malocclusions?,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",NEI,NEI,NEI,"The provided context does not contain any information regarding the Orthopulse device and its effects on the orthodontic correction of malocclusions. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer based solely on the given information. Further research and information are required to determine if the Orthopulse device accelerates the orthodontic correction of malocclusions."
Does taking the birth control pill adversely affect mate choice? (Reader inquiry),"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"Justification: The context suggests that the use of birth control pills can alter women's mate preferences, specifically decreasing their preference for male facial masculinity. This change in preference has been shown to influence real-life partner selection, with women who used the pill during mate choice selecting partners with less masculine faces compared to women who did not use hormonal contraception. Therefore, it can be inferred that taking the birth control pill may adversely affect mate choice."
Is whole-body vibration therapy effective in preventing bone fractures in osteoporosis sufferers?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"Justification: The context provides evidence that whole-body vibration (WBV) therapy has been proposed as a potential alternative to bone stimulation for osteoporosis prevention. High-frequency, low-amplitude WBV has been shown to stimulate new bone formation and prevent trabecular bone loss. Animal studies have demonstrated that vibration loading can improve bone mass and mechanical competence, suggesting potential for preventing and treating osteoporosis. In humans, WBV has been shown to reduce bone loss at the hip and spine and improve lower limb muscle function. Furthermore, WBV has been shown to exert a favorable effect on osteoporotic bone, and it may offer a promising route to stimulate bone formation in patients with osteoporosis. Therefore, based on the available evidence, it can be concluded that WBV therapy is effective in preventing bone fractures in osteoporosis sufferers."
Do green-lipped mussel preparations improve the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The context suggests that green-lipped mussel preparations have been studied for their potential anti-inflammatory and anti-arthritic effects. Lipid extracts from hard-shelled mussels (Mytilus coruscus) have shown strong anti-inflammatory activity in arthritis models of rats. In human clinical trials, intake of blue mussels decreased disease activity in women with rheumatoid arthritis. Additionally, the therapeutic benefits of green-lipped mussel (Perna canaliculus) preparations have been studied, and the stabilized lipid extract, Lyprinol, is currently used to relieve symptoms of arthritis. However, it is important to note that the evidence is not entirely consistent, and further investigations are necessary to determine the therapeutic potential of green-lipped mussel supplements in the management of arthritis."
Can acupuncture prevent migraines and tension headaches?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"The evidence from multiple clinical trials and systematic reviews, including a Cochrane review, supports the use of acupuncture as an effective prophylactic measure for patients with frequent or insufficiently controlled migraine attacks. Acupuncture has been shown to significantly decrease both the frequency and intensity of migraines, with the benefits persisting for at least 12 weeks after the final acupuncture session. The specific mechanisms of acupuncture are not yet fully understood, but research suggests that it may involve the inhibition of dural mast cells, macrophages, and serum inflammatory factors. Although the effectiveness of acupuncture for episodic migraine has been confirmed, the mechanisms underlying its specific effect on migraine remain controversial. Acupuncture may also be a suitable choice for menstrual-related migraine when pharmacological prophylaxis is not suitable."
Does excessive beer or alcohol consumption lead to obesity?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The context suggests that excessive beer or alcohol consumption can lead to obesity. Regular consumption of alcohol is regarded as a risk factor for weight gain, increased abdominal obesity, and hypertriglyceridemia. Alcohol intake is associated with overeating in humans, and moderate amounts of alcohol enhance energy intake due to its caloric content and appetite-enhancing effects. Heavy and regular alcohol consumption has been positively correlated with increasing body weight. Although it is still controversial whether moderate amounts of alcohol represent a risk factor for weight gain and obesity, excessive alcohol consumption, including binge drinking, is a common cause of fatty liver disease."
"Does treatment with cyanoacrylate (for example, Sapheon Venaseal™) help against varicose veins as well or better than other methods?","['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The context suggests that cyanoacrylate adhesive embolization and sclerotherapy is an efficacious treatment for primary varicose veins due to great saphenous vein reflux. This method has been reported to result in significant improvement in venous clinical severity scores. Additionally, the use of cyanoacrylate as an embolic agent has been found to be a safe and efficacious innovative technique for the treatment of incompetent truncal veins. Current guidelines recommend injection of cyanoacrylate as first-line therapy to prevent gastric variceal rebleeding. The context also mentions that endovenous cyanoacrylate ablation and laser ablation result in high occlusion rates for the management of incompetent great saphenous veins. Therefore, it can be concluded that treatment with cyanoacrylate, such as Sapheon Venaseal™, can be as effective as other methods for the treatment of varicose veins."
Does marijuana use reduce the risk of developing diabetes?,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",Yes,No,No,"The evidence suggests that marijuana use is associated with an increased risk of prediabetes, but not with the development of diabetes by middle adulthood. Over 18 years of follow-up, a greater risk of prediabetes was found for individuals who reported a lifetime use of marijuana of 100 times or more, compared with individuals who had never used marijuana. After multivariable adjustment, higher odds of prediabetes were found for individuals who reported current use of marijuana and a lifetime use of 100 times or more, compared with individuals who reported never using marijuana. Although epidemiologic studies have found lower prevalence rates of obesity and diabetes mellitus in marijuana users compared with people who have never used marijuana, the relationship between cannabinoids and peripheral metabolic processes is not fully understood. In multivariable adjusted models, current marijuana use was associated with lower fasting insulin levels and lower homa-ir, but this does not necessarily translate to a reduced risk of developing diabetes."
Does the number of deliveries with a vacuum cup and forceps remain similar with induction and observational waiting???,"['NEI', 'False', 'True']",Yes,No,No,"The number of deliveries with a vacuum cup and forceps does not remain similar with induction and observational waiting. The rate of vacuum-assisted deliveries has increased compared to forceps application in the last decade. This is likely due to the vacuum extractor being associated with less maternal morbidity and comparable neonatal problems, while forceps delivery has a lower failure rate. However, the pliable cup used in vacuum-assisted deliveries detaches significantly more often than the rigid cup, leading to a higher rate of failed deliveries. Additionally, there is a relationship between unfavorable cup application during vacuum-assisted delivery and neonatal scalp trauma in infants born to nulliparous women. Therefore, the choice of delivery method depends on various factors, including the mother's and infant's health, the position of the fetus, and the experience of the healthcare provider."
Can spending time at waterfalls on a regular basis provide lasting improvement in asthma symptoms?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The evidence suggests that exposure to the specific microclimate of alpine waterfalls with high levels of ionized water aerosols can trigger beneficial immunological and psychological effects. Water-based exercise has been shown to offer benefits for people with asthma through pollen-free air, humidity, and the effects of exercise on physical function. The study provides new data that strongly support an ""added value"" of exposure to waterfall microclimate when combined with a therapeutic sojourn at high altitude including regular physical activity. Exposure to waterfall revealed an additional benefit concerning psychological parameters such as subjective stress perception, the global severity index, and the positive symptom total. The analysis of the mucosal immune response revealed a waterfall-specific beneficial effect with elevated IGA titers in the waterfall group. Asthmatic subjects had good perception of improvements in lung function. Increased cardiac function by bathing is suggested to contribute to the effect. The study provides strong evidence that prolonged use of inhaled steroids is associated with improvement in airway responsiveness and clinical asthma severity in inhaled steroid-dependent asthma. These results suggest that the breathing exercise by immersion is useful not only in treating emphysema but also in improving cardiac function. Since most asthmatic patients are healthy except for an intermittent respiratory problem, providing them the opportunity to exercise in all weather conditions affords a clear improvement in their quality of life."
Does petroleum help against cancer?,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",NEI,No,No,"The provided context does not suggest that petroleum helps against cancer. In fact, it indicates that petroleum workers, who are exposed to benzene or benzene-containing petroleum products, are not at an increased risk of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) as a result of this exposure. However, this does not imply that petroleum has a protective effect against cancer. The high toxicity and recalcitrant properties of petroleum hydrocarbons are well known, and their increasing presence in the environment due to accidents and leakages has had a significant impact. Therefore, it is inaccurate to claim that petroleum helps against cancer."
"Do dental care products with nanoparticles of hydroxyapatite help pain-sensitive teeth? And can they prevent caries or repair already affected, decayed tooth enamel?","['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The use of dental care products containing nanoparticles of hydroxyapatite has been shown to be effective in reducing tooth sensitivity, as indicated by the significant decrease in dentine permeability (p < 0.05) when the hydroxyapatite paste was applied to dentine. Furthermore, these products have demonstrated efficacy in preventing caries and treating hypersensitivity, as they provide calcium and phosphate ions to dental hard tissues, reducing demineralization and promoting remineralization. The study also found that the addition of hydroxyapatite to toothpaste did not alter its polishing properties, while it did result in a marked increase in tooth whitening. The results of the present research indicate that the nacp-based nanocomposites are promising for restorations to inhibit caries and protect tooth structures."
Can they delay the progression of eye disease?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"Justification: The context suggests that various therapeutic interventions, including antioxidants, anti-inflammatory drugs, and gene therapy, have the potential to delay the progression of eye diseases such as cataracts, glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration, and diabetic retinopathy. These interventions can halt or slow down the pathological processes, prevent or delay vision loss, and improve functional vision. The context also mentions that lowering intraocular pressure can slow glaucoma progression, and that early detection and treatment of eye diseases can prevent irreversible damage. Therefore, it can be inferred that these interventions can delay the progression of eye diseases."
Does the so-called blood group diet have any health benefits?,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",NEI,No,No,"The scientific literature does not currently provide evidence to support the purported health benefits of blood type diets. Although adherence to certain 'blood-type' diets is associated with favorable effects on some cardiometabolic risk factors, these associations were found to be independent of an individual's ABO genotype. This suggests that the observed health benefits are not specifically linked to the ABO blood group system. Furthermore, matching the 'blood-type' diets with the corresponding blood group did not change the effect size of any of these associations. Therefore, the findings do not support the 'blood-type' diet hypothesis."
Can DHEA prolong life or improve health in old age?,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",NEI,NEI,NEI,"The context suggests that DHEA (dehydroepiandrosterone) has been proposed to have a favorable role in successful aging and has gained recognition as a dietary supplement to reduce the symptoms of aging and improve well-being. Several studies have shown that DHEA has promising uses in a large range of age-related illnesses, including osteoporosis, atherosclerosis, immune dysfunctions, and cancer. The collected data indicate that DHEA supplementation to counteract its gradual decrease over age is beneficial. However, the context does not provide conclusive evidence that DHEA can prolong life or improve health in old age. Therefore, it is not possible to definitively answer the question based solely on the provided context."
Can echinacea protect against Sars-CoV-2 infection or help treat covid-19?,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",NEI,NEI,NEI,"Justification: The provided context suggests that echinacea supplementation may decrease the duration and severity of acute respiratory tract infections, and that it may assist with the symptoms of acute respiratory infections and the common cold. However, it is explicitly stated that no studies using echinacea in the prevention or treatment of conditions similar to COVID-19 have been identified. While echinacea has been shown to decrease levels of immune molecules involved in cytokine storm, there is currently no research on the therapeutic effects of echinacea in the management of cytokine storm in the context of COVID-19. Therefore, there is not enough information to definitively conclude that echinacea can protect against SARS-CoV-2 infection or help treat COVID-19."
Does taking vitamin A or following certain diets improve or halt the progression of multiple sclerosis (MS)?,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",NEI,NEI,NEI,"The provided context discusses the role of vitamins and dietary supplements in multiple sclerosis (MS), with a particular emphasis on vitamin D. It mentions that vitamin D status has been shown to influence both the incidence and the course of MS, and that high vitamin D levels are probably protective against the development of MS. The context also suggests that certain dietary regimens, including those with polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and vitamins, might improve outcomes in people with MS. However, the context does not provide specific information on the role of vitamin A in MS. Therefore, it is not possible to definitively state whether taking vitamin A or following certain diets improves or halts the progression of MS based on the provided context."
1. can MMR vaccination cause autism?,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",No,No,No,"The available epidemiological and related evidence does not support a causal association between MMR vaccine and autism. Several studies have found no association between MMR vaccination and autism, including a study that found that MMR vaccine was not associated with an increased risk of autism even among high-risk children whose older siblings had autism. The hypothesis that MMR vaccines cause autism was first raised by reports of cases in which developmental regression occurred soon after MMR vaccination, but this has not been supported by scientific evidence. The belief that there is a link between the MMR vaccine and autism has led to a decline in childhood-immunization uptake and a resurgence of preventable infectious diseases."
Can low-level laser therapy reduce wrist osteoarthritis pain?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",No,Yes,Yes,"Low-level laser therapy (LLLT) has been shown to offer promising symptomatic relief of osteoarthritic (OA) pain, including in the wrist. The review of clinical effectiveness indicates that LLLT reduces pain in patients with OA. LLLT has been used for the treatment of various rheumatologic, neurologic, and musculoskeletal disorders, including OA. Although the laser therapy dose protocol has not been completely established, LLLT has been developed for non-invasive treatment of joint diseases. LLLT is thought to have an analgesic effect and may cause potential beneficial effects. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that LLLT can reduce wrist OA pain."
"Does microimmunotherapy improve symptoms of allergies, cancer, joint inflammation, autoimmune diseases, dementia or various viral infections?","['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The context suggests that immunotherapy, including microimmunotherapy, has been shown to improve symptoms of various conditions. These include allergic diseases, infections, and cancer, as well as autoimmune conditions such as multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and systemic lupus erythematosus. Immunotherapy has the potential to modify or re-balance the immune system, and can be used to treat inflammatory dermatoses, viral infections, and cancers of the skin and genital mucosa. The use of anti-cytokine therapy in rheumatoid arthritis has improved the quality of life of patients with refractory disease. Therapies directed against specific effector molecules, such as immunoglobulin E and prostaglandin D2, hold promise in immune modulation of allergic disease. Topical immunotherapy with both immunostimulatory and immunosuppressive agents bears potential for effective and patient-friendly treatment of inflammatory, infectious, and cancerous skin diseases. Allergen immunotherapy has been shown to be efficacious in numerous studies for the clinical indications of allergic asthma and rhinitis, as well as hymenoptera venom hypersensitivity. However, the context does not mention the use of microimmunotherapy specifically for dementia."
Does the Toxoplasma gondii parasite affect suicide rates?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"Justification: The Toxoplasma gondii parasite has been associated with an increased risk of several psychiatric disorders, including suicidal behavior. Studies have found a positive association between the prevalence of Toxoplasma gondii and national homicide rates, as well as suicide rates. The parasite is known to persist in host tissues, including the brain, and can cause persistent infection in humans. The proposed mechanisms by which Toxoplasma gondii may affect human behavior and mental health are still under investigation, but it is clear that there is a potential causal relationship between the parasite and suicide attempts."
Do heat patches help with lower back pain?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"The evidence suggests that heat therapy, such as heat patches, can provide a small short-term reduction in pain and disability for individuals with acute and sub-acute low-back pain. A trial of 90 participants with acute low-back pain found that a heated blanket significantly decreased pain immediately after application. Additionally, a trial of 100 participants with a mix of acute and sub-acute low-back pain found that the addition of exercise to heat wrap therapy reduced pain after seven days. Furthermore, a randomized controlled trial found that heat delivered via pulses at 45°C provided an analgesic response in subjects with longstanding low back pain. However, the evidence base to support the common practice of superficial heat and cold for low back pain is limited, and there is a need for future higher-quality randomized controlled trials."
Can homeopathic globules protect against infection with the novel coronavirus?,"['NEI', 'False', 'True']",NEI,No,No,"The provided context discusses various strategies for developing vaccines against coronaviruses, influenza viruses, and other pathogens. These strategies involve targeting conserved proteins, using virus-like particles containing hemagglutinin, and investigating the role of glycoproteins in immune evasion. However, there is no mention of homeopathic globules or their potential to protect against infection with the novel coronavirus. Therefore, based on the given context, it cannot be concluded that homeopathic globules can protect against infection with the novel coronavirus."
Can homeopathic remedies prevent colds in children?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",No,No,No,"The provided context does not offer sufficient evidence to support the claim that homeopathic remedies can prevent colds in children. While the context mentions a study that found a homeopathic syrup to be effective in reducing the severity of cold symptoms in young children, it does not suggest that homeopathic remedies can prevent colds. Furthermore, the context emphasizes that there is little evidence to support the efficacy of any therapy for the treatment of common cold symptoms in children under 6 years of age. Therefore, it is unlikely that homeopathic remedies can prevent colds in children."
Can the duration of childbirth be reduced by aromatherapy with lavender oil?,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",NEI,No,No,"The provided context suggests that aromatherapy with lavender oil can be effective in reducing anxiety and pain during childbirth. However, there is no reported evidence of efficacy or risks of aromatherapy oils use for pregnancy-related symptoms or conditions, including the duration of childbirth. Additionally, the study on the oral administration of evening primrose oil from the 37th gestational week until birth found that it does not shorten gestation or decrease the overall length of labor. Therefore, it can be concluded that there is no evidence to support the claim that the duration of childbirth can be reduced by aromatherapy with lavender oil."
Does paxlovid protect unvaccinated people with risk factors from severe or even fatal covid 19 disease?,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",Yes,NEI,NEI,"The context provided does not contain information on Paxlovid, a medication used to treat COVID-19. Therefore, it is not possible to determine if Paxlovid protects unvaccinated people with risk factors from severe or fatal COVID-19 disease based solely on the given context. It is important to note that vaccines and medications such as Paxlovid are different and serve different purposes in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. Vaccines are used to prevent infection and reduce the severity of symptoms, while medications like Paxlovid are used to treat those who have already contracted the virus. Further information is needed to answer the question accurately."
Does staining brain tumors with the dye aminolevulinic acid before surgery help patients survive longer?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The use of five-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) in the staining of malignant glioma cells has significantly improved the intraoperative radicality in the resection of gliomas. This technique has been shown to facilitate a greater extent of resection and improve 6-month progression-free survival in patients with high-grade gliomas. The 5-ALA-induced fluorescence has been used to good effect in increasing the rate of complete resection, and has become a valuable adjunct in the resection of malignant intracranial gliomas. The use of 5-ALA has been recognized to increase the extent of tumor resection, and has been shown to be useful in the resection of certain brain tumors other than high grade gliomas. The 5-ALA technique has made a major advance in surgical neuro-oncology, and has been shown to increase the rate of radical tumor resection. The use of 5-ALA-induced fluorescence-guided surgery has been investigated as a tool for improving resections, and has shown promising results in the resection of malignant gliomas."
Does induction of labor make cesarean sections less necessary than observational waiting?,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",Yes,No,No,"The claim that induction of labor makes cesarean sections less necessary than observational waiting is not supported by the evidence. Although some studies have found that induction of labor at 39 weeks in low-risk nulliparous women reduces the risk of cesarean delivery compared with expectant management, other studies have found that induction of labor is associated with a small increased risk of cesarean delivery. Inappropriate elective inductions of labor can put patients at increased risk of cesarean delivery, neonatal morbidity, and elevated cost. When using the correct comparison group (elective induction vs expectant management), induction is not associated with an increased risk of cesarean delivery. However, the evidence does not support the claim that induction of labor makes cesarean sections less necessary than observational waiting."
Is matcha tea particularly healthy?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The scientific literature suggests that matcha tea has potential health benefits. Matcha tea consumption leads to a higher intake of green tea phytochemicals compared to regular green tea. It is richer in some nutritional elements and epigallocatechin 3-o-gallate than other green teas. The concentration of epigallocatechin gallate (egcg) available from drinking matcha is significantly higher than that available from other green teas. Studies have shown that matcha protects against hepatic and renal damage through the suppression of renal age accumulation, decreases in hepatic glucose, triglyceride, and total cholesterol levels, and its antioxidant activities. However, it is important to note that more studies are needed to fully understand the health benefits of matcha tea."
,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",Yes,NEI,NEI,"The context provided does not contain information regarding the effects of monk's pepper (Vitex agnus-castus) on premenstrual syndrome (PMS) symptoms. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether monk's pepper can reduce PMS symptoms based solely on the given context. Further research and evidence are required to make a definitive conclusion."
Does ginger help with period pain?,"['NEI', 'False', 'True']",Yes,NEI,NEI,"The provided context discusses the effects of ginger on various types of pain, including muscle pain, visceral pain, and pain associated with osteoarthritis and irritable bowel syndrome. However, it does not provide specific information on the effect of ginger on period pain.

Further research is needed to determine the effectiveness of ginger in relieving period pain."
Can turmeric relieve the symptoms of depression?,"['True', 'False', 'NEI']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"Turmeric, a medicinal herb, has been used for centuries to treat various ailments. The principal component of turmeric, curcumin, has been studied for its potential health benefits. While the context provided does not directly address the question of turmeric's effect on depression, there is evidence to suggest that it may have a positive impact.

     Curcumin has been shown to have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, and these properties have been linked to improved mental health. Inflammation and oxidative stress are believed to play a role in the development of depression. Therefore, by reducing inflammation and oxidative stress, curcumin may help alleviate symptoms of depression.

     Furthermore, curcumin has been shown to increase levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a protein that supports the survival and growth of neurons. Low levels of BDNF have been associated with depression.

     However, it is important to note that more research is needed to fully understand the potential benefits of turmeric and curcumin for depression. The available evidence suggests that turmeric may have a role in relieving symptoms of depression, but further studies are required to confirm this."
Can capsules with omega-3 fatty acids from fish oil relieve depression?,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",NEI,No,No,"The evidence from a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial suggests that the addition of fish oil to existing therapy in participants being treated for depression in a community setting did not improve mood when compared to the placebo oil, despite an increase in circulating omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids. This particular dose and type of fish oil conferred no additional benefit to conventional treatment of depression in this sample. While some studies have reported that countries with high rates of fish oil consumption have low rates of depressive disorder, and that omega-3 fatty acids have aetiological importance in depression, the results of this trial do not support the use of fish oil capsules for the relief of depression."
Does dimenhydrinate relieve travel nausea better than a placebo?,"['True', 'False', 'NEI']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"Dimenhydrinate has been shown to be effective in relieving nausea and vomiting in various contexts, including post-operative and pregnancy-related nausea. In a prospective, randomized, double-blind study, more patients in the dimenhydrinate group remained completely free from post-operative nausea and vomiting compared with placebo (dimenhydrinate: 38.8%; placebo: 15.1%; p = 0.004). In another study, diclectin, a delayed-release formulation of doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride, was found to be effective and well-tolerated in treating nausea and vomiting of pregnancy, with a significantly larger improvement in symptoms compared with placebo. While the specific use of dimenhydrinate for travel nausea has not been explicitly evaluated, its demonstrated efficacy in other contexts suggests that it may be effective in relieving travel nausea as well."
Does regular vitamin D intake lower the risk of cancer in adults?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",No,Yes,Yes,"The scientific literature supports the role of vitamin D in reducing the risk of several types of cancer, particularly colorectal cancer. Studies that include vitamin D from all sources or serum 25(OH)D3 usually show significantly reduced incidence of colorectal cancer in association with vitamin D. There is also evidence that higher circulating levels of vitamin D are associated with reduced risk of bladder malignancies and postmenopausal breast cancer. However, the available evidence provides only limited support for an inverse association between vitamin D status and the risk of other types of cancer. The maintenance of a sufficient vitamin D status might be a promising approach for the prevention and/or treatment of cancer."
Does zinc preventively protect against covid-19 disease???,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",NEI,NEI,NEI,"The study provides evidence that a significant number of COVID-19 patients were zinc deficient, and that zinc has potent immunoregulatory and antiviral properties. However, direct evidence to determine if zinc is effective for either prevention or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 is still pending. More randomized studies are needed to evaluate the value of adding zinc to other therapies for COVID-19. Therefore, it is not possible to definitively state that zinc prevents COVID-19 disease."
Does fluoride toothpaste prevent tooth decay?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"The context suggests that fluoride toothpaste is an effective measure in preventing tooth decay. Fluoride serves as a gold standard agent for preventing tooth decay, and its presence in the enamel protects teeth against carious attack. The clinical anticaries efficacy of fluoride toothpaste is well-established, and toothbrushing with fluoride dentifrice has become an important public health measure in preventing caries and gingivitis. The results of the present study suggest that there is considerable salivary fluoride retention after brushing with fluoride dentifrices, indicating that fluoride is retained in the oral cavity and can contribute to enamel remineralization. The study also found that both brushing time and dentifrice quantity may be important determinants of fluoride retention in the oral cavity and consequent enamel remineralization. In conclusion, the results of this study suggest that fluoride toothpaste is an effective measure in preventing tooth decay."
Can switching to a higher fiber diet prevent colorectal cancer?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",No,Yes,Yes,"The evidence suggests that a higher fiber diet, particularly from cereals and fruit, may reduce the risk of incident colorectal adenoma and distal colon cancer. This is supported by the observation of a reduced risk of distal colon cancer with increased total fiber intake (HR: 0.62; 95% CI: 0.41, 0.94; p-trend = 0.03). Additionally, elevated total dietary fiber intake was associated with a significantly reduced risk of incident distal colorectal adenoma (OR: 0.76; 95% CI: 0.63, 0.91; p-trend = 0.003). However, it is important to note that the association was not statistically significant for colorectal cancer overall (HR: 0.85; 95% CI: 0.70, 1.03; p-trend = 0.10). Nevertheless, the evidence suggests that a higher fiber diet may have a protective effect against colorectal cancer, particularly in the early stages of carcinogenesis."
Does high-dose vitamin D slow down the course of disease in multiple sclerosis (MS)?,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",NEI,NEI,NEI,"The context suggests that high-dose vitamin D may have a beneficial effect on the clinical course of multiple sclerosis (MS) and that it has been associated with decreased exacerbation risk in relapsing-remitting MS. However, the therapeutic potential of vitamin D in established MS has not been fully explored, and it is unclear whether vitamin D supplementation improves the clinical course of MS. The context also mentions that observational studies have suggested that vitamin D may reduce inflammation in relapsing-remitting MS, but this has not been clearly confirmed in randomized controlled trials. Therefore, there is not enough information to definitively answer whether high-dose vitamin D slows down the course of disease in MS."
Is the DMPS test suitable to reliably indicate mercury poisoning?,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",NEI,No,No,"The DMPS test is not a reliable indicator of mercury poisoning on its own. While the test can be used to mobilize mercury from the body and decrease urinary mercury concentration to normal levels, a simple rise in chelated mercury excretion over baseline excretion is not a reliable diagnostic indicator of mercury poisoning. The gold standard for diagnosis of mercury poisoning, including low-level chronic exposure, is 24-hour urine for mercury and blood mercury. Other tests for mercury levels are also discussed in the context, such as a sensitive and selective assay for mercury ion in aqueous solution with the dpa-cunps."
Does vitamin B3 protect against severe covid-19 events?,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",NEI,NEI,NEI,"The context provided does not contain information regarding the role of vitamin B3, also known as niacin, in the prevention or treatment of severe COVID-19 events.

"Does ""Detoxic"" work against tapeworms and other parasites? Does ""Detoxic"" help with health complaints?","['NEI', 'True', 'False']",NEI,NEI,NEI,"The context does not provide specific information on the product ""Detoxic"" and its effectiveness against tapeworms and other parasites. However, it is known that detox diets claim to facilitate toxin elimination and weight loss. A handful of clinical studies have shown that commercial detox diets enhance liver detoxification and eliminate persistent organic pollutants from the body. Nevertheless, these studies are hampered by flawed methodologies and small sample sizes. Furthermore, few studies have considered the phenomenon of tapeworm destrobilation when determining effective dosages. In the context of tapeworm infections, species-specific identification is important for public health purposes. Trichuris infestations can be eliminated by the use of mebendazole (vermox), a specific drug which has almost no side effects. The spectrum of immunomodulating molecules produced by tapeworms is not yet well understood. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the effectiveness of ""Detoxic"" against tapeworms and other parasites based on the provided context."
"For knee osteoarthritis, does rubbing DMSO into the knee bring less pain and more mobility than rubbing a placebo?","['NEI', 'True', 'False']",No,NEI,NEI,"The provided context does not include any information regarding the use of DMSO (Dimethyl sulfoxide) for knee osteoarthritis. Therefore, it is not possible to determine if rubbing DMSO into the knee brings less pain and more mobility than rubbing a placebo. Further research and evidence are needed to make a definitive conclusion."
Does the plant pigment beta-carotene protect against cancer?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",No,Yes,Yes,"Beta-carotene, a plant pigment, has been suggested to have a protective role against cancer. This is supported by numerous studies indicating its potential in cancer prevention. Beta-carotene has been shown to reduce the risk of certain cancers, with its ability to modulate the risk of cancer being highlighted in epidemiological studies. The anticancer activity of beta-carotene is thought to be due to its antioxidant properties or its ability to be converted to vitamin A. In vitro studies have reported that beta-carotene inhibits the growth of cancer cells, although the molecular mechanisms behind this are not yet fully understood. However, it is important to note that while a high intake of beta-carotene from dietary sources has been linked to a lower risk of cancer, supplemental beta-carotene has been found to enhance lung cancer incidence and mortality among smokers."
Do preparations with unsaponifiable components of avocado and soybean oils (ASU) help against limitations and pain in osteoarthritis of the hip joint?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",No,Yes,Yes,"The studies suggest that preparations with unsaponifiable components of avocado and soybean oils (ASU) have shown promise in the treatment of osteoarthritis (OA) of the hip joint. ASU components are reported to have a chondroprotective effect, reducing cartilage catabolism and chondrocytic synthesis of inflammatory mediators associated with OA. The anti-inflammatory effects of ASU have been demonstrated in clinical and preclinical studies, and ASU is now used in the clinic to decrease joint inflammation and pain associated with mild to severe OA. The efficacy and safety of ASU in the treatment of patients with symptomatic OA of the hip have been evaluated, and ASU is recommended as an adjuvant treatment for osteoarthritic pain and slow-acting symptomatic treatment of hip and knee OA."
Does taking magnesium salts reduce the frequency and intensity of exercise-induced muscle cramps during sports?,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",NEI,NEI,NEI,"Exercise-associated muscle cramps (EAMCs) are a common issue among physically active individuals, and their prevention is of significant interest. The role of hydration and electrolyte supplementation, including magnesium, in preventing EAMCs is under investigation. While magnesium is essential for optimal sports performance and its status in athletes is monitored, the effect of magnesium salts on the frequency and intensity of exercise-induced muscle cramps remains uncertain. Although some studies suggest that ingestion of transient receptor potential (TRP) channel agonists, including magnesium, may be efficacious in attenuating electrically induced muscle cramps, there is no conclusive evidence to support the claim that taking magnesium salts reduces the frequency and intensity of exercise-induced muscle cramps during sports. Further scientific research is needed to establish the role of magnesium in preventing EAMCs."

Does the balsam apple help against infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)?,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",NEI,NEI,NEI,"The context does not provide information on the effects of balsam apple on HIV infection. While it mentions the anti-HIV activity of betulinic acid, which is found in various medicinal herbs and fruits, it does not specify whether balsam apple is one of them. Additionally, the context focuses on the health benefits of apples and African star apples, but does not mention balsam apple. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether balsam apple has any effect on HIV infection based on the provided context."
Does not wearing bras provide medical benefits?,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",NEI,No,No,"The context provided does not suggest that not wearing bras provides medical benefits. In fact, it indicates that ill-fitting bras and insufficient breast support can lead to musculoskeletal pain and hinder women from participating in physical activity. The study found that 70.3% of the sample reported experiencing bra discomfort during exercise, and 85% of the participants were wearing ill-fitting bras. The study aimed to assess the extent to which exercise-induced breast pain and bra discomfort were reported by women living with breast cancer and whether this breast pain and bra discomfort impeded these women from participating in physical activity. The study found that bra discomfort, particularly bra band tightness, is a barrier to participating in physical activity for women living with a breast cancer diagnosis. Therefore, based on the context provided, not wearing bras does not provide medical benefits, and wearing a well-fitted bra is essential for preventing musculoskeletal pain and enabling women to participate in physical activity."
,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The context suggests that sauna bathing may be linked to several health benefits, including a reduction in the risk of vascular diseases such as high blood pressure, cardiovascular disease, and neurocognitive diseases. Additionally, repeated heat exposure like sauna bathing is suggested to beneficially affect against dementia development. The physiologic effect of the sauna in human beings has been studied extensively, and it has been postulated that regular sauna bathing may improve cardiovascular function via improved endothelium-dependent dilatation, reduced arterial stiffness, modulation of the autonomic nervous system, beneficial changes in circulating lipid profiles, and lowering of systemic blood pressure. Furthermore, sauna bathing frequency was related to a reduced risk of dementia after adjustment for potential sociodemographic, lifestyle, and metabolic risk factors of dementia considered. Therefore, it can be inferred that going to the sauna several times a week may prolong women's lives."
Can homeopathic preparations with Anamirta cocculus help against dizziness?,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",NEI,NEI,NEI,"The context does not provide information on the homeopathic preparations with Anamirta cocculus and its effects on dizziness. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether homeopathic preparations with Anamirta cocculus can help against dizziness. The context mentions various herbal medicines and their traditional uses, but it does not provide any information on the specific use of Anamirta cocculus for treating dizziness. Further research is needed to determine the efficacy of Anamirta cocculus in treating dizziness."
"Can filtering out blue light using blue filter glasses or night mode settings on smartphone, tablet or laptop screens have a beneficial effect on sleep?","['True', 'NEI', 'False']",No,Yes,Yes,"Justification: The evidence suggests that exposure to blue light, particularly from electronic devices, can negatively impact sleep by suppressing melatonin and causing neurophysiologic arousal. The use of blue-light filtering spectacle lenses or night mode settings on electronic devices has been shown to improve sleep quality in individuals with insomnia and delayed sleep phase disorder. These interventions can partially filter high-energy short-wavelength light without substantially degrading visual performance. Furthermore, wearing blue-blocking glasses in the evening has been associated with improved sleep and mood in patients with major depressive disorder. Therefore, it can be concluded that filtering out blue light using blue filter glasses or night mode settings on smartphone, tablet, or laptop screens can have a beneficial effect on sleep."

The context discusses the importance of water quality in promoting public health, highlighting the roles of water as a disease vector and a health mediator. It also mentions the potential health risks associated with contaminated bottled water and the benefits of certain types of natural water, such as Jeju groundwater, in reducing allergic inflammation. However, without specific information on Grander water, it is not possible to determine whether it has health benefits compared to untreated drinking water. Further research is needed to evaluate the potential health benefits of Grander water."
Is calcium from Japanese coral safe and effective in preventing disease?,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",NEI,NEI,NEI,"The context suggests that calcium from Japanese coral may have potential benefits for bone health, as it has been found to prevent ovariectomy-induced bone loss and protect bone to a lesser extent in the proximal tibia and lumbar vertebrae. However, the context does not provide enough information to conclude that calcium from Japanese coral is safe and effective in preventing disease. While the context mentions that calcium is necessary for the prevention and treatment of diseases such as osteoporosis, hypertension, and possibly colon cancer, it also notes that the published data so far suggest a potential detrimental effect of calcium supplement on cardiovascular health. Furthermore, the context does not provide any information on the safety of calcium from Japanese coral specifically. Therefore, it is not possible to make a definitive conclusion based on the information provided in the context."
,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"Justification: Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has shown promise in the treatment of Crohn's disease (CD), although the data is limited compared to its use in ulcerative colitis. FMT aims to restore dysbiosis by transferring stool from a healthy donor into the patient. Studies have reported significant improvements in disease activity index and serum albumin concentrations in patients with Crohn's colitis following faecal diversion. FMT has also been used as a rescue therapy for refractory inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including CD. However, concerns remain regarding efficacy and safety in IBD patients, as well as the longitudinal stability of donor stool composition. Further research is needed to establish the role of FMT in the management of CD."
Do health benefits increase with duration and intensity of exercise?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"The context suggests that a higher duration and intensity of exercise can augment the beneficial effects on cardiovascular health and metabolism. Many exercise-related health benefits exhibit a dose-response relationship, meaning that up to a certain point, more exercise is more beneficial. Increasing exercise duration and intensity beyond current recommendations can impart additional cardiovascular benefits. Different exercise intensities may provide distinct health benefits, independent of energy expenditure. Exercise training with low-volume but high-intensity has been suggested as a time-efficient means to achieve health benefits. Habitual physical activity and regular exercise training improve cardiovascular health and longevity. The requisite beneficial amount of activity is that which engenders improved cardiorespiratory fitness, strength, power, and balance. An abundance of epidemiological research confirms the benefits of physical activity in reducing the risk of various age-related morbidities and all-cause mortality."
Can the proper use of fluoride toothpaste cause serious long-term health problems?,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",NEI,No,No,"The proper use of fluoride toothpaste, which involves using a pea-sized amount and spitting it out after brushing, is not associated with serious long-term health problems. The concentration of fluoride in toothpaste is generally considered safe for preventing dental caries. However, excessive intake of fluoride, such as swallowing large amounts of toothpaste or using it inappropriately, can lead to dental, skeletal, and soft tissue fluorosis. Chronic excessive fluoride exposure can impair human health and cause harmful effects on embryonic development. Therefore, it is essential to use fluoride toothpaste as directed and supervise young children during brushing to prevent accidental ingestion."
Does chocolate have a mood-lifting effect?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"The context suggests that chocolate has been shown to have a mood-lifting effect, particularly in improving negative mood states. This effect is thought to be due to the palatability of chocolate, as well as its interactions with neurotransmitters that contribute to mood modulation and appetite regulation. However, the relationship between chocolate and mood is complex and may also be influenced by factors such as emotional eating and the satisfaction of cravings. Further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms behind chocolate's mood-altering properties."
Does osteopathy work?,"['True', 'False', 'NEI']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"There is growing evidence that osteopathy is effective in a range of clinical conditions, including pain and function in the musculoskeletal system, organs, and the head region, as well as functional somatic syndromes. Osteopathic medicine is based on a diagnostic and therapeutic system to treat tissue mobility/motility dysfunctions using different approaches known as osteopathic manipulative treatment. Osteopathic manipulative therapy has been reported to relieve a variety of conditions, and osteopathic manipulative therapy (manipulative care provided by foreign-trained osteopaths) is effective in managing pain caused by a variety of clinical conditions. However, more research is needed to fully understand the underlying biological basis of its therapeutic effects and to establish its cost-effectiveness compared with other treatment modalities."
Does the dietary supplement MSM help with osteoarthritis?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"Methylsulfonylmethane (MSM) has been shown to have beneficial effects on osteoarthritis, particularly in improving joint function, relieving symptoms of joint degeneration, and improving the quality of life in aging populations. In a study, patients with knee osteoarthritis who took MSM for 12 weeks showed an improvement in pain and physical function compared to those who received a placebo. MSM is believed to decrease inflammation in joints and fasten recovery in osteoarthritis, gastric mucosal injury, or obesity-related disorders. It has been used as a dietary supplement for its anti-inflammatory and antioxidative properties. However, the benefits and safety of MSM in managing osteoarthritis and long-term use cannot be confirmed from this pilot trial, and further research is needed to establish its clinical application."
Do rising temperatures and CO2 levels increase the risk of pollen allergy?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"Rising temperatures and CO2 levels have been shown to increase the risk of pollen allergy. The fertilizing effects of carbon dioxide, along with increased temperatures from climate change, lead to an increase in pollen production and the allergen content of pollen grains. This results in a higher concentration of pollen in the air, which can exacerbate symptoms for those with pollen allergies. Furthermore, warmer temperatures can alter the seasonality and concentration of pollen, potentially impacting allergic diseases such as hay fever. The changing global climate and increased pollution also contribute to the release of pollen, thereby increasing the number of people suffering from allergies. Longer pollen seasons increase the duration of exposure, leading to more sensitization, and higher pollen concentrations may result in more severe symptoms. Therefore, it is important to understand the relationship between climate change and pollen allergenicity in order to mitigate the impact of pollen allergies on public health."
Can perineal massage during pregnancy help prevent birth injury in first-time mothers?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"The evidence suggests that antenatal perineal massage is associated with a lower risk of severe perineal trauma and postpartum complications. Women who received antenatal perineal massage had significantly lower incidence of episiotomies and perineal tears, particularly third- and fourth-degree perineal tears. Antenatal perineal massage was also found to significantly affect postnatal perineal pain scores. The technique has been shown to reduce the incidence of perineal tears in primiparous women and is generally well accepted by women."
"Can the Wim Hof method - consisting of breathing training, meditation and acclimatization to cold - strengthen the immune system of healthy people and thus prevent infectious diseases?","['NEI', 'True', 'False']",NEI,NEI,NEI,"The Wim Hof method, which includes breathing training, meditation, and acclimatization to cold, has been suggested to potentially strengthen the immune system and prevent infectious diseases. However, the provided context does not offer direct evidence to support this claim. The context discusses the benefits of hormesis, heat acclimation, and whole-body hyperthermia in improving endurance, thermoregulation, and immune system activation in cancer patients. It also mentions the potential of cold therapy, such as whole-body cryotherapy, to enhance recovery after exercise and accelerate rehabilitation after injury. However, the context does not provide specific information on the Wim Hof method or its effects on the immune system of healthy individuals. Therefore, based on the given context, there is not enough information to definitively answer whether the Wim Hof method can strengthen the immune system of healthy people and prevent infectious diseases."
Does caffeine make us die sooner???,"['True', 'False', 'NEI']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"Justification: The context indicates that caffeine, in severe cases of intoxication, can lead to a lethal outcome. It has been reported to cause profound toxicity, resulting in various symptoms such as tachycardia, arrhythmia, convulsions, vomiting, coma, and potentially death. The case of a 44-year-old woman who was found dead due to fatal arrhythmia caused by an extremely high blood concentration of caffeine further supports this. Although fatalities due to caffeine intoxication are uncommon, the context suggests that excessive consumption can indeed lead to premature death."
Does denosumab (Prolia) reduce the risk of vertebral fractures in osteoporosis?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"Justification: Denosumab has been shown to significantly reduce the risk of new vertebral fractures in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis, as evidenced by multiple randomized controlled trials. The Freedom trial demonstrated that denosumab reduced bone resorption, increased bone mineral density, and decreased the risk of new vertebral, hip, and nonvertebral fractures in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. Compared to placebo, denosumab significantly reduced the risk of new vertebral fractures in women with multiple and/or severe prevalent vertebral fractures. Denosumab is an approved therapy for postmenopausal women with osteoporosis at high or increased risk for fracture, and has been shown to be an efficacious and safe osteoporosis treatment option with sustained fracture risk reduction."
Can acoustic CR ® neuromodulation according to Tass help with tinnitus?,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The evidence suggests that acoustic CR neuromodulation, as proposed by Tass, may have positive effects on tinnitus symptoms. This method is based on CR neuromodulation, which has been shown to be an effective treatment for chronic tonal tinnitus. The main findings in the included studies were that acoustic CR neuromodulation was safe and well tolerated, and most patients reported a reduction of tinnitus symptoms. The results suggest that HTA-CR neuromodulation might be at least comparable to standard CR neuromodulation, providing another effective therapeutic option for the treatment of chronic tonal tinnitus."
Does a lower salt diet reduce the likelihood of cardiovascular disease?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"The evidence suggests that a lower salt diet can reduce the likelihood of cardiovascular disease. A reduction in dietary sodium not only decreases blood pressure and the incidence of hypertension but is also associated with a reduction in morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular diseases. A modest reduction in salt intake causes significant falls in blood pressure in all ethnic groups. Salt reduction may also reduce other cardiovascular risk factors, such as urinary albumin excretion and arterial stiffness. The incidence rate of cardiovascular disease was reduced for those who reduced their sodium intake. In chronic kidney disease patients, a low salt diet is warranted, as it is an established intervention in the treatment of impaired renal function and hypertension, which may modulate cardiovascular risk independent of recognized antihypertensive effects. Prolonged modest reduction in salt intake induces a relevant fall in blood pressure in both hypertensive and normotensive individuals, irrespective of sex and ethnic group, with larger falls in systolic blood pressure for larger reductions in dietary salt."
Does taking vitamin D supplements during pregnancy increase the risk of food allergy for the unborn child?,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",NEI,No,No,"The evidence suggests that maternal vitamin D intake during pregnancy is not associated with an increased risk of food allergy in offspring. In fact, reduced vitamin D status in pregnancy may be a risk factor for the development of allergic outcomes in offspring. Inclusion of foods containing vitamin D in maternal diets during pregnancy may have beneficial effects on childhood allergic rhinitis. The combined role of prenatal and postnatal vitamin D status in the development of food sensitization and food allergy remains understudied, but prenatal and early postnatal vitamin D levels, along with individual genetic susceptibility, should be considered in assessing the role of vitamin D in the development of food sensitization and food allergy. The aim of a study was to investigate the effect of early infancy vitamin D supplementation on allergic disease outcomes in infants at ""hereditary risk"" of allergic disease, but who had sufficient vitamin D levels at birth. The study found that vitamin D intake in pregnancy or by the child in early life did not predict later celiac disease. Therefore, taking vitamin D supplements during pregnancy does not appear to increase the risk of food allergy for the unborn child."
,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",No,No,No,"The risk of food allergy does not decrease if babies are fed potentially allergenic foods as late as possible for the first time. In fact, recent findings suggest that early exposure to dietary antigens, including potentially allergenic foods such as cow's milk, peanuts, and chicken eggs, may be more protective towards allergy than a later introduction. This is supported by research indicating that early introduction of allergenic solid foods, especially peanut and hen's egg, reduces the risk of food allergy development in early childhood. Furthermore, there is no evidence that delaying the introduction of any specific food beyond 6 months of age helps to prevent allergy. On the contrary, exposure to cow's milk protein in the first 3 months of life has been associated with a reduced risk of cow's milk allergy. Therefore, the conventional wisdom that early exposure to allergenic food proteins during pregnancy, lactation, or infancy leads to food allergies is not supported by recent research."
Does plant or animal protein have an influence on lifespan?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"The context suggests that both the level and source of dietary protein can influence lifespan. Optimal lifespan requires a balance of high carbohydrate and low protein consumption, and the ratio of protein to carbohydrate in the diet can affect longevity. Proteins from plant-based sources may have different effects on cardiovascular disease risk factors compared to animal-based sources. The level of dietary protein also influences life-history traits and fitness, including the onset of reproduction and offspring growth and maturation. Furthermore, oxidatively modified proteins have been shown to correlate with the age of an organism or its tissues. Therefore, it can be inferred that both the level and source of dietary protein can have an influence on lifespan."
,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",NEI,NEI,NEI,"The context does not provide direct evidence on the antifungal properties of grapefruit seed extract against diseases such as athlete's foot or nail fungus. However, it does mention that grapefruit juice has higher total phenol and flavonoid contents than shaddock juice, and both juices inhibit ACE activity in a dose-dependent manner. Additionally, the context suggests that resveratrol, a compound found in grapes, could be employed as a therapeutic agent to treat fungal infections of humans. Nevertheless, the context does not provide sufficient information to conclude that grapefruit seed extract is effective against athlete's foot or nail fungus."
Does frequent consumption of potatoes increase the risk of dying from cancer?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",No,Yes,Yes,"The frequent consumption of potatoes, particularly fried potatoes, has been associated with an increased mortality risk. Epidemiological studies suggest that consumption of potatoes is linked to an increased risk of cardiometabolic diseases, including colorectal cancer (CRC). High potato consumption, defined as ≥3 potatoes per day, was found to be associated with a higher risk of CRC compared to consuming 0-7 potatoes per week. Additionally, consuming fried potatoes 2-3 times per week or ≥3 times per week was associated with an increased risk of mortality. However, the association between potato consumption and the risk of pancreatic cancer was not consistently observed."
Does hypnosis help with chronic bowel problems?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"Hypnotherapy has been shown to be an effective intervention for the treatment of functional bowel disorders, particularly irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Recent controlled studies have demonstrated the unequivocal benefits of hypnotherapy in conditions such as IBS and peptic ulceration. The therapeutic effect of hypnotherapy has been found to be superior to that of a waiting list control or usual medical management for abdominal pain and composite primary IBS symptoms in the short term in patients who fail standard medical therapy. Gut-directed hypnotherapy has been reported to have durable efficacy in patients with IBS and possibly ulcerative colitis. Although there are some methodologic inadequacies, all studies show that hypnotherapy is highly effective for patients with refractory IBS. However, the definite efficacy of hypnosis in the treatment of IBS remains unclear due to a lack of controlled trials supporting this finding."
"In everyday life, when breathing with an FFP2 mask or ordinary mouth-nose protection, do you get as much oxygen as without a mask?","['True', 'NEI', 'False']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"The provided context discusses various oxygen delivery systems, including face masks and nasal cannulas, and their impact on oxygenation. While the context does not directly address the use of FFP2 masks or ordinary mouth-nose protection, it does provide insight into the general principles of oxygen delivery and mask usage.

     The context suggests that the efficiency of oxygen delivery is dependent on the type of mask used and the flow rate of oxygen. However, it is important to note that the masks discussed in the context are primarily used in medical settings for patients with respiratory insufficiency, and their purpose is to increase the concentration of oxygen delivered to the patient.

     In the context of everyday life, FFP2 masks and ordinary mouth-nose protection are not designed to increase the concentration of oxygen delivered to the wearer. Instead, they are primarily used to prevent the spread of respiratory droplets and protect the wearer from inhaling harmful particles.

     Therefore, when breathing with an FFP2 mask or ordinary mouth-nose protection in everyday life, the wearer should receive as much oxygen as without a mask, as these masks do not significantly impede the wearer's ability to breathe in and exhale air. This is supported by clinical observations that report greater patient acceptance and comfort versus oxygen masks, as well as the fact that FFP2 masks and ordinary mouth-nose protection are widely used in various settings without causing significant respiratory distress in healthy individuals."
"Do products with talc, such as baby powder, increase the risk of ovarian cancer?","['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The context suggests that there is a positive association between perineal use of talc powder and ovarian cancer. Epidemiological observations indicate that perineal use of talc powder is associated with an increased risk of ovarian cancer, particularly in a milieu with higher estrogen. Genital talc use has been associated with increased risk for ovarian carcinoma in epidemiologic studies, and several studies have reported a positive association between perineal use of talcum powder among adult women and ovarian cancer risk. Although there is no proof that talc used externally reaches the pelvis, vaginal exposures to talc and other particulates may play an etiologic role in epithelial ovarian cancer. Therefore, it can be inferred that products with talc, such as baby powder, may increase the risk of ovarian cancer."
Does taking vitamin K lower the risk of other bone fractures in older women?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"The evidence from several epidemiologic and intervention studies suggests that vitamin K deficiency is associated with reductions in bone mineral density and an increased risk of fractures. In postmenopausal women with osteoporosis, vitamin K2 has been shown to play a role in maintaining bone mineral density and reducing the incidence of fractures. Furthermore, lifetime supplementation with vitamin K, vitamin D(3), and calcium is likely to reduce fractures and increase survival in postmenopausal women. Despite the lack of a significant change or the occurrence of only a modest increase in bone mineral density, high-dose vitamin K(1) and vitamin K(2) supplementation has been shown to improve indices of bone strength and reduce the incidence of clinical fractures. However, the effect of vitamin K on the skeleton remains a matter of controversy, and there is no clear evidence-based universal recommendation for its use."
Does kombucha have a positive effect on health?,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"Kombucha, a tea drink with high antioxidant potential, has been associated with various health benefits. It is obtained through the activity of a consortium of acetic acid bacteria and osmophilic yeast, also known as ""tea fungus."" The consumption of kombucha fermented tea (kt) has been linked to health prophylaxis and recovery due to its properties of detoxification, antioxidation, energizing potencies, and promotion of depressed immunity. The recent experimental studies on the consumption of kt suggest that it is suitable for prevention against broad-spectrum metabolic and infective disorders. Producers claim that kombucha bears health-enhancing properties that may come from the tea or metabolites produced by its microbiome. However, it is noted that very little scientific evidence is available that validates the beneficial effects of kt."
,"['True', 'False', 'NEI']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The context suggests that cannabis may have a positive impact on symptoms of Parkinson's disease, including movement disorders. A study of 22 patients with Parkinson's disease found that the mean (SD) total score on the motor unified Parkinson's disease rating scale improved significantly from 33.1 (13.8) at baseline to 23.2 (10.5) after cannabis consumption (t = 5.9; p < 0.001). The study suggests that cannabis might have a place in the therapeutic armamentarium of Parkinson's disease. However, further studies are needed to establish the long-term benefits and consequences of cannabis use in people with Parkinson's disease."
Does propolis have a healing or soothing effect on inflammation in the mouth (in otherwise healthy people)?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"Propolis, a natural resinous substance produced by bees, has been shown to have anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory activities. Its traditional use in maintaining oral cavity and upper respiratory tract health is attributed to its antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties. Studies have indicated that propolis can be effective in managing oral mucositis, a condition characterized by inflammation in the mouth. Its use has been associated with the alleviation of oral mucositis and dysphagia in patients undergoing head and neck radiotherapy. Furthermore, propolis has been shown to suppress the expression of IL-6, a pro-inflammatory cytokine, on inflamed rat dental pulp tissue. These findings suggest that propolis may have a healing or soothing effect on inflammation in the mouth, even in otherwise healthy individuals. However, more research is needed to fully understand its potential benefits and mechanisms of action."
Does regular use of sleeping pills promote the risk of death or cancer?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"The context suggests that regular use of sleeping pills is associated with an increased risk of death and cancer. Multiple studies have found that habitual sleeping pill usage is related to death from cancer, and sedative drug use is associated with a significant increase in mortality risk. The most important risks of hypnotics include excess mortality, infections, cancer, and other undesirable outcomes. The high prevalence of sleeping medication use in older cohorts is a significant public health concern. The context also indicates that poor subjective sleep quality is associated with increased risk for death by suicide, and shorter duration of sleep significantly increases the risk of colorectal adenomas."
Do blueberries improve blood sugar levels in type 2 diabetes or do they prevent secondary diseases?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The consumption of blueberries has been shown to have potential beneficial health effects in populations with type 2 diabetes. Blueberries have been demonstrated to improve insulin sensitivity and endothelial function in obese and pre-diabetic humans, as well as decrease oxidative stress and inflammation. Furthermore, blueberry dietary interventions have shown remarkable potential against obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus. In a study, consumption of 22g freeze-dried blueberries for 8 weeks may beneficially affect cardiometabolic health parameters in men with type 2 diabetes. Additionally, blueberries have been shown to improve insulin resistance in obese and insulin-resistant rodents or humans. Therefore, it can be inferred that blueberries may improve blood sugar levels in type 2 diabetes and prevent secondary diseases."
"Does aloe vera help with neurodermatitis, poorly healing or fresh wounds?","['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"Aloe vera has been shown to have beneficial effects on wound healing, both in animal studies and in human trials. Its anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and wound healing properties have been traditionally used to treat skin injuries such as burns, cuts, and eczemas. Aloe vera gel and cape aloe extract have been found to significantly improve wound healing in human primary epidermal keratinocytes and a human skin equivalent model. However, more studies are needed to fully understand the cellular mechanisms of aloe vera's wound healing effects. While there is currently an absence of high-quality clinical trial evidence to support the use of aloe vera topical agents or dressings for the treatment of acute and chronic wounds, its traditional use for the topical treatment of wounds and burns suggests its potential value in treating poorly healing or fresh wounds."
"Is the Gynefix® contraceptive necklace as effective for contraception as the birth control pill or the ""IUD""?","['NEI', 'True', 'False']",Yes,NEI,NEI,"The provided context does not include information on the Gynefix® contraceptive necklace, making it impossible to directly compare its efficacy to that of the birth control pill or the IUD. However, the context does provide information on the high efficacy of both copper-containing and hormonal IUDs as long-acting, reversible contraceptive methods. The copper IUD is noted as the most effective form of emergency contraception and a highly effective, reversible, long-acting, hormone-free method for women with a history of hormonally mediated cancer. The levonorgestrel-releasing IUD is also highly effective, with the potential to reduce the rate of pelvic inflammatory disease and ectopic pregnancy compared to other copper-releasing IUDs. Both types of IUDs are widely used and considered safe and effective forms of contraception."
Are plastic kitchen boards more hygienic than wooden ones?,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",NEI,No,No,"The study indicates that plastic cutting boards are not more hygienic than wooden ones. Although plastic surfaces were consistently cleaner than wood surfaces, fewer bacteria were generally recovered from wooden blocks than from plastic blocks. This suggests that wood surfaces can absorb moisture and in effect absorb contaminating bacteria, making this material less desirable from a food safety perspective. However, new plastic cutting surfaces were relatively easy to clean and were microbiologically neutral. Nevertheless, plastic boards with extensive knife scars were difficult to clean manually, especially if they had deposits of chicken fat on them. Furthermore, the study indicates that brief ""cooking"" of wooden boards at a ""high"" setting in a microwave oven is an effective way to kill bacteria, and thus a very simple and cheap method to protect food against cross-contaminating pathogens."
Can olive leaf extract reduce high blood pressure?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The scientific literature indicates that olive leaf extract has been shown to have a positive impact on cardiovascular disease risk factors, including high blood pressure. The blood pressure-lowering effect of olive is thought to be mediated through calcium channel blockade, which justifies its use in hypertension. Furthermore, sustained treatment with extra virgin olive oil, enriched in bioactive compounds from the olive fruit and leaves, has been suggested as an effective tool for reducing blood pressure and cholesterol levels, either alone or in combination with pharmacological anti-hypertensive treatment. The olive leaf is also considered an important traditional herbal medicine for the treatment of hypertension. Therefore, based on the available evidence, it can be concluded that olive leaf extract may be effective in reducing high blood pressure."
Does taking fish oil with omega-3 fatty acids improve the symptoms of various forms of psoriasis more than a placebo???,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",No,No,No,"The evidence suggests that fish oil supplementation may not significantly improve the symptoms of various forms of psoriasis more than a placebo. A study with 18 patients with stable, plaque psoriasis found no significant reduction in the severity of psoriasis when assessed by the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index score. Additionally, monotherapy with fish oil or omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids had no effect on the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index score, lesion area, or pruritus. However, a patient with generalized pustular psoriasis showed marked improvement with the fish oil supplementation. Overall, the effect of fish oil and its components on psoriasis and its comorbidities remains inconclusive."
Does putting onion bags help with acute otitis media?,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",NEI,NEI,NEI,"The provided context does not contain information regarding the use of onion bags for the treatment of acute otitis media. The context discusses various aspects of acute otitis media, including its prevalence, symptoms, and treatment options such as ventilation tube insertion, antibiotic therapy, and the use of intranasal surfactant. However, there is no mention of onion bags as a treatment or preventive measure for acute otitis media. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer based on the given context."
Do Blushwood berries help against skin cancer?,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",NEI,NEI,NEI,"The context provided does not specifically mention the effects of Blushwood berries on skin cancer. However, it does suggest that various berries and their extracts possess properties that make them important in the prevention of cancer. These berry constituents have been proven to have cancer preventive actions on chemically induced tumors in vivo and cancer suppressive effects in in vitro studies. The literature, including human studies, suggests that berry components can modulate our immune system to delay cancer development. The anticancer effects of berry bioactives are partially mediated through their abilities to counteract, reduce, and also repair damage resulting from oxidative stress and inflammation. The anticancer potential of berries has been related to a multitude of bioactive phytochemicals that these colorful fruits contain. However, the specific molecular mechanisms underlying their anti-cancer effects are largely unknown. Therefore, without specific information on Blushwood berries, it is not possible to definitively state whether they help against skin cancer."
Does covid vaccination reduce the likelihood of getting long-lasting symptoms (long covid) in case of corona infection?,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",Yes,NEI,NEI,"Justification: The context does not provide information on the specific impact of COVID-19 vaccination on the likelihood of developing long-lasting symptoms, often referred to as ""long COVID"". While the context discusses the potential benefits of vaccination in attenuating symptom intensity and inducing an effective immune response, it does not address the duration of symptoms post-infection in vaccinated individuals. Therefore, it is not possible to definitively state whether COVID-19 vaccination reduces the likelihood of long-lasting symptoms based on the provided context."
Can music therapy help people affected by stroke learn to walk normally again?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"Evidence suggests that music-supported therapy (MST) can be a feasible intervention for patients with acute stroke, improving motor, cognitive, and psychosocial functions. In line with this, musical rhythmicity has been observed to improve post-stroke gait. Individualized in-patient rehabilitation interventions that rhythmically pair patient-selected music with rehabilitative interventions have been shown to improve balance and gait in patients with stroke. Furthermore, music-based therapy for rehabilitation has been found to induce neuromodulation at the brain level and improve functional recovery. Arrhythmic music listening has been shown to modulate spinal excitability during post-stroke walking, restoring the CPQ reflex activity to normality. Therefore, it can be concluded that music therapy can help people affected by stroke learn to walk normally again."
Are there effective alternatives to the breathing mask (CPAP) for sleep apnea?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",No,Yes,Yes,"Justification: Several alternatives to CPAP have been proposed for the treatment of sleep apnea. Adaptive servoventilation (ASV) has been found to be more effective than CPAP in relieving complex sleep apnea syndrome. Additionally, drug therapy has been proposed as an alternative to CPAP in some patients with mild to moderate sleep apnea. Oral appliances are also an alternative to CPAP for the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea. However, the effectiveness of these alternatives may vary depending on the severity and type of sleep apnea, and further research is needed to determine their long-term efficacy and safety."
Do azo food dyes cause attention deficit disorder and hyperactivity in children?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"The available evidence supports the hypothesis that azo food dyes, a type of artificial food coloring, can contribute to behavioral changes in children, including hyperactivity. A meta-analysis of 15 double-blind clinical trials showed an increase in hyperactive behavior in children already considered to be hyperactive when exposed to artificial food colorings. Additionally, a placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover clinical study in 297 children representative of the general population showed higher hyperactivity scores during the periods when they were ingesting food colorings. Although the mechanism underlying this phenomenon has not been fully elucidated, it is best to avoid exposing children to artificial food coloring."
Can the active ingredient acetyl salicylic acid (ASA) protect against cancer?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"The context suggests that acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) has been shown to have a protective effect against the incidence and mortality of colorectal cancer. It is also known to serve as an apoptotic agent on cancer cells through the inhibition of the COX-2 enzyme. Furthermore, ASA has been shown to have therapeutic benefits in several types of cancer, including esophageal adenocarcinoma and melanoma. The potential anticancer effects of ASA may be mediated by its ability to suppress prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production and activate 5'-adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK). However, the mechanism by which ASA acts to protect against human cancer is not yet fully understood."
Does frankincense help with painful joint wear (osteoarthritis)?,"['NEI', 'False', 'True']",Yes,NEI,NEI,"The provided context does not contain information regarding the use of frankincense for treating osteoarthritis. Therefore, it is not possible to determine if frankincense is effective in relieving joint pain and improving function in chronic osteoarthritis based on the given information. However, the context does provide evidence for the effectiveness of other treatments such as hyaluronan, a biomechanical approach, topical creams, and exercise therapy in improving joint function and reducing pain in osteoarthritis patients."
"Do large portions, large plates or glasses, and larger packaging cause us to eat and drink more?","['True', 'NEI', 'False']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"Justification: The context indicates that larger portion sizes of foods and beverages lead to increased energy intake and consumption. This is supported by the ""portion size effect,"" where individuals consume more food when served larger portions. The size of the container, such as plates and glasses, also plays a role in food consumption, with larger containers leading to increased intake. Additionally, the context suggests that portion distortion, or perceiving large portion sizes as appropriate, contributes to increased energy intakes and expanding waistlines. Therefore, it can be concluded that large portions, large plates or glasses, and larger packaging do cause us to eat and drink more."
Can taking chlorophyll affect the odor of urine in catheter wearers or stool in people with an artificial bowel outlet?,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",No,NEI,NEI,"The provided context does not contain information regarding the effects of chlorophyll consumption on the odor of urine in catheter wearers or stool in people with an artificial bowel outlet. The context discusses various studies related to chlorine, chlorite, chloroform, and cranberry products, as well as their potential effects on the urinary system. However, there is no mention of chlorophyll or its potential impact on urine or stool odor. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer based on the given context. Further research is required to determine whether taking chlorophyll can affect the odor of urine in catheter wearers or stool in people with an artificial bowel outlet."
Does closure of the foramen ovale prevent further strokes in people who have had a stroke of unknown cause?,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",Yes,NEI,NEI,"The efficacy of closure of a patent foramen ovale (PFO) in the prevention of recurrent stroke after cryptogenic stroke is uncertain. While PFO closure may prevent recurrent stroke in patients aged 60 years or younger, the effect of foramen ovale closure on the risk for subsequent strokes is unknown. In the primary intention-to-treat analysis, there was no significant benefit associated with closure of a PFO in adults who had had a cryptogenic ischemic stroke. However, collaboration between investigators has yielded a database with sufficient power to identify those patients at highest risk for a PFO-related stroke recurrence who may have the greatest potential benefit from PFO closure. Transcatheter closure of a PFO can be accomplished with little morbidity and may reduce the risk of recurrence. However, the available research results do not conclusively suggest a causal relationship between PFO and stroke. Therefore, the question of whether closure of the foramen ovale prevents further strokes in people who have had a stroke of unknown cause remains unresolved."
Does heat treatment (radiofrequency ablation or radiofrequency heat ablation of benign nodules of the thyroid gland work as well as conventional surgical methods?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and laser ablation are thermal ablation techniques that have been shown to be effective in treating benign thyroid nodules. These minimally invasive techniques have been gradually acknowledged as alternatives to surgery for the treatment of thyroid nodules. RFA has been reported to be a safe and efficient treatment option in managing symptomatic cold thyroid nodules or hyperfunctioning thyroid nodules. In several uncontrolled clinical trials and in two randomized clinical trials, laser ablation has demonstrated a good efficacy and safety for the shrinkage of benign cold thyroid nodules. The aim of this study was to obtain solid evidence of the long-term efficacy of RFA and laser ablation in benign non-functioning solid thyroid nodules (BNFSTN). High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is a promising form of thermal ablation of benign thyroid nodules, but evidence supporting its use is scarce. Radiofrequency ablation has been advocated as an alternative to radioiodine and/or surgery for the treatment of autonomously functioning benign thyroid nodules. In conclusion, heat treatment (RFA or laser ablation) of benign nodules of the thyroid gland has been shown to be as effective as conventional surgical methods."
Can echinacea relieve the discomfort of colds???,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"Echinacea has been shown to decrease the odds of developing the common cold by 58% and the duration of a cold by 1.4 days. Additionally, echinacea has been traditionally employed to treat fungal and bacterial infections and has been used as an herbal remedy for the common cold. Echinacea extracts have been found to have various bioactivities, particularly those connected with immune responses. A meta-analysis evaluating the effect of echinacea on the incidence and duration of the common cold found that it was effective in reducing the symptoms and duration of the common cold. However, it is important to note that there are a variety of echinacea products on the market with different phytochemical compositions and that efficacy studies have produced conflicting results."
Does spirulina have a health-promoting effect???,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The evidence suggests that spirulina, a dietary supplement, has a variety of health benefits and therapeutic properties. It has been reported to have antiviral activities, boost the immune system, and improve growth performance by enhancing gut morphology. Spirulina supplementation has been associated with a significant decrease in body mass, body mass index, and waist circumference. It has also been shown to have a high antioxidant and anti-inflammatory potential, and to improve lipid, glucose, and blood pressure management. Furthermore, spirulina has been used as a food source for humans and animals due to its superior nutritional profile."
Is it harmful for the mental development of the unborn child if the mother regularly eats fish contaminated with mercury during pregnancy?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"Justification: The study indicates that higher fish consumption in pregnancy is associated with better infant cognition. However, higher mercury levels are associated with lower cognition. Maternal fish consumption exposes the mother to methylmercury, which can be harmful to fetal growth. While the relationship between intrauterine exposure to mercury and offspring IQ appears to be benign if the mother consumes fish, high levels of mercury exposure can result in damage to the brain of the developing fetus. The study found no evidence to suggest that prenatal levels of maternal blood mercury were associated with adverse development of the child, even when the mother had consumed no fish during pregnancy. However, the fact that certain fish species have high levels of methyl-mercury, leading to consumer advisory guidelines, suggests that regular consumption of fish contaminated with mercury during pregnancy can be harmful for the mental development of the unborn child."
"Does a nasal spray with carrageenan from red algae relieve discomfort from a cold (""chill"")?","['True', 'NEI', 'False']",No,Yes,Yes,"The use of a nasal spray containing carrageenan, a polysaccharide derived from red algae, has been shown to effectively reduce the duration of cold symptoms in both adults and children. Clinical trials have demonstrated that iota-carrageenan nasal spray significantly reduces the symptoms of common cold (p = 0.046) and the viral load in nasal lavages (p = 0.009) in patients with early symptoms of common cold. Furthermore, the use of carrageenan nasal spray in patients with virus-confirmed common cold has been shown to reduce the duration of disease, increase viral clearance, and reduce relapses of symptoms. The safety and efficacy of iota-carrageenan nasal spray have been established in clinical trials, and it has been shown to be a promising treatment for the safe and effective treatment of early symptoms of common cold."
Does the probability of dying from cardiovascular disease decrease in people who have already had a heart attack?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"Justification: The context suggests that the probability of dying from cardiovascular disease decreases in people who have already had a heart attack. This is supported by the observation that advances in the management of acute myocardial infarction have led to reduced in-hospital mortality, even when complicated by heart failure. However, it is noted that longer-term mortality remains high in these patients. Additionally, the incidence of heart failure after myocardial infarction has fallen over the last few decades, although it remains common. This indicates that while the risk of cardiovascular disease-related death may decrease after a heart attack, it does not eliminate the risk entirely."
"Are topical agents containing acids and oils, such as Excilor and Nailner, effective for nail fungus?","['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The results suggest that organic acids, such as those found in Excilor and Nailner, play a role in the antifungal effect of these topical agents. The study found that all tested formulations without organic acids were inactive, indicating the importance of these acids in the antifungal activity. Additionally, Excilor and Nailner demonstrated inhibitory activity against fungal nail infections, which was lower compared to the daily application of Loceryl, but still present. These findings suggest that topical agents containing acids and oils, such as Excilor and Nailner, can be effective for the treatment of nail fungus."
Do frequent ejaculations have a protective effect against prostate cancer?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"The evidence suggests that frequent ejaculations may have a protective effect against the development of prostate cancer. Studies have found that men who reported higher ejaculatory frequency in adulthood were less likely to be diagnosed with prostate cancer compared to those who reported lower frequency. This inverse relationship between ejaculation frequency and prostate cancer risk has been observed in a large US-based study, and is consistent with the theory that normal testicular function, including sufficient steroidogenesis, is an important contributing factor to the later development of this malignancy. However, it is important to note that the protective effect of frequent ejaculations may be limited to low-risk prostate cancer, as ejaculation frequency was not found to be statistically significantly associated with the risk of advanced prostate cancer. Additionally, while sexual activity has been hypothesized to play a role in the development of prostate cancer, the evidence is limited and further research is needed to fully understand the relationship between sexual activity and prostate cancer risk."
Does a nasal spray with carrageenan from red algae prevent colds?,"['True', 'False', 'NEI']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"Justification: The context suggests that carrageenan nasal spray has been shown to be an effective treatment for the common cold in both children and adults. The use of iota-carrageenan nasal spray has been found to reduce the duration of cold symptoms and viral load in nasal secretions. Additionally, carrageenan has been shown to have antiviral effectiveness against cold viruses in clinical trials. Therefore, it can be inferred that a nasal spray with carrageenan from red algae may prevent colds."
Does ozonated vegetable oil help against vaginal fungus??,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The context suggests that ozonated oils, including ozonized sunflower oil, have been tested for their antifungal properties. The study specifically mentions the investigation of Origanum vulgare L. essential oil as an alternative antimicrobial agent against vaginal infections. The oil was found to be efficacious against several clinical fungal strains, including Candida albicans, which is a common cause of vaginal yeast infections. Therefore, it can be inferred that ozonated vegetable oils may help against vaginal fungus. However, more specific studies on the use of ozonated oils for vaginal fungal infections are needed to confirm this."
Can over-the-counter combination medications help with tension headache and migraine better than medications containing only single active ingredients?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"The combination of acetylsalicylic acid, acetaminophen, and caffeine has been shown to be more efficacious and superior to monotherapy with the single substances of the combination in the treatment of migraine and tension-type headache. The use of other therapeutic approaches in combination with medications can increase the success of treatment for tension-type headaches. The combination of a triptan plus a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) has demonstrated better efficacy for the acute treatment of migraine. The proportion of headache episodes pain-free at 2 hours was significantly higher with the triple combination compared to acetaminophen and placebo. The combination of acetylsalicylic acid, acetaminophen, and caffeine is effective and well-tolerated in episodic tension-type headache and significantly superior to acetaminophen with regard to being pain-free at 2 hours, headache response at 2 hours, and ability to return to daily activities."
Does a diet rich in vitamin K2 protect against diseases of the cardiovascular system?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The evidence suggests that a high dietary intake of vitamin K2 is thought to decrease cardiovascular disease risk by reducing vascular calcification. An inverse association was observed between vitamin K2 intake and risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) with a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.91 [95% CI 0.85-1.00] per 10 microg/d vitamin K2 intake. Clinical evidence indicates that a high vitamin K status can exert a protective role in the inflammatory and mineralization processes associated with the onset and progression of age-related diseases, including cardiovascular diseases. However, it is important to note that inconsistent results have been reported and more research is needed to fully understand the role of vitamin K2 in cardiovascular health."
Do remedies with ginseng help with erectile dysfunction?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",No,Yes,Yes,"The study investigated the effects of tissue-cultured mountain ginseng extract (tmge) on male patients with erectile dysfunction (ED). The results showed that the overall therapeutic efficacies on ED were 60% for the ginseng group, compared to 30% for the placebo and trazodone treated groups. This statistically confirmed the effect of ginseng (p < 0.05). In Asia, ginseng is commonly included in herbals used for the treatment of sexual dysfunction. Korean ginseng and mountain ginseng (Panax ginseng ca meyer) are important traditional herbal plants whose ginsenosides are generally accepted as serving to improve sexual functions, such as penile erection. In the group receiving ginseng, changes in early detumescence and erectile parameters such as penile rigidity and girth, libido and patient satisfactions were significantly higher than that of other groups (p < 0.05). Several reports have promoted the root-derived Korean red ginseng (krg; Panax ginseng) as alternative treatment for ED, and ginsenosides are known to be the principal active ingredients of ginseng. Indeed, there is good evidence that ginsenosides can facilitate penile erection by directly inducing the vasodilatation and relaxation of penile corpus cavernosum. Animal studies lend growing support for the use of ginseng in the treatment of sexual dysfunction and provide increasing evidence for a role of nitric oxide in the mechanism of ginsenoside action."
Can masks reduce corona infections when worn by a large proportion of the population?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"The scientific evidence suggests that masks are efficacious in limiting the transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The use of masks, if worn properly and consistently, can be an effective nonpharmaceutical intervention in the control of disease spread. Masks are thought to have two modes of effect: they prevent infection with COVID-19 in wearers; and prevent transmission by individuals with subclinical infection. Community-wide mask wearing may contribute to the control of COVID-19 by reducing the amount of emission of infected saliva and respiratory droplets from individuals with subclinical or mild COVID-19. Even with suboptimal efficacy in both prevention of acquisition and transmission of infection, masks could substantially decrease the reproduction number for COVID-19 if widely used."
Do probiotics alleviate the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"The use of probiotics in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) has been increasingly studied, with several studies reporting significant improvements in symptoms compared to placebo. Probiotics have been shown to improve overall IBS symptoms, as well as abdominal pain scores. The mechanisms of action for probiotics in IBS are not fully understood, but they may include altering gut microflora, reducing mucosal inflammation, and exerting antibacterial effects. However, it is important to note that not all studies have reported significant improvements in symptoms after probiotic supplementation, and the results of trials are conflicting. Additionally, the use of specific combinations of probiotics or specific species and strains may be more effective than others. Overall, probiotics have the potential to impact the management of IBS, but further research is needed to fully understand their efficacy and safety."
,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",NEI,NEI,NEI,"The context does not provide specific information on the effectiveness and safety of the listed herbal appetite suppressants for weight loss support. However, it mentions hoodia gordonii as a popular 'weight loss' herb and appetite suppressant dietary supplement. Additionally, it discusses various herbs and their therapeutic effects, including hypoglycemic and anti-hyperglycemic properties, which may indirectly support weight loss. Nevertheless, without specific data on the listed herbs, it is not possible to definitively state their effectiveness and safety for weight loss support."
Does discontinuation of denosumab increase the risk of vertebral fractures???,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,".

     Justification: Multiple reports and studies indicate that discontinuation of denosumab is associated with an increased risk of vertebral fractures, particularly multiple vertebral fractures. This is due to a rebound effect, characterized by an increase in bone turnover, rapid bone loss, and a potential rebound in vertebral fracture risk. The risk is particularly high in patients with a prior vertebral fracture. The vertebral fracture rate has been observed to increase significantly upon denosumab discontinuation, similar to the level observed in untreated participants. Therefore, it is recommended that denosumab should not be stopped without considering alternative treatment to prevent rapid bone mineral density loss and a potential rebound in vertebral fracture risk."
Do pumpkin seed preparations improve symptoms caused by a benign enlarged prostate?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",No,Yes,Yes,"The context suggests that pumpkin seed preparations have been found to improve symptoms caused by a benign enlarged prostate. In a randomized, partially blinded, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial, the efficacy of pumpkin seed in men with lower urinary tract symptoms suggestive of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH/LUTS) was investigated. The results showed that 12 months of treatment with pumpkin seed led to a clinically relevant reduction in IPSS compared with placebo. Additionally, a randomized, double-blind study compared the preparation curbicin, obtained from pumpkin seeds and dwarf palm plants, with a placebo in the treatment of symptoms caused by prostatic hyperplasia. The results indicated that the oil-free hydroethanolic pumpkin seed extract was a well-tolerable and appropriate plant extract to support health benefits in a collective suffering from BPH-related symptoms without the need for medical treatment."
,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",NEI,NEI,NEI,"The context suggests that alpha-lipoic acid has been reported to prevent and reverse age-related impairments in learning and memory. However, it is unclear how alpha-lipoic acid improves cognitive function. The context also mentions that several studies have shown the protective effects of dietary enrichment of various lipids in several late-onset animal models of Alzheimer's disease, but none of the studies has determined which structure within a lipid determines its detrimental or beneficial effects on Alzheimer's disease. The context further suggests that alpha-lipoic acid may have a role in attenuating amyloid-beta mediated neurodegeneration, which is a major therapeutic consideration in the potential treatment of Alzheimer's disease. However, the context does not provide enough information to definitively conclude that alpha-lipoic acid helps prevent or treat Alzheimer's disease."
Can pain from osteoarthritis (joint wear) be relieved by arnica ointment or arnica gel?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"The context suggests that arnica preparations, including ointments and gels, have been used for the symptomatic treatment of rheumatic complaints and have demonstrated beneficial effects in the treatment of osteoarthritis (OA). A randomized, double-blind study in 204 patients with radiologically confirmed and symptomatically active OA of the interphalangeal joints of the hands found that arnica preparations were not inferior to ibuprofen in terms of pain relief and hand function after 21 days of treatment. The efficacy of arnica is presumed to be mainly due to its anti-inflammatory properties and inhibition of the transcription factor NF-kappab. Therefore, it can be inferred that pain from osteoarthritis can be relieved by arnica ointment or arnica gel."
Does a ketogenic diet help against cancer?,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",NEI,NEI,NEI,"The ketogenic diet (KD), a high-fat, low-carbohydrate, and adequate-protein diet, has been proposed as a potential adjunctive therapy for cancer. The diet has been suggested to enhance traditional anticancer therapy, prevent tumor progression, and improve the efficacy of chemotherapy and radiotherapy. However, the exact mechanisms of its therapeutic effect are not completely known, and the results of studies on its use in cancer treatment are not yet supportive and inconsistent. While some studies have suggested that KD may be efficacious in certain cancer subtypes, high-quality evidence on the effect of KD on anthropometry, metabolism, quality of life, and tumor effects is currently lacking in oncology patients. Therefore, it is not possible to definitively state whether a ketogenic diet helps against cancer based on the available evidence."
Does taking magnesium improve the symptoms of depression?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The evidence suggests that magnesium supplementation is associated with improved depressive symptoms. Magnesium has been shown to have an effect on biological and transduction pathways implicated in the pathophysiology of depression. Preclinical and clinical evidence suggests that magnesium, an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor blocker, may be useful in the treatment of depression. Oral magnesium supplementation may prevent depression and might be used as an adjunctive therapy. Lower serum magnesium levels have been associated with depressive symptoms in adults seen in primary care, supporting the use of supplemental magnesium as therapy. Animal studies have also demonstrated that magnesium exerts an antidepressant effect. However, the mechanism of action is not fully understood, and the role of magnesium in depression prevention and treatment remains unclear."
Do plant hormones (phytoestrogens) other than genistein reduce the number and intensity of hot flashes during menopause?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"Phytoestrogens, plant-derived compounds with estrogenic activity, have been shown to positively influence menopausal discomforts, including hot flashes. These compounds, which include but are not limited to genistein, are capable of reducing hot flashes via their estrogen-like hormone actions. The effects of phytoestrogens on thermoregulatory mechanisms may help explain their beneficial effects in alleviating hot flashes and other menopausal discomforts. Certain botanicals, such as red clover, are known to contain phytoestrogenic activity and have been shown to help with hot flushes, a common menopausal complaint. The use of phytoestrogens in menopausal therapy has been proposed to be beneficial to women's health, particularly with respect to hot flushes. In recent years, plants with high phytoestrogen content have been recommended as therapeutic agents for postmenopausal hormonal treatment. These substances can act as either agonists or antagonists of estrogen receptors α and β. Phytoestrogens are widely used to alleviate menopausal symptoms, such as hot flushes and night sweats. The potential effects of phytoestrogens on hot flashes and their molecular mechanisms of action on the thermoregulatory center are discussed in the literature. The results from this study indicate that consumption of dietary phytoestrogens alters the neuroendocrine mechanism of core body temperature regulation that may help explain, in part, the beneficial effects of phytoestrogens for hot flashes."
Can a height-adjustable desk reduce sitting time in the office?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"The present study investigated the effects of prompting the use of height-adjustable working desks (HAWD) on occupational sitting and standing time in office workers. The findings suggest that introducing a sit-to-stand workstation can significantly reduce sedentary time and increase light activity levels during working hours. Sit-stand desks have been identified as a potential strategy to reduce sitting time, and studies have reported that height-adjustable workstation interventions reduced occupational sitting time in office workers. Single-desk sit-to-stand workplaces exhibit small sitting time reduction potential, while standing and treadmill desks show some utility for breaking up sitting time. Sit-stand desks were effective in reducing workplace sedentary behavior in an at-risk population. However, their cost can limit scalability, and limited evidence is available on usage patterns of sit-stand tables and whether patterns are influenced by table configuration."
Can Echinacea protect against colds?,"['True', 'False', 'NEI']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"The evidence suggests that Echinacea may have a protective effect against the common cold. A meta-analysis found that Echinacea decreased the odds of developing the common cold by 58% and shortened the duration of a cold by 1.4 days. Additionally, Echinacea has been shown to reduce the severity and duration of colds and other upper respiratory infections when given as soon as symptoms become evident. However, it is important to note that individual prophylaxis trials have not shown an association with the prevention of the common cold. Nonetheless, the overall evidence suggests that Echinacea may be beneficial in reducing the incidence and duration of the common cold."
Does yoga alleviate the severity of persistent back pain???,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",No,Yes,Yes,"Justification: The context provides evidence that yoga is an effective therapy for chronic low back pain, with studies suggesting its efficacy for moderate to severe cases. Yoga has been found to significantly reduce pain in the short and intermediate term compared to non-exercise, with effects lasting up to 6 to 7 months. The possible mechanism of yoga in alleviating chronic pain is by refining brain-grounded maps of the body. Although the comparative effectiveness of yoga and physical therapy is unknown, yoga has been shown to have the same effect on pain and disability as other exercises or physical therapy. Therefore, it can be concluded that yoga alleviates the severity of persistent back pain."
"Do hormonal contraceptives to swallow (the ""pill"") affect endurance performance in women?","['True', 'NEI', 'False']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"The use of oral contraceptives has been shown to influence endurance performance in women, primarily through alterations in lipolytic activity and hemodynamics during exercise. Oral contraceptives may increase lipid mobilization in the postprandial state, but this effect is blunted when lipolytic activity is stimulated by exercise. The use of combined oral contraceptive pills has been shown to increase blood volume, stroke volume, and cardiac output during exercise, which may be advantageous to the physical fitness of female athletes. However, low-dose oral contraceptive usage is associated with a decrease in functional aerobic capacity, which may negatively impact endurance performance. The effects of oral contraceptives on endurance performance are complex and depend on various factors, including the amount and type of hormones in the pill, duration of use, and individual genetic predisposition."
Does Cryolipolysis cause noticeable body fat reduction?,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"Cryolipolysis has been shown to significantly reduce localized subcutaneous fat, including submental fat. This non-invasive fat reduction method is capable of reducing subcutaneous fat without damaging surrounding tissues, by applying cold temperature to induce adipocyte apoptosis. Previous clinical studies have demonstrated the safety and efficacy of cryolipolysis for the reduction of localized subcutaneous fat on abdomen and flanks, with an average fat loss of 39.6cc of the treated flank at 2 months after a single treatment cycle. Cryolipolysis is a promising procedure for nonsurgical fat reduction and body contouring, and has received FDA clearance for fat reduction in the abdomen, flanks, and thighs. Cryolipolysis with colder temperature and reduced treatment time continues to be effective and safe for noninvasive reduction of submental fat. Therefore, it can be concluded that cryolipolysis does cause noticeable body fat reduction."
Does the intake of omega-3 fatty acids improve the clinical picture in multiple sclerosis (MS) or does this inhibit progression of the disease?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",No,Yes,Yes,"The intake of omega-3 fatty acids has been shown to improve the clinical picture in multiple sclerosis (MS) and inhibit the progression of the disease. Omega-3 fatty acids, including EPA, DPA, and DHA, have been found to have beneficial effects on reducing the relapsing rate, inflammatory markers, and improving the quality of life for MS patients. Recent trial studies have shown that omega-3 supplementation can beneficially improve scores on the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), which is considered a gold standard for measuring disability and disease severity in MS patients, as well as reducing neuroinflammation. Omega-3 fatty acids are suggested to have anti-inflammatory properties that might be beneficial in MS. Dietary supplementation containing a variety of nutrients, including omega-3 fatty acids, has been shown to improve the quality of life, severity of disease symptoms, and functionality in MS patients."
Is a vegan diet healthier than a vegetarian diet?,"['True', 'False', 'NEI']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The evidence suggests that a vegan diet may confer additional health benefits compared to a vegetarian diet. Vegan diets tend to contain less saturated fat and cholesterol and more dietary fiber than other vegetarian diets. The fat content of the vegan diet is significantly lower and the polyunsaturated:saturated fatty acid ratio is higher than in the omnivore diet. Vegans also have lower intakes of energy and saturated fat compared to omnivores. Cross-sectional studies have shown that on average, vegetarians and vegans have a relatively low BMI and a low plasma cholesterol concentration. However, it should be noted that vegans may have lower intakes of certain nutrients, such as vitamin B12, compared to vegetarians and omnivores. Overall, the available literature suggests that a vegetarian/vegan diet is effective in promoting a diverse ecosystem of beneficial bacteria to support both human gut microbiome and overall health. From a public health viewpoint, the health benefits of a well-planned vegetarian diet far outweigh the potential risks."
Does CBD or cannabis use protect against covid-19 disease???,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",NEI,NEI,NEI,"The provided context does not contain any information regarding the effects of CBD or cannabis use on COVID-19 disease. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether CBD or cannabis use protects against COVID-19 disease based on the given information. Further research is needed to establish a connection between CBD or cannabis use and COVID-19 disease."
Does a newly approved contraceptive pill with the active ingredient combination nomegestrol acetate and 17ß-estradiol have fewer undesirable side effects than other birth control pills?,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",No,NEI,NEI,"The provided context indicates that the combined oral contraceptive containing nomegestrol acetate and 17β-estradiol (e2) has been shown to be at least as effective as drospirenone/ethinylestradiol in terms of contraceptive efficacy and cycle control. However, the context does not provide a direct comparison of the undesirable side effects of this contraceptive pill with other birth control pills. The context does mention that the pill containing nomegestrol acetate and 17β-estradiol was generally well tolerated in healthy adult women, with an acceptable tolerability profile in line with that expected for a combined oral contraceptive. However, the context does not provide enough information to definitively state that this pill has fewer undesirable side effects than other birth control pills. Therefore, the answer is NEI (not enough information)."
Are movement exercises useful for back pain?,"['True', 'False', 'NEI']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"The systematic review investigated the effect of movement-based interventions on movement patterns of people with low back pain and the relationship between changes in movement patterns and subsequent changes in pain and activity limitation. The review found that exercise interventions, including back extension exercises, lumbar muscle stabilisation exercises, and back endurance-resistance exercises, may be effective at reducing pain or disability in patients with low back pain. Stabilization exercises for patients with low back pain may help to decrease pain and disability. A relationship between changes to movement patterns and improvements in pain or activity limitation was observed in several studies. Specific lumbar strengthening showed clinically relevant improvements in pain and disability in patients with persistent chronic low back pain. Therefore, movement exercises are useful for back pain."
Does self urine help with health problems?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The context suggests that urine plays a role in human health beyond waste excretion, and that urine-based biomarkers can be used as diagnostic and prognostic tools in clinical trials and patient care. Additionally, the context indicates that individuals with lower urinary tract symptoms may need guidance in fluid management, and that adequate hydration is more useful in the management of urinary incontinence. Therefore, it can be inferred that self-urine may help with health problems, particularly those related to the urinary system. However, further research is needed to fully understand the potential bioactivity of urine and its role in health and disease."
Does colonoscopy reduce mortality from colorectal cancer?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"Observational studies have demonstrated that colonoscopy significantly reduces the incidence and mortality of colorectal cancer (CRC) in the general population. Compared to no endoscopic screening, receipt of a screening colonoscopy has been associated with a 67% reduction in the risk of death from any colorectal cancer. Pooled analysis has shown that colonoscopy is associated with a 61% reduction in CRC incidence and a 61% reduction in CRC mortality in patients with non-malignant findings. Furthermore, colonoscopy has been found to have a substantial impact on CRC incidence and mortality through the detection and removal of precancerous lesions and early cancers. These findings support the use of colonoscopy as an efficient and preferred screening method to reduce the incidence and associated mortality from CRC."
Can lack of sleep cause obesity?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The evidence suggests that inadequate sleep can contribute to obesity through various mechanisms. Sleep deprivation has been hypothesized to decrease leptin, increase ghrelin, and compromise insulin sensitivity, which can lead to increased hunger and food intake. Prospective studies have indicated that reduced habitual sleep duration is an independent risk factor for weight gain and incident obesity. The increased prevalence of obesity in Western nations has been paralleled by a severe reduction in sleep duration. Insufficient sleep has been identified as a risk factor for weight gain, and it increases the risk for insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, and obesity. The underlying pathogenic pathways are complex and unresolved, but the evidence supports the hypothesis that sleep duration is associated with obesity."
Does acupuncture help against hay fever?,"['True', 'False', 'NEI']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"Existing evidence suggests that acupuncture may be beneficial in the prevention and treatment of asthma, and it has been widely used to treat patients with allergic rhinitis. The article discusses the possible mechanisms underlying the effects of acupuncture in the prevention and treatment of asthma, including its anti-inflammatory effects, modulation of TH1/TH2 balance, blockage of inflammatory cells and mediators, improvement of airway remodeling, and regulation of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis function. Individualized homeopathic treatment has been associated with significant alleviation of hay fever symptoms, and acupuncture has been shown to have beneficial effects on asthma without changing the concentration of serum cortisol. A trial has been conducted to investigate the effectiveness of acupressure in reducing the severity of allergic rhinitis symptoms and improving sleep quality in pediatric patients with allergic rhinitis, and the results showed a significant reduction in symptoms and improvement in sleep quality after acupressure treatment with no adverse effects. Therefore, it can be concluded that acupuncture may be a promising alternative therapy for hay fever."
Can vitamin C prevent infection with coronavirus or prevent deaths from covid-19?,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",NEI,NEI,NEI,"The evidence to date indicates that oral vitamin C (2-8 g/day) may reduce the incidence and duration of respiratory infections. Intravenous vitamin C (6-24 g/day) has been shown to reduce mortality, intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital stays, and time on mechanical ventilation for severe respiratory infections. However, it is not clear whether vitamin C can prevent infection with coronavirus or prevent deaths from COVID-19. Further studies are needed to elaborate on the efficacy of intravenous vitamin C in critically ill COVID-19 patients."
"Do plant extracts of African plum tree, beta-sitosterol or ryegrass pollen extract (Cernilton) help benign prostate enlargement?","['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The context suggests that plant extracts of African plum tree (Prunus africana), beta-sitosterol, and ryegrass pollen extract (Cernilton) have been used in traditional medicine to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Clinical trials have been conducted to examine the effectiveness of these botanicals in treating BPH symptoms. The results indicate that a combination of natural products, including Cernilton, saw palmetto, beta-sitosterol, and vitamin E, can significantly lessen nocturia and frequency and diminish overall symptomatology of BPH. Oral supplementation of rats implanted with LNCaP cells with Epilobium angustifolium aqueous extract resulted in a reduction of the occurrence of prostatic adenoma up to 13%. Furthermore, Cernilton formulas have been shown to significantly reduce androgen receptor and prostate-specific antigen protein expression in stromal cells. These findings suggest that plant extracts of African plum tree, beta-sitosterol, and ryegrass pollen extract (Cernilton) may be effective in helping benign prostate enlargement."
Does alkaline water keep you healthy or can it prevent disease?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The scientific literature suggests that alkaline water may have a positive impact on health and disease prevention. Studies have shown that alkaline water supplementation can improve aging at the molecular level and enhance the antioxidant response. Additionally, the consumption of hard water, which is often alkaline, is presumed to protect against the development of arteriosclerotic diseases. Furthermore, irrigation of the urinary tract with alkaline solutions has been shown to dissolve uric acid stones in some clinical situations. However, it is important to note that further research is needed to fully understand the biological importance and roles of electrolyte abnormalities in promoting, antagonizing, or otherwise enabling the development of diseases such as cancer."
"Does a herbal combination preparation of rosemary, lovage, and centaury effectively relieve symptoms of uncomplicated cystitis?","['NEI', 'True', 'False']",Yes,NEI,NEI,"The context does not provide information on the effectiveness of a herbal combination preparation of rosemary, lovage, and centaury in relieving symptoms of uncomplicated cystitis. While it discusses the use of rosemary in pain management and its potential therapeutic effects in combination with analgesic drugs, it does not mention the specific combination of herbs in question or its efficacy in treating cystitis. Therefore, there is not enough information to make a definitive conclusion."
Does the herbal hormone genistein reduce the number and intensity of hot flashes during menopause???,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"The herbal hormone genistein has been shown to reduce the number and intensity of hot flashes during menopause. In a 24-month, prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, pure administration of genistein (54 mg/d) was found to reduce the number and severity of hot flushes in postmenopausal women, with no adverse effect on the endometrium and vagina. Genistein supplemented subjects demonstrated a 51% reduction in the number of hot flushes by week 12 compared to a 27% reduction in the placebo group. The current study provides the first evidence that a single daily dose of 30 mg of synthetic genistein reduces hot flush frequency and duration. Genistein has also been shown to have a preventive role against bone mass loss during menopause and may provide an alternative to hormone therapy in those patients at risk for ischemic events."
Does the active ingredient rivaroxaban (drug Xarelto) have a higher risk of dangerous bleeding than other anticoagulants?,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",No,No,No,"The active ingredient rivaroxaban (Xarelto) does not have a higher risk of dangerous bleeding than other anticoagulants. While rivaroxaban does expose a risk of bleeding, including major bleeding and intracranial hemorrhage, it was not associated with an increased risk of fatal bleeding compared to placebo. In fact, rivaroxaban was associated with a significant decrease in fatal bleeding compared to other anticoagulants. Additionally, the risk of major bleeding in general may be lower with rivaroxaban than for warfarin, although the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding or abnormal uterine bleeding may be higher. Overall, rivaroxaban was not associated with an increased risk of a composite end point of major or clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding."

Does increased time outdoors inhibit myopia in children?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"Justification: Recent epidemiological evidence suggests that children who spend more time outdoors are less likely to be, or to become myopic. A significant protective effect of outdoor time was found for incident myopia and prevalent myopia. Increased time outdoors is effective in preventing the onset of myopia as well as in slowing the myopic shift in refractive error. Outdoor time is considered to reduce the risk of developing myopia, and more time outdoors is associated with a lesser risk of myopia. Clinical trials are now underway to reduce the development of myopia in children by increasing the amount of time they spend outdoors."
Does taking antibiotics for acute sinusitis speed up the healing of the infection?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"The use of antibiotics for acute sinusitis has been shown to provide a small benefit for clinical outcomes in immunocompetent primary care patients. Antibiotics have a small treatment effect in patients with uncomplicated acute sinusitis in a primary care setting with symptoms for more than seven days. Antimicrobial therapy for sinusitis has been shown to reduce or eliminate pathologic bacteria associated with rhinosinusitis and improve the symptoms associated with the disease. The preferred antibiotic for treatment is amoxicillin or TMP-SMZ, as most acute sinus infections are caused by H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae. Radiographic outcomes were improved by antibiotic treatment. However, it is not clear whether antibiotics improve the outcome for patients with clinically diagnosed acute rhinosinusitis. Most acute sinusitis cases not prescribed antibiotics resolve spontaneously."
"Does amygdalin, the toxin from the seeds of apricots and other stone fruits, help against cancer?","['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The context provided suggests that amygdalin, a compound found in the seeds of apricots and other stone fruits, has potential anticancer properties. This is supported by multiple studies that have demonstrated its ability to inhibit the proliferation of cancer cells and induce their apoptosis. The compound has been found to have antitumor properties and has been suggested as a potential chemopreventive agent. The studies have shown that amygdalin may have an anticancer effect due to its ability to influence various gene expressions in human cancer cells. The evidence suggests that amygdalin could potentially be used as a natural therapeutic anticancer drug. However, it is important to note that the anticancer effect of amygdalin remains controversial and further research is needed to fully understand its potential benefits and risks."

The findings demonstrate that music has a beneficial effect on cognitive processes in patients with disorders of consciousness. The review also examines the possibility that training-related changes in the brains of musicians may have a beneficial effect on their cognitive outcome and recovery following neurological damage. Furthermore, music listening has been shown to improve cognitive functions in both healthy subjects and patients with neurological impairment. Neurosensory stimulation, including music, has been found to be effective in enhancing the recovery process of severely brain-injured patients with disorders of consciousness."
Does the use of laptops with active WLAN (wireless internet access) affect sperm quality in men?,"['True', 'False', 'NEI']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"Justification: The use of laptops with active WLAN has been found to affect sperm quality in men. Ex vivo exposure of human spermatozoa to a wireless internet-connected laptop for 4 hours resulted in a significant decrease in progressive sperm motility and an increase in sperm DNA fragmentation. The electromagnetic fields generated by laptop's internal electronic circuits as well as the Wi-Fi radiofrequency radiation hazards may decrease sperm quality. However, further studies are needed to fully understand the long-term effects of laptop use on male fertility."
Does alcohol in moderate amounts prolong life?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"The context suggests that long-term light to moderate alcohol consumption is associated with a decreased risk of death and cardiac events. This is supported by several epidemiological studies, including the Zutphen study, which found that light to moderate drinkers had a lower risk of death and cardiac events compared to never or occasional drinkers. Furthermore, moderate alcohol consumption has been linked to better cognitive health in middle-aged and older adults. However, it is important to note that the mechanisms underlying the cardioprotective effect of light to moderate alcohol intake are not well understood, and more studies are needed to verify these findings. Additionally, the context mentions that heavy alcohol use can have detrimental effects on brain functioning and may resemble age-related changes. Therefore, while moderate alcohol consumption may have some health benefits, it is important to consume alcohol in moderation and consider individual health factors."
Does mistletoe therapy help against cancer or can it improve the quality of life of cancer patients?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The use of mistletoe extracts as a complementary treatment for cancer has been reported to improve the quality of life of cancer patients. Several clinical studies have shown that mistletoe therapy may improve cancer patients' quality of life, although the nature of this improvement is not yet fully understood. In patients with locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic carcinoma, mistletoe treatment has been shown to significantly improve the quality of life compared to best supportive care alone. Additionally, systematic reviews of mistletoe therapy trials in cancer have shown promising results in improving patients' quality of life during chemotherapy and reducing fatigue. However, the clinical efficacy of mistletoe in cancer and associated survival benefits remain contested, and further research is needed to fully understand its effects on immunological parameters and overall survival."
"Does oseltamivir (brand name ""Tamiflu"") reduce the severity and duration of influenza in otherwise healthy adults?","['True', 'NEI', 'False']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"Oseltamivir, marketed as Tamiflu, has been shown to be effective in reducing the severity and duration of influenza in otherwise healthy adults. As a neuraminidase inhibitor, it works by preventing the release of the virus from infected cells, thereby reducing the spread of the infection. Clinical studies have demonstrated that oseltamivir significantly reduces the duration of fever and influenza-like symptoms. In a study involving 2288 patients, oseltamivir treatment reduced the mean time to symptom alleviation by 1.08 days. Furthermore, it has been found to reduce the risk of lower respiratory tract complications and hospital admittance. However, it is important to note that oseltamivir treatment may increase the occurrence of nausea and vomiting."
Can vitamin and nutrient supplements prevent the eye disease age-related macular degeneration?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",No,Yes,Yes,"The Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) has demonstrated that oral supplementation with antioxidant vitamins and minerals can have beneficial effects on the development of advanced age-related macular degeneration (AMD) in individuals with at least intermediate AMD. The treatment of dry AMD is primarily based on vitamin supplementation. The evidence suggests that antioxidant vitamin and mineral supplementation can slow the progression of AMD, particularly in individuals with moderate to severe signs of the disease. Antioxidant nutrients, such as vitamins C and E and beta-carotene, have been shown to be protective of some eye disorders, including AMD. Oral supplementation with the AREDS formulation (antioxidant vitamins C and E, beta-carotene, and zinc) has been shown to reduce the risk of progression to advanced AMD. While the question of whether individuals with AMD should take antioxidant vitamin or mineral supplements to prevent progression of the disease has not been definitively answered by research to date, the available evidence suggests that such supplements may be beneficial in preventing the onset or progression of disabling eye disease."
Does CBD help with sleep disorders?,"['NEI', 'False', 'True']",NEI,NEI,NEI,"Justification: The provided context does not contain any information regarding the use of CBD for sleep disorders.

The extract contains bacosides, which have been reported to have a memory-enhancing effect. The extract has been found to improve learning and memory, potentially through increased cell proliferation and neuroblast differentiation in the dentate gyrus. It has also been shown to exert a neuroprotective effect against mental diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. The extract is available as an over-the-counter herbal remedy for memory enhancement in both children and adults. Therefore, based on the provided context, it can be concluded that taking Bacopa extract may improve memory performance."
,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"Justification: Recent evidence suggests that music-based movement (mbm) therapy may be a promising intervention to improve gait and gait-related activities in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. Entrainment of walking to rhythmic auditory cues, such as music, has been shown to improve gait in people with PD. Additionally, rhythmic auditory stimulation (RAS) can influence movement during straight line walking and direction transition in individuals with PD. Music therapy and other music and rhythm-based interventions may offer a range of symptomatic benefits to patients with PD and other movement disorders. Recent behavioral data has shown beneficial effects of musically cued gait training (mcgt) on gait performance, perceptual timing, and sensorimotor timing abilities in PD patients. Walking while mentally singing has potential for improving the gait of individuals with PD."
Can some forms of headache be successfully treated with heat?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"Justification: The context suggests that heat has been used for comfort and analgesia, and is recommended as a first-line therapy in many clinical guidelines. High-level pulsed heat has been found to produce significantly more analgesia compared to steady heat. Additionally, a randomized trial has evaluated the short-term efficacy of local heat on the pain caused by cervical osteoarthrosis. The use of heat for the treatment of headaches is also supported by the fact that heat has been used for over a century for its therapeutic effects on pain. Therefore, it can be inferred that some forms of headache can be successfully treated with heat."

Which of the three most common laser eye surgeries produces the best results and has the fewest side effects?,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",Yes,NEI,NEI,"The context does not provide a direct comparison of the three most common laser eye surgeries in terms of best results and fewest side effects. However, it does suggest that the outcome of laser eye surgery is more dependent on operator technique and patient selection than the type of laser used. The three most common laser eye surgeries mentioned are small incision lenticule extraction, laser-assisted keratomileusis in situ, and photorefractive keratotomy. The context also mentions a study comparing the effects of three different corneal refractive surgeries: microkeratome laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK), femtosecond laser in situ keratomileusis (FS-LASIK), and femtosecond small incision lenticule extraction (FS-SMILE) on 6-month postoperative stability of tear film. However, it does not provide a clear conclusion on which of these surgeries produces the best results and has the fewest side effects."
Does DAILY administration of HIGH-dose atropine (0.5 - 1%) sustainably inhibit the progression of myopia in children?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",No,Yes,Yes,"The daily administration of high-dose atropine (0.5 - 1%) has been shown to sustainably inhibit the progression of myopia in children. A starting dose of atropine 0.5% was associated with decreased progression in European children during a 3-year treatment regimen. In a prospective clinical effectiveness study, children with progressive myopia ≥1d/year or myopia ≤-2.5d were prescribed atropine 0.5%. The effectiveness of atropine in controlling the progression of myopia was dose-related. In a study cohort, topical atropine 1% reduced the degree of low myopia and slowed the progression of ocular axial elongation in children. The results of this study demonstrate that long-term and regular instillation of low-concentration atropine eye drops is effective for controlling myopia progression and provides a possible strategy for an initial myopia regimen."
Are diets with reduced carbohydrate content better for weight loss than other weight loss programs?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",No,Yes,Yes,"Justification: The evidence from randomized controlled trials suggests that low-carbohydrate diets may enable short-term weight loss by facilitating reduced energy intakes. Compared with low-fat diets, low-carbohydrate diets have been associated with significantly greater reduction in weight. Very low-carbohydrate diets containing less than 60 g carbohydrate per day appear more effective at inducing weight loss over 6 months than low-fat kilojoule-controlled diets. The probability of greater weight loss associated with low-carbohydrate diets is >99%. However, it is important to note that the long-term clinical safety and efficacy of these diets have not been studied, and poor dietary compliance may prevent long-term success."
Does regular consumption of red meat or processed meat products increase the risk of colorectal cancer?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"Current evidence indicates that regular consumption of red meat or processed meat products is associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer. This association is supported by numerous epidemiological studies, which have found that diets high in red meat and processed meats are established risk factors for colorectal cancer. The frequency of red meat consumption, rather than the total amount consumed, has been linked to a higher risk of colorectal carcinogenesis. The potential role of meat cooking practices in this association is not yet fully understood, but it has been suggested that red meat may contribute to colorectal cancer risk by increasing exposure to n-nitroso compounds."
Does taking rosehip powder for osteoarthritis alleviate the symptoms???,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The evidence supports the claim that taking rosehip powder can alleviate symptoms of osteoarthritis. Clinical studies have shown that rose hip powder (RHP) has anti-inflammatory and cartilage-protective properties, which contribute to its ability to alleviate osteoarthritis (OA). A systematic review and meta-analysis have concluded that the consumption of standardized rose hip powder can reduce pain in OA patients. Furthermore, a meta-analysis of three randomized controlled trials reported that treatment with standardized rosehip powder consistently reduced pain scores and that patients allocated to rosehip powder were twice as likely to respond to rosehip compared to placebo. The results of these studies indicate that rose-hip possesses anti-inflammatory properties and might be used as a replacement or supplement for conventional drug therapies in patients with OA."
Does extra folic acid in men help prevent birth defects in children?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The context suggests that paternal folic acid intake is associated with improved sperm quality and reduced risk of congenital malformations in offspring. Men with high folate intake have lower frequencies of sperm with disomies X, 21, sex nullisomy, and a lower aggregate measure of sperm aneuploidy compared to men with lower intake. Additionally, folic acid supplement users before pregnancy have a reduced risk of overall congenital heart defects compared to non-users. Therefore, extra folic acid in men may help prevent birth defects in children."
Is oolong tea an effective way to lose weight?,"['True', 'False', 'NEI']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The evidence suggests that oolong tea may be an effective method for weight loss and obesity prevention. Studies have shown that oolong tea can decrease body fat content and reduce body weight through improving lipid metabolism. Chronic consumption of oolong tea has been found to prevent against obesity. The anti-obesity effects of oolong tea are thought to be due to its ability to enhance noradrenaline-induced lipolysis in adipose tissue and inhibit pancreatic lipase activity. Additionally, oolong tea has been found to lower blood total cholesterol, TAG, and LDL-cholesterol levels, which are associated with obesity and cardiovascular disease."
Can FLEXISEQ ointment relieve osteoarthritis pain?,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",NEI,NEI,NEI,"The context does not provide information on the efficacy of FLEXISEQ ointment in relieving osteoarthritis pain. However, it does mention the effectiveness of various other treatments, such as joint lavage, topical diclofenac diethylamine gel, intravenous lignocaine, and heat application, in managing osteoarthritis pain.

The context also highlights the importance of symptom control and pain reduction in current medical therapy strategies for osteoarthritis."
Do probiotic foods have an antidepressant effect or a positive effect on the mind?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The available evidence suggests that probiotic foods may have a positive effect on the mind and potentially act as an antidepressant. A meta-analysis demonstrated that probiotics significantly decreased the depression scale score in subjects (md = -0.30, 95% ci (-0.51--0.09), p = 0.005). The positive impact of probiotic supplementation on depressive symptoms has been observed in both preclinical and clinical studies. Probiotics have been found to benefit the central nervous system via the microbiota-gut-brain axis, which raises the possibility that they are effective in managing depression. The intake of probiotics may help reduce negative thoughts associated with sad mood. Probiotic consumption has been shown to have a positive effect on psychological symptoms of depression, anxiety, and perceived stress in healthy human volunteers. The antidepressant-like activity of probiotics is correlated with lactobacillus species via the gut microbiota-inflammation-brain axis. However, further research is warranted to fully understand the potential of probiotics as a preventive strategy for depression."
"Does honey heal small, fresh wounds faster than the usual wound treatment?","['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The evidence from animal studies and clinical trials suggests that honey may accelerate wound healing in both acute and chronic wounds. Honey has been shown to possess antibacterial properties, promote autolytic debridement, and stimulate the growth of wound tissues to hasten healing. In acute wounds, specifically partial-thickness burns, honey has been found to reduce time to healing compared with some conventional dressings. Honey has also been shown to improve healing times in mild to moderate superficial and partial thickness burns compared with some conventional dressings. Therefore, it can be concluded that honey may heal small, fresh wounds faster than the usual wound treatment."
Can remedies from papaya improve digestion or relieve gastrointestinal discomfort?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The evidence suggests that remedies from papaya can improve digestion and relieve gastrointestinal discomfort. Papaya (Carica papaya L.) is known to contain high levels of enzymes that support digestive function, and former clinical observations have revealed positive effects for patients with constipation, heartburn, and symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) after consuming papaya preparations. Furthermore, papaya seed extract and its principal bioactive constituent, BITC, have been shown to weaken the contractile capability of rabbit isolated jejunum, indicating a potential role in reducing gastrointestinal discomfort. Additionally, the traditional use of papaya to treat various diseases, including skin conditions, has prompted research into its potential benefits for wound healing and reducing chronic inflammation."
"Does the preparation ""CAPS immu"" from Ringana reduce the risk of infections in healthy people?","['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The context suggests that the use of a proprietary larch arabinogalactan preparation, such as that found in ""CAPS immu"" from Ringana, has been shown to increase the body's potential to defend against common cold infections. In a placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized clinical trial, the number of participants affected by a cold was significantly reduced by arabinogalactan supplementation. The study also found that arabinogalactan tended to decrease the incidence of common cold in the full analysis set. These findings suggest that ""CAPS immu"" from Ringana may reduce the risk of infections in healthy people."
Do milk or dairy products promote colon cancer and rectal cancer?,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",No,No,No,"The epidemiological evidence suggests that milk and dairy products have a protective role against colorectal cancer, including colon and rectal cancer. Prospective studies have reported an inverse association between the consumption of total dairy products and milk and the risk of colorectal cancer. The World Cancer Research Fund International/American Institute for Cancer Research states that it is 'probable' that dairy products decrease the risk of colorectal cancer. Furthermore, genetically proxied milk consumption was associated with a reduced risk of colorectal cancer. Therefore, the claim that milk or dairy products promote colon cancer and rectal cancer is not supported by the available evidence."
Can regular exercise prevent you from getting a cold or other respiratory infections???,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",No,Yes,Yes,"Regular, moderate-intensity exercise has been shown to have a positive effect on the prevention of the common cold and other respiratory infections. A meta-analysis found that the effect of exercise on the prevention of the common cold had a relative risk of 0.73, indicating a reduced risk of infection compared to a sedentary lifestyle. Regular moderate exercise has been associated with a reduced risk of upper respiratory tract infections, while unusually heavy acute or chronic exercise may increase the risk. However, it is important to note that intense exercise may reduce immunity and increase the risk of infection, particularly in athletes who already have a cold. In conclusion, regular moderate exercise can help prevent the common cold and other respiratory infections, but it is important to avoid intense exercise during ongoing infection and fever."
Does unprocessed red meat increase the risk of cardiovascular disease?,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",NEI,No,No,"The consumption of unprocessed red meat has been associated with a smaller increase or no risk of cardiovascular disease, as compared to processed meat. Epidemiologic evidence suggests that the relationships of red meat consumption with the risk of cardiovascular diseases depend on whether or not the meat is processed, including the addition of preservatives. In meta-analyses of prospective cohorts, a higher risk of coronary heart disease is seen with processed meat consumption, but a smaller increase or no risk is seen with unprocessed meat consumption. The overall findings suggest that neither unprocessed red nor processed meat consumption is beneficial for cardiometabolic health, and clinical and public health guidance should especially prioritize reducing processed meat consumption."
Can hyposensitization by injections with allergy-causing pollen components help with hay fever?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"The context suggests that allergen injection immunotherapy, specifically grass pollen immunotherapy, is effective for summer hay fever. This treatment acts by inhibiting allergen-induced T lymphocyte and eosinophil recruitment and eosinophil activation in the target organ. The mechanism possibly involves protective local increases in Th1-type cells. Clinical improvement in hay fever is accompanied by a significant reduction in the immediate cutaneous response to grass pollen. Additionally, the context indicates that treatment with allergenic vaccines (immunotherapy) results in decreased symptoms of allergic rhinitis, decreased development of new allergies, and less asthma in the treated group compared with the untreated control group."

While the context discusses the potential benefits and risks of soy and isoflavones on various health conditions, such as allergic rhinitis, breast cancer, and inflammatory markers, it does not address the specific relationship between soy consumption and acne. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer based solely on the given context. Further research is needed to determine the potential effects of soy and isoflavones on acne."
It is not always possible to reduce elevated cholesterol levels to a healthy level with tablets and thus minimize the risk of heart attack or stroke. Does this succeed through additional injections with PCSK9 antibodies?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"Monoclonal antibodies to PCSK9 have been shown to significantly reduce LDL-C levels by 30-65% in patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia or statin intolerance. These inhibitors have also been associated with a statistically significant reduction in death for any cause and a favorable trend for cardiovascular events. The approved PCSK9 inhibitors, evolocumab and alirocumab, have been very effective in optimizing plasma LDL-C values and reducing CV event risk. Although cardiovascular outcomes trials have not been completed, the available evidence suggests that PCSK9 inhibitors may provide a valuable option for patients who are not satisfactorily managed with statins. Therefore, it is possible to reduce elevated cholesterol levels to a healthy level and minimize the risk of heart attack or stroke through additional injections with PCSK9 antibodies."
Does yoga change the genetic makeup?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The context suggests that yoga may indeed influence genetic makeup. Specifically, it mentions that yoga and related practices result in rapid gene expression alterations. These alterations, which involve changes in the way genes are activated or silenced, may form the basis for yoga's longer-term health effects. The context further discusses a study that assessed rapid changes in global gene expression profiles in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of healthy individuals who practiced a comprehensive yoga program. This indicates that the practice of yoga may have a direct impact on gene expression, and by extension, genetic makeup. However, it's important to note that these changes are likely transient and reversible, and do not involve alterations to the DNA sequence itself."
Can disinfectants containing highly diluted sodium hypochlorite (below 0.1%) render corona and other viruses harmless and thus protect against infection?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,No,No,"The studies indicate that sodium hypochlorite solutions lower than 0.52% were less effective for complete inactivation of poliovirus. A 10.4 log reduction was observed with a 0.63% sodium hypochlorite solution, and a 0.63% chlorine sodium hypochlorite solution effectively reduced the concentration of all poliovirus serotypes by 10 log10. The virucidal activity of chlorine-compounds was studied using hepatitis A virus and poliovirus 2, and sodium hypochlorite solution at 5000 ppm could inactivate feline calicivirus by 3 log(10) plaque forming units after approximately 1.9 minutes of contact time. However, the studies do not provide evidence that disinfectants containing highly diluted sodium hypochlorite (below 0.1%) can render corona and other viruses harmless and thus protect against infection."
Does glucosamine prolong life?,"['True', 'False', 'NEI']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"The context suggests that glucosamine administration has been shown to improve survival rates in various studies. In one study, glucosamine administration significantly increased the survival rate in comparison with mannitol administration in mice (percentage of survival after 2 h, 47% vs. 20%; p < 0.05). In another study, glucosamine administration improved the survival rate after trauma-hemorrhage without resuscitation in rats, which was related to the glucosamine-induced increase in protein o-glycosylation. Furthermore, glucosamine has been shown to inhibit proteasomal activity and the proliferation of prostate cancer cells, which may contribute to its potential life-prolonging effects. However, it is important to note that more research is needed to fully understand the long-term effects of glucosamine on survival and its potential side effects."
Do cesarean babies have a higher risk of asthma and allergies later in life? Do they have an increased risk of type 1 diabetes??,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"Epidemiological studies and meta-analyses have consistently shown an increased risk of asthma and allergies in children born by cesarean section compared to those born through vaginal delivery. The association between cesarean delivery and asthma is particularly strong among children of allergic parents. Additionally, cesarean delivery has been linked to an increased risk of allergic rhinitis and atopy, especially in children with a parental history of asthma or allergies.

     Furthermore, there is evidence to suggest that children born by cesarean section have a higher risk of developing type 1 diabetes. The exact mechanisms underlying these associations are not fully understood, but it is thought that cesarean delivery may alter immune development and delay microbial colonization, which may increase the risk of atopy and asthma."
Are tattoo inks harmful to health?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"Tattoo inks contain a complex mixture of chemical impurities that may pose a long-term risk for human health. The study indicates that currently available tattoo inks contain components that induce adaptive stress response pathways. The biocompatibility of tattoo dyes has not been well researched, and further work is required to understand the toxicokinetics of tattoo ink chemicals in the body. The studied tattoo inks caused effects in all bioassays, with the red and yellow tattoo inks having the greatest response, particularly inducing genotoxicity and oxidative stress response endpoints. Allergic reactions to tattoos are amongst the most common side effects occurring with this permanent deposition of pigments into the dermal skin layer. Tattooing is a tremendous exposure of the human body to needle operation, particles, and chemicals. Decorative tattoo is a popular practice that is generally safe when performed in the professional setting but can be associated with a variety of inflammatory, infectious, and neoplastic complications, risks that may be increased with current trends in home tattooing."

It is an ayurvedic formulation used traditionally to increase vitality, vigor, and delay the aging process. Chyawanprash has been found to have a beneficial effect on memory in aged mice, with a significant improvement in memory after 15 consecutive days of administration. It has also been shown to reduce postprandial glycemia and blood cholesterol levels to a greater extent than vitamin C. Additionally, Chyawanprash has been found to have immunostimulatory effects, with an increase in the secretion of cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-1beta, and macrophage inflammatory protein-1-alpha. Furthermore, Chyawanprash has been shown to decrease free radical generation and increase scavenging of free radicals."
Do vein preparations for external use help with varicose veins or chronic venous insufficiency?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The study suggests that venoactive drugs (VAD), which are used to treat chronic venous disease (CVD), can provide benefits to patients recovering from a surgical or endovenous varicose vein procedure. Varicose veins are a common venous disease of the lower extremity, characterized by incompetent valves, venous reflux, and dilated and tortuous veins. The classic treatment for lower limb varicose veins includes surgery and compressive therapy. The study also investigated whether compression stocking therapy in the human varicose vein wall may change the levels of biomarkers associated with vein insufficiency. The objective of the study was to analyze the benefits of VAD therapy before, during, or after a surgical, endovenous, or sclerotherapy procedure for varicose veins. The study suggests that VAD therapy can help with varicose veins or chronic venous insufficiency."
Is eating genetically modified corn a health concern?,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",NEI,No,No,"The available evidence suggests that genetically modified corn does not pose a significant health concern. In a subchronic dietary study, no immunotoxic activity was detected in rats and mice fed a diet containing genetically modified corn. Similarly, a three-month-long feeding experiment with calves demonstrated no discernible clinical, hematological, biochemical, or ruminal abnormalities in calves fed with a ration containing genetically modified corn. However, it is important to note that the long-term effects of consuming genetically modified corn are not yet fully understood, and further research is needed to fully evaluate its safety. Additionally, the potential for contamination with insecticides and mycotoxins, as well as the impact on the composition and proportions of the cecal microbiota, should be taken into consideration."

However, it does discuss the role of exercise in lowering intraocular pressure, which is a known risk factor for glaucoma. It is also noted that environmentally modifiable factors, such as lifestyle and nutrition, may play a role in glaucoma pathogenesis. While relaxation exercises and stress reduction could potentially be included in these modifiable factors, the context does not provide sufficient information to definitively answer the question. Further research is needed to determine the specific effects of relaxation exercises and stress reduction on glaucoma progression."
Does regular intake of extra virgin olive oil protect against coronary heart disease such as heart attack?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"The data suggests that regular intake of extra virgin olive oil is associated with reduced risks of cardiovascular disease and mortality in individuals at high cardiovascular risk. The protective effects of olive oil against coronary heart disease may be attributed to its richness in monounsaturated fatty acids and anti-inflammatory compounds. A high intake of olive oil has been proposed as an explanation for the low incidence of coronary heart disease in Mediterranean countries. The polyphenol fraction of extra-virgin olive oil may be partly responsible for its cardioprotective effects. In conclusion, olive oil consumption was related to a reduced risk of incident coronary heart disease events."
Does taking arginine benefit existing cardiovascular disease or does arginine prevent it from developing?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The results indicate that L-arginine has been shown to have cardio-protective effects, particularly in ameliorating the deleterious effects of hypercholesterolemia on endothelial function. It has also been found to have anti-inflammatory and metabolic advantages in coronary artery disease patients. L-arginine supplementation has been proposed to improve endogenous nitric oxide regulation in cardiovascular diseases associated with endothelial dysfunction and has been hypothesized to reduce endothelial dysfunction and atherogenesis via increased biosynthesis of nitric oxide. Furthermore, L-arginine has been used to improve endothelial function by increasing nitric oxide bioavailability and has antiatherogenic properties in animal models of atherosclerosis. These findings suggest that L-arginine may benefit existing cardiovascular disease. However, it is important to note that the results do not support the hypothesis that dietary arginine intake lowers the risk of coronary heart disease mortality."
Do heat patches containing capsaicin help with neck pain???,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",No,Yes,Yes,"Capsaicin, a topical agent, has been shown to decrease sensitivity to pain produced by sharp mechanical stimuli and nearly eliminate heat-evoked pain within the injected area. Repeated topical application of capsaicin has resulted in reduced sensation to mechanical, heat, and cold pain without changing non-painful tactile sensation. Capsaicin has been recommended as a treatment for a variety of painful syndromes, including neuropathic pain. Topical creams with capsaicin have been successful for pain relief in postherpetic neuralgia, arthritis, and diabetic neuropathy. Localized neuropathic pain can be relieved following the topical application of high-concentration capsaicin. For this reason, application of capsaicin to the skin has been used for a variety of painful syndromes. Capsaicin, either as repeated application of a low dose cream or a single application of a high dose patch, may provide a degree of pain relief to some patients with painful neuropathic conditions. Therefore, it can be inferred that heat patches containing capsaicin may help with neck pain."
Does Maca help with sexual problems such as erectile dysfunction or sexual aversion in men and women?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The clinical evidence for the effectiveness of the maca plant as a treatment for sexual dysfunction is limited, but there are indications of its potential benefits. Two randomized controlled trials (RCTs) suggested a significant positive effect of maca on sexual dysfunction or sexual desire in healthy menopausal women or healthy adult men, respectively. Another RCT assessed the effects of maca in patients with erectile dysfunction using the International Index of Erectile Dysfunction-5 and showed significant effects. However, one RCT failed to show any effects in healthy cyclists. The results of a systematic review provide limited evidence for the effectiveness of maca in improving sexual function. It is important to note that maca treatment did not produce large changes in male sexual behavior and had no effect on sexual behavior after 21 days of treatment. Nonetheless, the use of maca for generations by people in rural communities in Peru, due to their belief that it improves fertility and sexual desire, suggests its potential as an alternative therapy for sexual dysfunction."
Do sprouts or buds have a healing effect?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The context provided indicates that plants possess a regeneration capacity, which enables them to survive after wounding. This process is facilitated by the sprouting of buds, which becomes apparent by 5-7 days and reaches maximal values by 14-21 days after injury. The nanostructure of plant extracts and their phytochemicals can enhance their bioavailability and control their release, which is necessary for the healing process. Different pharmacological targets are involved in the wound healing effects of herbal-based nanostructures, including the suppression of inflammatory cytokines and the promotion of neovascularization and angiogenic pathways. Wounding triggers organ regeneration in many plant species, and the application of plant hormones, such as auxin and cytokinin, enhances their regenerative capacities in tissue culture. Therefore, it can be concluded that sprouts or buds do have a healing effect."
Do dietary supplements with magnesium and/or zinc improve symptoms in children with ADHD?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The evidence suggests that dietary supplements with magnesium and zinc may improve symptoms in children with ADHD. Studies have shown that children with ADHD may have lower levels of these nutrients, and that supplementation can have a positive effect on symptom severity. However, it is important to note that the evidence is limited, and more research is needed to fully understand the relationship between these nutrients and ADHD. Additionally, it is recommended that any supplementation be done under the guidance of a healthcare provider to ensure safety and effectiveness."
Does the treatment of diabetes-related retinal diseases by injection of VEGF inhibitors provide an advantage compared to conventional laser treatment?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"The treatment of diabetes-related retinal diseases by injection of VEGF inhibitors has been shown to provide an advantage compared to conventional laser treatment. Over a decade of clinical evidence indicates that intravitreal injection of anti-VEGF agents is associated with decreased disease progression and preservation of vision. These agents have become the gold standard treatment for diabetic retinopathy and have shown significant improvement in visual acuity. In addition, intravitreal anti-VEGF treatment with ranibizumab has been found to lead to a significant stabilization or even improvement of diabetic retinopathy. While the primary treatment options remain laser photocoagulation and anti-VEGF intravitreal injections, the latter has been found to be beneficial in cases with neovascular glaucoma, persistent vitreous hemorrhage, and before vitrectomy. However, it is important to note that each intravitreal injection of these agents carries a small risk of endophthalmitis, which can be visually devastating."
Can acupuncture for labor induction trigger the onset of labor?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",No,Yes,Yes,"Justification: The present study suggested that acupuncture applied at term of pregnancy seems to be effective in reducing the rate of labor induction which is performed for prolonged pregnancy at 41 + 5 weeks. The rate of labor induction significantly differed between acupuncture and observation groups (19.6% vs. 38%; p < 0.01); in particular, women receiving acupuncture showed a lower rate of induction, indicating prolonged pregnancy (5.3% vs. 10.1%; p < 0.01). Traditional Chinese medicine advocates the use of acupuncture to soften the cervix and induce uterine contractions. Women receiving acupuncture showed a trend to deliver earlier than women in the observation group (p < 0.09). These findings suggest that acupuncture can trigger the onset of labor."
"Can a supposedly ""high acid"" diet weaken bones?","['True', 'NEI', 'False']",No,Yes,Yes,"The evidence suggests that a high acid-producing diet can have detrimental effects on bone health. This type of diet generates increased urinary acid and calcium excretion, which can lead to a slight, but significant, metabolic acidosis. This metabolic acidosis may result in greater loss of bone mineral and increased potential for fractures. Acidosis-induced increases in cortisol secretion and plasma concentration may also play a role in alterations in bone metabolism and osteoporosis. Furthermore, a chronic net dietary acid load may have adverse consequences on bone, including increased bone resorption and decreased bone formation. However, it is important to note that sufficient calcium intake might neutralize this effect."
Is the risk of bacterial or fungal infection comparable when using menstrual cups or pads?,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",Yes,No,No,"The risk of bacterial or fungal infection is not comparable when using menstrual cups or pads. The literature review indicates that menstrual cups have been associated with cases of toxic shock syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition caused by bacterial toxins. In contrast, there is no reported evidence of toxic shock syndrome associated with the use of pads. Furthermore, the study on the microbiological profile of drainage fluid from closed-suction drains and the development of surgical-site infections (SSIs) in breast reconstruction surgery suggests that the use of menstrual cups may increase the risk of bacterial or fungal infections. However, it is important to note that the risk of infection with menstrual cups can be minimized by proper cleaning and handling of the cup. In conclusion, while both menstrual cups and pads are viable options for menstrual management, the risk of bacterial or fungal infection is not comparable between the two."

It also mentions the diuretic effects of certain herbs and their potential to relieve symptoms of urinary tract infections. However, it does not provide a direct comparison between the effectiveness of these herbal remedies and antibiotics in treating cystitis. Therefore, it is not possible to definitively state whether herbal remedies with nasturtium and horseradish alleviate the symptoms of cystitis as well as an antibiotic."
Does chicken soup help with colds?,"['True', 'False', 'NEI']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The context suggests that chicken soup may contain a number of substances with beneficial medicinal activity, including a mild anti-inflammatory effect. This effect could potentially mitigate symptomatic upper respiratory tract infections, such as those associated with colds. The study found that chicken soup significantly inhibited neutrophil migration, a key process in inflammation, in a concentration-dependent manner. This indicates that chicken soup may have a therapeutic effect in reducing inflammation, which is a common symptom of colds. However, the nutrients in the soup, mainly soluble protein, are relatively low, which may limit its nutritional value. Nonetheless, the anti-inflammatory effect of chicken soup could still provide some relief from cold symptoms."
Does arthroscopy (joint endoscopy) help with osteoarthritis of the knee joint?,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",No,NEI,NEI,"The effectiveness of arthroscopy for the treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee remains a subject of debate. While some studies suggest that arthroscopic treatment regimens can improve function and activity levels in patients with moderate to severe osteoarthritis, others have found limited evidence-based research to support the use of arthroscopy as a treatment method for osteoarthritis of the knee. The benefits of arthroscopy for the treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee are thought to be subjective pain relief, potentially via a placebo effect. However, it is unclear how the procedure achieves this result. Despite the lack of consensus guidelines and randomized control trials, the use of arthroscopy for the treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee has increased over the last decade. However, recent literature suggests that knee arthroscopy in the setting of osteoarthritis is no better than placebo. Therefore, it is not possible to definitively conclude that arthroscopy (joint endoscopy) helps with osteoarthritis of the knee joint."
Does sugar consumption increase the risk of developing type 2 diabetes regardless of obesity?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"The context suggests that sugar consumption is associated with an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes, independent of its role in obesity. This is supported by several studies that have found a positive association between sugar-sweetened soft drink intake and type 2 diabetes risk, even after adjusting for BMI. Additionally, experimental data suggest that sugars could play a role in cancer etiology through inflammatory and oxidative mechanisms and insulin resistance, even in the absence of weight gain. However, it is important to note that the included studies were observational, so their results should be interpreted cautiously."
Can green tea reduce the likelihood of dying from cancer ?,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",No,NEI,NEI,"The context suggests that green tea consumption is associated with a reduced risk of certain types of cancers and a lower risk of several types of human carcinomas. However, it does not provide direct evidence or information on whether green tea can reduce the likelihood of dying from cancer. The context primarily focuses on the potential cancer-preventive effects of green tea, such as scavenging oxidative radicals, inhibition of tumor initiation, and modulation of detoxification enzymes. While these mechanisms may contribute to a reduced risk of cancer, the context does not establish a clear link between green tea consumption and a decreased likelihood of dying from cancer. Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to definitively answer the question."
Does Almased help with excess weight better than other diets?,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",NEI,NEI,NEI,"The context does not provide information on the specific diet known as Almased. However, it does indicate that various diets, including those with almonds and low-fat diets, have been shown to aid in weight loss. The DASH diet, in particular, has been found to be effective for weight management, especially in overweight and obese individuals. The context also emphasizes that all diets can work when adhered to and that initial weight loss can predict the amount of weight lost and maintained for up to four years. Therefore, without specific information on Almased, it is not possible to determine if it is more effective for weight loss than other diets."
Do the components of the Moringa oleifera tree have a positive effect on health?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The components of the Moringa oleifera tree have been found to have a positive effect on health. This tropical plant is known for its high nutritional and medicinal value, with its leaves being particularly beneficial. The plant contains essential amino acids, carotenoids, and components with nutraceutical properties. It is also appreciated for its high content of phytochemicals.

The plant has been found to be beneficial in several chronic conditions, including hypercholesterolemia, high blood pressure, diabetes, insulin resistance, non-alcoholic liver disease, cancer, and overall inflammation. It is also being studied for its nutritional value and total phenolic content."
Is exercise an effective measure to combat depression?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"Exercise has been shown to be an effective treatment for depression. It has been well-established as a treatment for depression, with both consumers and clinicians supporting its use in clinical care. Exercise has been found to be an efficacious treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD) and has been shown to have anti-inflammatory effects in non-depressed subjects. Studies have shown that exercise of any intensity can significantly improve feelings of depression, and it has been found to be associated with a greater reduction in depression symptoms compared to no treatment, placebo, or active control interventions such as relaxation or meditation. Exercise has also been studied as a potential antidepressant, with most studies supporting its efficacy. The use of exercise as a symptom management tool to improve mood in depression has been recommended, with even light exercise being an effective recommendation. The efficacy of physical exercise as an augmentation to pharmacotherapy with antidepressants for depressive patients has been documented. Exercise has also been shown to improve cardiorespiratory fitness and reduce depressive symptoms in people with depression."
Does early detection of lung cancer by trained sniffer dogs provide significant benefits to those affected?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"Justification: The context suggests that trained sniffer dogs have shown promising results in detecting lung cancer, including early-stage cancer. The dogs' ability to perceive volatile organic compounds (VOCs) related to cancer, thanks to their highly developed olfactory systems, has been reported in several studies. The accuracy of canine scent detection was found to be high even for early cancer. Therefore, it can be inferred that early detection of lung cancer by trained sniffer dogs could provide significant benefits to those affected, potentially leading to earlier intervention and improved outcomes."
Does light freezing help with weight loss?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The scientific literature suggests that cryolipolysis, a noninvasive technique for the reduction of subcutaneous adipose tissue by controlled, localized cooling, can aid in weight loss. This process causes adipocyte apoptosis, or the death of fat cells, without affecting surrounding tissue. The technique has been shown to produce a marked decrease in mechanical and thermal pain sensitivity. Furthermore, studies have indicated that intentional weight loss among obese persons significantly improves physiologic variables. While the precise pathogenesis of paradoxical adipose hyperplasia, a rare side effect of cryolipolysis, is poorly understood, the technique has a low incidence of adverse side effects. Therefore, it can be inferred that light freezing, as a form of cryolipolysis, can contribute to weight loss."
Is combined hormone therapy with estrogen and progestin safe for women in late menopause (after the last menstrual period)?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",No,Yes,Yes,", but with caveats.

     Combined hormone therapy with estrogen and progestin can be safe for women in late menopause, but it is important to note that there are safety and tolerability concerns associated with this treatment. While estrogen, with or without a progestin, is effective for the treatment of menopausal symptoms, the use of unopposed estrogens has been linked to an increased risk of endometrial cancer. As a result, many women opt for combined estrogen-progestogen therapy instead. However, prolonged use of sequential hormone replacement therapy with estrogen combined with progestogen for 10 to 24 days per month may elevate the risk of endometrial cancer relative to those who have never received hormone replacement therapy. It is also important to note that the use of estrogens in postmenopausal women has been the subject of much controversy regarding hormone formulation, dosage, use in combination with progestins, duration of treatment, and contraindications. Therefore, it is crucial to consult with a healthcare provider to determine the most appropriate treatment plan for individual needs and circumstances."
"Can chlorhexidine in the form of mouth rinses and gels for home use in children and adults, and as a dental varnish in children, prevent the formation of caries?","['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"Chlorhexidine, in the form of mouth rinses and gels, has been shown to be an effective agent in preventing the formation of caries in both children and adults. Its use as a topical oral antiseptic is well-documented, and it has been proven to have anticaries activity. Chlorhexidine has been used successfully to prevent new carious lesions in the teeth of both adults and children. It is also widely used as a mouth rinse in the prevention and treatment of periodontal diseases and dental caries. The use of chlorhexidine gel has been shown to strongly reduce caries development in the abutment teeth under overdentures. Furthermore, chlorhexidine varnish and gel applications have been shown to significantly suppress mutans streptococci, a type of bacteria that contributes to the formation of caries, on the abutment teeth for four and eight weeks, respectively. In conclusion, chlorhexidine, in the form of mouth rinses and gels, can be considered an effective agent in preventing the formation of caries in both children and adults."
Is breaking an energy-saving lamp harmful to health?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"Justification: The context indicates that the use of unfiltered quartz-halogen lamps exposes human skin to radiation that spans much of the ultraviolet (UV) spectrum. This suggests that breaking an energy-saving lamp, which may contain mercury and emit UV radiation, could pose a health risk. Furthermore, the lamp must be disposed of at the end of its lifetime or following damage due to physical shock or vibration. This implies that breaking the lamp could release harmful substances into the environment, potentially causing harm to human health. Therefore, it is important to handle and dispose of energy-saving lamps properly to minimize the risk of exposure to harmful radiation and substances."
Does melatonin help against jet lag?,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"Melatonin has been shown to have therapeutic potential for alleviating jet lag. Its circadian effects in humans have led to its use in treating jet lag and circadian-based sleep disorders. The hormone melatonin, produced by the pineal gland, plays a role in maintaining sleep-wake rhythms and can help regulate sleep disturbances associated with jet lag. Both field and simulated studies have demonstrated that appropriately timed melatonin can improve sleep and hasten the readaptation of circadian rhythms following a phase shift. Furthermore, recent studies support the use of melatonin as a remedy for jet lag on long-haul flights. Melatonin has been shown to significantly reduce sleep-onset latency, improve mood, and improve daytime functioning. It has also been found to improve the quality and depth of nighttime sleep, reduce the number of nighttime awakenings, and increase the duration of sleep without producing a morning hangover. Therefore, it can be concluded that melatonin is helpful in alleviating jet lag."
Does virgin conception exist?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,No,No,"The context provided discusses various aspects of premarital virginity, conception, and fertilization. However, it does not provide evidence to support the existence of virgin conception, which would imply conception without sexual intercourse. The context specifically mentions that conception occurs through the fertilization of an ovum by a sperm, a process that typically requires sexual intercourse. The case studies and research findings presented in the context do not suggest or imply the possibility of virgin conception. Therefore, based on the information provided, it can be concluded that virgin conception does not exist."

Probiotics may prevent this type of diarrhea by restoring the gut microflora and normalizing an unbalanced gastrointestinal flora. Several studies have demonstrated the benefits of probiotics in treating various diarrheal disorders, including antibiotic-associated diarrhea. However, it is important to note that the evidence supporting the use of probiotics for this purpose is limited to certain microorganisms. Therefore, while probiotics may be useful in preventing diarrhea after treatment with antibiotics, further research is needed to confirm their efficacy and determine the most effective strains and dosages."
Do you get a stomach ache if you eat cherries or other stone fruit and then drink water?,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",NEI,NEI,NEI,"The provided context does not explicitly state whether consuming cherries or other stone fruits and then drinking water leads to stomach aches. However, it does mention that ingestion of certain fruits, including mango, persimmon, and grapes, can cause abdominal distention and excessive flatus, while other fruits like apricots and melon do not. The context also discusses the potential for acidic fruits to cause gastrointestinal symptoms, such as heartburn and epigastric pain, and the correlation between gastrointestinal symptoms and the ingestion of sugars such as sorbitol and fructose. It also mentions that incomplete absorption of carbohydrates, particularly fructose, from apple juice can contribute to chronic diarrhea in young children. However, the context does not specifically address the question of whether consuming cherries or other stone fruits and then drinking water leads to stomach aches. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer based on the provided context."
Is a vegetarian diet including eggs and dairy products healthier than a diet that includes meat?,"['True', 'False', 'NEI']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"A vegetarian diet that includes eggs and dairy products, also known as a lacto-ovo-vegetarian diet, is generally considered healthier than a diet that includes meat. This is due to the fact that vegetarian diets are associated with lower intakes of energy, saturated fatty acids, and animal protein, and higher intakes of fiber and phytochemicals, compared to omnivorous diets. The consumption of plant proteins rather than animal proteins by vegetarians may contribute to their reduced risk of chronic diseases such as diabetes and heart disease. Additionally, vegetarian diets are usually rich in carbohydrates, n-6 fatty acids, dietary fiber, carotenoids, folic acid, vitamin C, vitamin E, and magnesium, and relatively low in protein, saturated fat, long-chain n-3 fatty acids, retinol, vitamin B(12) and zinc. While meat intake has been related to increased risk for a variety of chronic diseases, an abundant consumption of vegetables, fruits, cereals, nuts, and legumes all have been independently related with a lower risk for several chronic degenerative diseases, such as ischemic heart disease, diabetes, obesity, and many cancers."
Can plant sterols or foods with them reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"Justification: The consumption of plant sterols or stanols has been shown to reduce serum total and LDL-cholesterol concentrations, which is associated with decreased atherosclerotic risk and potentially reduced risk of coronary heart disease. Plant sterol-enriched foods are an effective dietary adjuvant in reducing cardiovascular risk and provide a relatively cheap, safe, and effective way to help patients manage their cardiovascular risk. Epidemiological data also show that individuals with higher intakes of plant sterols from their habitual diets have lower serum-cholesterol levels. Therefore, the consumption of dietary plant sterols should be a part of dietary advice to patients with hypercholesterolemia and the general public for the prevention and management of coronary heart disease."
Can arthroscopy reduce pain or improve mobility?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",No,Yes,Yes,"Arthroscopy has been shown to be beneficial in reducing pain and improving mobility in patients with intra-articular pathology, including osteoarthritis and articular cartilage disease. In cases of anterior impingement syndrome, arthroscopic treatment can effectively manage pain and loss of range of motion. In patients with inflammatory arthropathies, arthroscopy with associated debridement and synovectomy can relieve pain, improve function, and delay progression of the disease. Arthroscopy has also emerged as a viable therapeutic option for glenohumeral arthritis when nonoperative measures fail. However, it is important to note that the role of arthroscopy in the treatment of glenohumeral arthritis is still evolving, and it may not be effective in all cases. Additionally, arthroscopy is more effective in combination with additional procedures in younger patients, more active patients, and patients with less severe disease or smaller lesions. In cases where there is no mechanical damage to the knee, nonsurgical, conservative methods may be more appropriate. Overall, arthroscopy can be an effective tool in reducing pain and improving mobility in certain patients with intra-articular pathology."
Does yoga reduce the impairment in everyday life caused by persistent (chronic) back pain?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"The context suggests that yoga has been shown to be an effective therapy for chronic low back pain, with numerous benefits in various chronic painful conditions. Yoga has been found to improve pain reduction and quality of life in nonspecific chronic back pain compared to general exercise. Additionally, yoga has been shown to decrease disability among people with pain, with significant reductions in pain at 4 to 8 weeks, 3 months, and 6 to 7 months compared to non-exercise. The possible mechanism of yoga is to refine brain-grounded maps of the body, which are disrupted in chronic pain. Yoga has also been shown to improve autonomic function and enhance quality of life in people with chronic pain. Therefore, it can be inferred that yoga reduces the impairment in everyday life caused by persistent (chronic) back pain."
Can dementia be prevented by years of orange juice consumption?,"['False', 'True', 'NEI']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The present findings suggest that frequent citrus consumption, including orange juice, was associated with a lower risk of incident dementia. Chronic daily consumption of flavanone-rich 100% orange juice over 8 weeks has been shown to be beneficial for cognitive function in healthy older adults. Additionally, a high habitual consumption of some specific fruits and vegetables, including orange juice, may diminish age-related cognitive decline in middle-aged individuals. Furthermore, a 12-week randomized controlled trial assessed cognitive outcomes in older adults with mild-to-moderate dementia after consumption of 200 ml/day of either a cherry juice or a control juice with negligible anthocyanin content, and found that inclusion of an anthocyanin-rich beverage may improve specific cognitive outcomes. These findings suggest that regular consumption of orange juice may have a preventive effect against cognitive impairment and dementia."
Do omega-3 fatty acids or a diet rich in fish help with rheumatoid arthritis?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The consumption of omega-3 fatty acids, particularly those found in fish oil and oily fish, has been shown to have beneficial effects on inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis. Epidemiological studies suggest that a diet high in marine fatty acids may have a preventive and therapeutic effect in rheumatoid arthritis. Consumption of n-3 fatty acids has been shown to improve clinical parameters of disease activity and reduce levels of inflammatory markers in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. While the mechanism of their anti-inflammatory effect is not fully understood, it is thought to be related to their ability to interfere with the body's inflammatory response."
Can matrix therapy (also: matrix rhythm therapy) alleviate complaints of muscles and joints?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The context suggests that matrix therapy, a minimally invasive approach in regenerative medicine, aims to promote tissue regeneration by reconstructing the cellular microenvironment following tissue injury. This therapy has been observed to have beneficial effects on pain in patients with knee osteoarthritis, which are not explained by a placebo effect. Furthermore, evidence from animal studies indicates that matrix augmentation of bone marrow stimulation can improve the quality of repair tissue formation.

Can fructose damage the liver?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"Excessive intake of fructose has been implicated in the development of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Fructose is metabolized primarily in the liver, and its consumption has been shown to increase circulating alanine transaminase, a marker of liver damage. Fructose intake has also been associated with metabolic alterations, liver fibrosis, and inflammation. Fructose consumption can lead to hepatic lipid accumulation and the development of fatty liver disease. Additionally, fructose has been shown to produce hepatic insulin resistance in humans and animals. While the exact mechanisms are not fully understood, it is clear that excessive fructose intake can have negative effects on liver health."
Does ointment with comfrey help with ankle sprains and sore muscles???,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The efficacy of an ointment containing comfrey extract for the treatment of unilateral acute ankle sprains has been confirmed in a double-blind, multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, group comparison study. Multiple randomized controlled trials have demonstrated the efficacy and safety of comfrey preparations for the topical treatment of pain, inflammation, and swelling of muscles and joints. In a prospective, multicentre, randomised, blinded, active-control and non-inferiority study, comfrey-based ointment and gel decreased pain and improved joint function to the same extent as diclofenac gel in acute ankle sprain, and were well tolerated. Comfrey has anti-inflammatory, analgesic and tissue regenerating properties, making it a valuable therapy option for the treatment of painful muscle and joint complaints."
Can capsules with diamine oxidase alleviate or prevent symptoms of histamine intolerance?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The study indicates that the oral administration of diamine oxidase (DAO) has been proposed to treat certain gastrointestinal dysfunctions induced by histamine. Histamine intolerance is a disorder caused by a reduced intestinal degradation of histamine, mainly due to a deficiency in the DAO enzyme. The intake of DAO demonstrated a statistically significant reduction of histamine-associated symptoms compared to placebo (p = 0.014). Furthermore, a deficit of DAO activity can lead to the appearance of histamine intolerance, a clinical condition that may be treated by a low-histamine diet and oral DAO supplementation to enhance intestinal histamine degradation. Therefore, it can be inferred that capsules with diamine oxidase can alleviate or prevent symptoms of histamine intolerance."
Do special garments with the active ingredient Liporeductyl help against cellulite?,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",NEI,NEI,NEI,"The provided context does not mention the active ingredient Liporeductyl or any special garments as a treatment for cellulite. Therefore, it is not possible to determine if these garments are effective against cellulite based on the given information. The context discusses various treatments for cellulite, including topical products, low-level laser therapy, and vacuum-assisted precise tissue release. However, the effectiveness of these treatments is not directly related to the use of special garments with Liporeductyl. Further research and evidence are required to determine the efficacy of these garments in reducing the appearance of cellulite."
Do unsaturated fats (from plants and fish) reduce cardiovascular disease compared to saturated fats (from meat and dairy products)?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"Numerous studies have indicated that diets high in unsaturated fatty acids, particularly polyunsaturated fats, are associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular disease. These fats, which include omega-3 fatty acids found in fish and certain plant sources, have been shown to decrease blood cholesterol concentrations and reduce atherosclerosis more effectively than diets high in saturated or even monounsaturated fats. The consumption of omega-3 fatty acids, in particular, has been linked to lower rates of cardiovascular disease in epidemiological studies. These fatty acids, found in fish and fish oils, have been shown to protect against coronary heart disease and are inversely associated with cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality. Diets enriched with omega-3 polyunsaturated fish oils have been associated with a lower risk of atherosclerotic vascular disease. In contrast, diets high in saturated fats, typically found in meat and dairy products, have been linked to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease."
Do heat patches that heat themselves or heat pads help with pain in the neck?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The application of heat has been shown to significantly decrease subjective pain in patients with neck pain, as compared to sham groups. This is supported by a study that found a greater change in pain levels in the heat group compared to the sham group (p= 0.002, d= 0.81). The use of heat for pain relief is a commonly accepted method and is recommended as a first-line therapy in many clinical guidelines. The effect of local heat on trigger points of the body has been found to be significantly better in the heat groups than in the sham groups. High-level pulsed heat (45°C) has also been found to produce significantly more analgesia as compared to steady heat at 37°C. The application of heat has been found to induce mental relaxation and ameliorate neck stiffness by modifying activity of the admpfc. However, there are still questions that remain about the actual effectiveness of heat for a condition as common as chronic low back pain, and factors such as time of onset, optimal temperature, and duration of effect."
Does gargling with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) help against coronavirus or others in throat infections?,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",NEI,No,No,"The systematic review of the literature indicates that there is no scientific evidence supporting the use of hydrogen peroxide mouthwash for controlling the viral load of SARS-CoV-2 or any other viruses in saliva. Although hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is a ""green chemical"" with various cleaning and disinfectant uses, including as an anti-bacterial agent for hygienic and medical treatments, its virucidal effect has not been established. The peroxidase-halide-hydrogen peroxide system may contribute to the host defense against certain viral infections, but its efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 has not been demonstrated. Therefore, it is not recommended to use hydrogen peroxide mouthwash as a preventive or therapeutic measure against coronavirus or other throat infections."
Can healing clay help with gastritis?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The beneficial effects of clay minerals on the gastrointestinal mucosa are associated with two mechanisms of action: (1) adsorption of the aggressors or their toxic secretions and (2) modification of the thickness and rheological properties of the adherent mucus, reinforcing the natural defenses of the gastrointestinal mucosa. The highly adsorptive properties of many clays may contribute to healing a variety of ailments, although they are not antibacterial. The use of healing clays for therapeutic purposes has been traditionally used by man for maintaining body health or treating some diseases. The effects of clay ingestion by humans and animals, such as gastrointestinal wellness and the increase in food efficiency are well known, although the underlying mechanisms are not yet fully understood."
Do general health checkups lead to longer life?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",No,Yes,Yes,", with caveats

     Justification: The context suggests that the benefits of general health checkups, including periodic health examinations, can lead to health benefits for elderly persons. The earlier detection of disease may result in more cures or longer survival. Compared with no follow-up, the current schedule showed a gain in life expectancy with a range from 0.3 years to 1.5 years that decreased with advancing age. However, it is important to note that the benefits of health checkups depend on the individual's general health and life expectancy. Additionally, there is little information to indicate whether frequent visits to the doctor's office or frequent testing improves survival or quality of life. Therefore, while general health checkups can lead to longer life, it is not a guarantee and depends on various factors."
Can glutamate in food cause intolerance symptoms?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"Glutamate, a popular food additive, has been associated with various adverse effects, including the potential to cause intolerance symptoms. As a crucial neurotransmitter in the mammalian central nervous system, glutamate plays a significant role in nociceptive processing and has been linked to hyperalgesia and central sensitization. Furthermore, glutamate is the most frequently encountered food excitotoxin, capable of penetrating certain brain regions and rapidly destroying neurons by hyperactivating the NMDA subtype of glutamate receptors.

     Several reports have correlated monosodium glutamate (MSG) consumption with a series of unwanted reactions, including headaches and mechanical sensitivity in pericranial muscles. These findings suggest that glutamate in food can indeed cause intolerance symptoms in certain individuals. However, it is essential to note that the severity and specific symptoms may vary among individuals due to factors such as enzyme deficiencies, pharmacological effects, and genetic patterns."
Can Neuro-Socks relieve pain or improve balance and stability?,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",NEI,NEI,NEI,"The context does not provide specific information on the efficacy of Neuro-Socks in relieving pain or improving balance and stability. However, it does mention the potential benefits of peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS) in managing chronic pain in various conditions, such as neuropathic pain, chronic headache, pelvic and perineal pain, and low back pain. The context also highlights the potential success of novel devices specifically designed to target the peripheral nervous system in promoting the use of PNS in the treatment of chronic pain. Nevertheless, it is important to note that the evidence for the efficacy of PNS is not strongly conclusive, and large-scale randomized controlled studies are necessary to confirm its long-term efficacy. Therefore, without specific information on the mechanism of action and clinical evidence supporting the use of Neuro-Socks, it is not possible to determine whether they can relieve pain or improve balance and stability."
,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The context suggests that coconut oil has been the subject of several studies aimed at alleviating Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. Coconut oil contains large amounts of medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs) and its consumption is thought to stimulate hepatic ketogenesis, providing an alternative energy source for brains with impaired glucose metabolism. After intervention with coconut oil, improvements in episodic, temporal orientation, and semantic memory were observed, with the positive effect being more evident in women with mild-moderate AD. Furthermore, a pilot study investigated the effects of coconut oil supplementation directly on cortical neurons treated with amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide in vitro, and the results suggest that coconut oil intake may improve brain health by directly activating ketogenesis in astrocytes and providing fuel to neighboring neurons. Therefore, the context supports the claim that taking coconut oil may improve mental abilities in dementia like Alzheimer's disease."
Can probiotics lower blood sugar in type 2 diabetes?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"The available evidence suggests that probiotics can have a beneficial effect on glycemic control in type 2 diabetes. Clinical trials have shown that probiotic supplementation significantly decreased fasting blood glucose and hemoglobin A1c in diabetic patients. The modulation of the gut microbiota by probiotics has been proposed as a potential mechanism for these effects, as type 2 diabetes has been associated with dysbiosis. The regular ingestion of probiotics, particularly lactobacilli, has been proposed as a new strategy for the prevention or control of diabetes. However, more clinical studies with adequate sample sizes and sound methodology are required to inform the development of evidence-based treatment guidelines."
Can labor pain during childbirth be relieved by aromatherapy with lavender oil?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"The use of aromatherapy, specifically with lavender oil, has been shown to be effective in reducing pain and anxiety during labor. Inhalation of lavender scent has been found to be an effective part of a multidisciplinary approach to pain management after cesarean section. Additionally, research has shown that aromatherapy administered during labor reduces anxiety in mothers. Anecdotal evidence also suggests that some women find lavender oil effective at relieving symptoms associated with perineal trauma following childbirth. Furthermore, a study found that lavender oil inhalation reduced pain and anxiety during trigger point injection and improved patient comfort. Therefore, it can be concluded that labor pain during childbirth can be relieved by aromatherapy with lavender oil."
Are home coronavirus self-tests as reliable as tests performed by trained healthcare professionals?,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",NEI,NEI,NEI,"Justification: The context does not provide direct information on the reliability of home coronavirus self-tests compared to tests performed by trained healthcare professionals. However, it does mention that home-based self-sampling for HPV detection showed good concordance with general practitioner (GP) sampling, and that home sample collection tests for HIV infection are available. It also highlights the importance of eHealth techniques to monitor patients at home during the coronavirus pandemic. Nevertheless, without specific data on the accuracy and reliability of home coronavirus self-tests, it is not possible to definitively answer the question."
Does skipping breakfast increase heart attack risk?,"['True', 'False', 'NEI']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The evidence suggests that skipping breakfast is associated with an increased risk of heart disease. A meta-analysis of epidemiological studies found that skipping breakfast was associated with a significantly increased risk of heart disease (pooled HR/OR 1.24; 95% CI 1.09 to 1.40; p = 0.001). Additionally, skipping breakfast has been linked to cardiometabolic risk factors such as obesity, high blood pressure, unfavorable lipid profiles, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome, all of which are known to increase the risk of heart disease. Furthermore, skipping breakfast has been associated with an increased prevalence of noncoronary and generalized atherosclerosis, which is a major risk factor for heart disease. Therefore, it can be concluded that skipping breakfast increases the risk of heart disease, including heart attacks."
,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",Yes,No,No,"The evidence suggests that children born in the last decade of the 20th century are healthier and living longer than children born earlier this century. Additionally, children born too small or too soon are now more likely to reach adulthood than similar children born 10 or 20 years ago. While there are concerns about the impact of the global childhood obesity epidemic on the life expectancy of the current generation, the evidence does not support the claim that today's children have a shorter life expectancy than their parents."
Does goji help with serious diseases like cancer or prevent heart attacks?,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",NEI,NEI,NEI,"The context provided discusses the properties of ginseng, a traditional Chinese medicine, and its potential benefits in treating various diseases, including cancer and cardiovascular diseases. However, it does not provide specific information on the effects of goji (lycium barbarum l.) on serious diseases like cancer or heart attacks. Therefore, it is not possible to definitively state whether goji helps with these conditions based on the given context. Further research and evidence are needed to determine the potential benefits of goji in treating or preventing serious diseases."
Is less eaten from red plates?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"The study indicates that the average total energy intake was significantly lower when food was served on red plates (1102.16 ± 47.12 kcal) compared to black plates (1113.19 ± 47.12 kcal) and white plates (945.72 ± 47.12 kcal). This suggests that plate color, specifically red, may have an effect on reducing food consumption. However, the underlying mechanism for this effect remains unclear. The results also showed that plate color had a significant effect on food intake during the test days (p = 0.021). The study also revealed that the effect of red plates on food consumption was not due to a decrease in the consciously experienced appeal of products on red plates, as overall appreciation of the foods did not differ according to plate color."
Can chlorhexidine in the form of dental varnish prevent the formation of caries in adults?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",No,Yes,Yes,"Chlorhexidine, in the form of dental varnish, has been shown to have potential in preventing the formation of caries in adults. Chlorhexidine varnishes have been primarily used for caries prevention in high-risk populations. The professional application of a chlorhexidine varnish has been found to significantly improve gingival health. Chlorhexidine, as a cationic antimicrobial agent, prevents gingivitis by inhibiting plaque accumulation. It has been used successfully to prevent new carious lesions in the teeth of adults and children. However, it is important to note that the long-term clinical evidence for caries prevention is currently lacking, and reported side effects should be considered. Therefore, while chlorhexidine varnish may have a role in caries prevention, further research is needed to fully understand its long-term effectiveness and safety."
,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",NEI,NEI,NEI,"The context does not provide information on the use of cat's claw for the treatment of degenerative joint disease in cats. Therefore, it is not possible to determine if cat's claw improves joint disease symptoms based on the provided information. Further research is needed to evaluate the efficacy of cat's claw in treating degenerative joint disease in cats."
Do phthalates affect semen quality in men?,"['True', 'False', 'NEI']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"The evidence suggests that phthalate exposure, including exposure from prescription drugs, may have a negative impact on semen quality in men. Studies have shown associations between phthalate exposure and altered semen quality parameters, such as decreased semen volume, sperm curvilinear velocity, and straight-line velocity, as well as an increased percentage of abnormal sperm heads and tails. These findings have been observed in both infertile men seeking care and in the general population. The results of these studies support the hypothesis that phthalate exposure may impair human semen quality."
Does aromatherapy have a calming effect on agitation and aggression typical of dementia?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The use of aromatherapy, particularly with lavender oil, has been shown to have a calming effect on agitated behaviours in patients with dementia. Studies have demonstrated that aromatherapy may reduce the behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD), improve quality of care, and thus improve the quality of life for people with dementia. A single-blinded randomised controlled trial found that clinical aromatherapy was clinically safe and had a modest efficacy in the treatment of agitated behaviour in patients with severe dementia. However, further studies are needed to assess the benefits of aroma-acupressure and aromatherapy for the treatment of agitation in dementia patients."
Does biotin help with hair loss? Does biotin make hair grow faster?,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"Biotin, a water-soluble B-vitamin, has been marketed to improve the cosmetic appearance of hair, skin, and nails. Although the frequency of its deficiency in patients with hair loss has not been established, biotin supplementation has been found to be of benefit in cases of acquired and inherited causes of biotin deficiency as well as pathologies, such as brittle nail syndrome or uncombable hair. In a study, at 6 months in the experimental group, daily hair loss decreased, vertex and frontal hair density increased, thickness of vertex and frontal hair increased, and hair growth rate was 16.17 ± 1.89 mm/month. These findings suggest that biotin may help with hair loss and make hair grow faster. However, it is important to note that research demonstrating the efficacy of biotin is limited and further studies are needed to confirm these findings."
"Does taking supplements with omega-3 fatty acids reduce the risk of heart attack, stroke or other sudden cardiovascular problems?  Does it lower the risk of dying prematurely?","['True', 'NEI', 'False']",No,Yes,Yes,"The context suggests that dietary supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids significantly reduces the risk of cardiovascular deaths, sudden cardiac death, all-cause mortality, and nonfatal cardiovascular events. The reduction in risk is attributed to the prevention of fatal arrhythmias and the positive effects of omega-3 fatty acids on the cardiovascular system, including heart rate reduction. Observational and clinical trial evidence indicates an inverse association between omega-3 fatty acid intake and the risk of cardiovascular disease development/mortality and sudden cardiac death. The detailed mechanisms remain to be elucidated, but high intake of n-3 fatty acids is associated with reduced mortality in patients with ischemic heart disease, especially sudden cardiac death. Therefore, the context supports the claim that taking supplements with omega-3 fatty acids reduces the risk of heart attack, stroke, or other sudden cardiovascular problems and lowers the risk of dying prematurely."
Does mammography screening reduce the risk of dying from breast cancer in certain age groups?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"Mammography screening has been shown to reduce mortality from breast cancer in women aged 50 to 69 years, with a reduction in risk of about 23% to 30%. This is supported by randomized controlled trials and is widely accepted. The benefit is less pronounced in women aged 40 to 49 years, with a reduction in risk of about 16% after 10 years of screening. However, the absolute number of deaths prevented by screening in this age group is much less than in older women due to the lower incidence of breast cancer and the smaller and delayed potential benefit. Women in their 70s may also have a small benefit from screening mammography, but overdiagnosis and competing causes of death increase in this age group. Therefore, mammography screening reduces the risk of dying from breast cancer in certain age groups, with the greatest benefit seen in women aged 50 to 69 years."
Are weather phenomena and weather changes triggers of migraine attacks?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The scientific literature indicates that weather phenomena and weather changes can indeed act as triggers for migraine attacks. Studies have found that a subgroup of migraineurs is highly sensitive to changes in certain weather components, and a significant weather sensitivity could be observed in this subgroup. Specific meteorological variables, such as temperature changes, relative humidity, and barometric pressure, have been found to correlate with the prevalence and intensity of migraine attacks. For instance, higher relative humidity has been associated with higher odds of migraine headache onset in the warm season, while traffic-related gaseous pollutants may be associated with higher odds of migraine headache onset in the cold season. However, it is important to note that the specific weather component(s) responsible for triggering migraine attacks have yielded inconsistent results, and more research is needed to fully understand the relationship between weather and migraine."
Does PrEP reduce the risk of HIV infection?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",Yes,Yes,Yes,".

     Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) has been shown to be effective in reducing the risk of HIV infection. Multiple randomized controlled trials have demonstrated that daily oral PrEP significantly decreases the risk of HIV acquisition in high-risk individuals, including men who have sex with men and people who inject drugs. The efficacy of PrEP is closely dependent on adherence, and it is recommended for individuals with substantial risk for HIV infection. PrEP involves the use of antiretroviral therapy (ART) daily or before and after sex to decrease the risk of acquiring HIV infection. The use of PrEP as a single daily coformulated pill containing tenofovir-emtricitabine is a promising intervention to reduce the likelihood of HIV acquisition in at-risk individuals. However, it is important to note that the efficacy of PrEP may be reduced in case of viruses harboring resistances to tenofovir-emtricitabine, and alternative antiretroviral drugs may be proposed in selected cases."
Does a patch with high-dose capsaicin relieve pain in diabetes mellitus or infection with HIV?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The context suggests that a high-dose capsaicin patch is effective in relieving pain associated with neuropathic conditions, including diabetic neuropathy and HIV-associated neuropathy. The 8% capsaicin patch has been shown to be a safe and effective pain management adjunct for various conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, neuralgias, and diabetic neuropathy. Clinical trials have reported significant efficacy of the 8% capsaicin patch in managing pain associated with HIV-distal sensory polyneuropathy (HIV-DSP) and postherpetic neuralgia. Furthermore, the patch has been shown to improve the quality of life of patients with lumbosacral neuropathic pain. Therefore, based on the available information, a patch with high-dose capsaicin can relieve pain in diabetes mellitus and infection with HIV."
Does following a Mediterranean diet decrease the likelihood of cardiovascular disease in people at high risk?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"The Mediterranean diet has been consistently associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in numerous epidemiological and clinical studies. This dietary pattern is characterized by a high intake of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts, and olive oil, as well as moderate consumption of fish and poultry, and low consumption of red and processed meats, dairy products, and sweets. The Mediterranean diet has been shown to improve multiple cardiovascular risk factors, including blood pressure, lipid profile, and inflammation markers. Furthermore, greater adherence to this diet has been linked to a lower risk of CVD events, such as myocardial infarction, heart failure, and ischemic stroke. Therefore, it is plausible that following a Mediterranean diet could decrease the likelihood of CVD in people at high risk."
Does garlic protect against corona infections?,"['False', 'NEI', 'True']",NEI,NEI,NEI,"The context provided does not contain information regarding the effects of garlic on coronavirus infections. While the context discusses the antibacterial and antiviral properties of garlic, as well as its potential benefits for cardiovascular health, it does not provide any evidence to support the claim that garlic can protect against coronavirus infections. Therefore, based on the information provided, it is not possible to determine whether garlic has any protective effects against coronavirus infections. Further research is needed to establish the potential benefits of garlic in this context."
Do green-lipped mussel preparations improve the symptoms of osteoarthritis?,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",NEI,NEI,NEI,"The available evidence regarding the therapeutic use of green-lipped mussel preparations for osteoarthritis is mixed and inconclusive. While some studies suggest that extracts from the green-lipped mussel (Perna canaliculus) have anti-inflammatory and anti-arthritic effects, and are widely used as a complementary therapy by patients with osteoarthritis, the overall evidence is not consistent and compelling. Reports of clinical studies using freeze-dried mussel powder show mixed outcome measures, with only two of five randomized controlled trials attesting benefits for osteoarthritis patients. Further investigations are necessary to determine whether green-lipped mussel supplements are therapeutic options in the management of arthritis."
"Does regular consumption of chia seeds reduce body weight, blood sugar levels or cholesterol?","['True', 'NEI', 'False']",No,Yes,Yes,"The evidence suggests that regular consumption of chia seeds may contribute to a significant but discrete reduction in body weight and waist circumference, as well as improve lipid profile, particularly in individuals with abnormal initial values. However, the effects on blood sugar levels are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. The reduction in body weight is more pronounced in obese individuals compared to overweight individuals. It is important to note that the evidence regarding the relationship between chia seed consumption and cardiovascular risk factors is currently insufficient, and more research is needed to fully understand the potential benefits of chia seeds."
Are vitamins and minerals effective and safe in lowering cholesterol?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"Numerous studies have demonstrated the potential of various vitamins and nutritional supplements to contribute to a reduction in total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. These supplements have been shown to be beneficial in managing moderate hypercholesterolemia, improving serum lipid profiles, and lowering total cholesterol, triglyceride, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. Notably, soluble fibers and legume proteins have been identified as safe and practical approaches for cholesterol reduction. Furthermore, dietary phytosterols have been reported to lower total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and high doses of phytosterols have been shown to significantly reduce blood cholesterol in randomized controlled trials."
Does sunscreen reduce the likelihood of skin cancer?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The use of sunscreen has been shown to reduce the risk of certain skin cancers, such as squamous cell carcinoma and melanoma. Numerous epidemiological investigations have demonstrated that sunlight is carcinogenic to humans, and the use of sunscreen may be effective in decreasing the risk of skin cancer. A review of results from randomized controlled trials supports the beneficial effects of sunscreen application on the occurrence of skin cancers and skin photoaging. Sunscreen use is widely advocated as a preventive measure against sun-induced skin cancers. Sunscreen is an effective way to protect the skin and reduce skin cancer risk. However, it is important to note that sunscreens are often used in a suboptimal manner, compromising their effectiveness. Additionally, sunscreen use has paradoxically been associated with the increasing incidence of skin cancer, possibly due to the ability of sunscreens to delay or avoid sunburn episodes, which may allow prolonged exposure to unfiltered ultraviolet radiation. Nonetheless, the evidence supports the use of sunscreen as a primary strategy to prevent sunburn and later skin cancer."
Can motherwort reduce migraine attacks?,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",Yes,NEI,NEI,"The context suggests that motherwort has been used as a medicinal herb for many years in both China and Europe, and has been shown to have beneficial effects for women's diseases. However, there is no direct evidence provided in the context that motherwort can reduce migraine attacks. The context mentions a randomized controlled clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of acupuncture compared with naproxen in menstrual-related migraine patients, but does not mention motherwort as a treatment option. Additionally, the context mentions that treatment of motherwort ethanol extract in vivo markedly suppressed the development of uterine adenomyosis and mammary cancers in mice, but this does not necessarily indicate that motherwort can reduce migraine attacks. Therefore, based on the information provided in the context, it is not possible to determine whether motherwort can reduce migraine attacks."
Can methadone enhance the effects of chemotherapy or other cancer treatments and help cure cancer?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"Preclinical in vitro and mouse studies have suggested that methadone, an analgesic drug, can induce cell death and sensitivity to chemo- or radiotherapy in various types of cancer cells, including leukemia, glioblastoma, and carcinoma. Methadone has also been shown to elicit antitumor activity by downregulating the threshold of apoptosis and enhancing the effects of different chemotherapeutic agents. This evidence supports the concept of using methadone as a chemosensitizer in the future treatment of cancer. However, it is important to note that there are currently no relevant clinical studies indicating that the use of methadone can prolong survival in cancer patients. Therefore, while methadone has shown promise as a potential cancer treatment, further research is needed to fully understand its efficacy and safety in this context."
Does an extract from the African black bean (active ingredient 5-hydroxytryptophan) help against lovesickness?,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",NEI,NEI,NEI,"The context provided does not contain information on the use of African black bean extract for the treatment of lovesickness. While it mentions the presence of 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) in the seeds of the African plant Griffonia simplicifolia and its role as a precursor to serotonin, it does not discuss its effects on lovesickness. Additionally, the context focuses on the health benefits, anti-inflammatory properties, and potential as an anti-obesity agent of various African beans and plants. Therefore, it is not possible to make a definitive conclusion on the effectiveness of African black bean extract for lovesickness based on the provided context."
"Can the ""Miracle Mineral Supplement"" MMS (sodium chlorite) cure diseases or alleviate ailments?","['NEI', 'False', 'True']",NEI,No,No,"The context provided discusses the benefits of methylsulfonylmethane (MSM) and magnesium supplements, but does not mention the ""Miracle Mineral Supplement"" (MMS) or sodium chlorite. MMS has been promoted as a cure for various diseases, but there is no scientific evidence to support these claims. In fact, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has warned that MMS can cause serious harm to health, including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and life-threatening low blood pressure. Therefore, it is not recommended to use MMS as a treatment for any disease or ailment."
"In Covid-19, do nicotine or smoking have a protective effect, i.e., do they prevent severe progression or death?","['NEI', 'True', 'False']",NEI,NEI,NEI,"The evidence regarding the protective effects of nicotine or smoking in Covid-19 is inconclusive. While some studies suggest that active smokers are underrepresented among patients with Covid-19, other studies report the opposite trend. The proposed mechanisms by which smoking might be protective include an anti-inflammatory effect of nicotine, a blunted immune response in smokers, and increased nitric oxide in the respiratory tract. However, these mechanisms have not been definitively proven to prevent severe progression or death in Covid-19. Furthermore, it is well established that cigarette smoking is associated with morbidity and mortality in several respiratory infections. Therefore, it is important to continue investigating the interaction between smoking and Covid-19 to accurately assess the risk of contracting Covid-19 among smokers and the progression to mechanical ventilation or death in patients suffering from it."
Can pain from a sprained ankle be relieved by arnica ointment or arnica gel?,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",NEI,NEI,NEI,"The context does not provide information on the efficacy of arnica ointment or arnica gel in relieving pain from a sprained ankle. The study mentioned in the context compares the efficacy of traumeel ointment, traumeel gel, and diclofenac gel in managing pain and improving joint function in acute ankle sprains. The results indicate that traumeel ointment and gel decreased pain and improved joint function to the same extent as diclofenac gel, and were well tolerated. However, the study does not include arnica ointment or gel as a treatment option. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the efficacy of arnica ointment or gel in relieving pain from a sprained ankle based on the information provided in the context."
"Does taking blood pressure medication in the evening prevent more heart attacks, strokes, and other acute cardiovascular diseases?","['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The evidence suggests that evening administration of antihypertensive medication is associated with a significant reduction in non-dipper blood pressure patterns, which are linked to increased cardiovascular risk. This reduction is more pronounced than with standard morning dosing. Furthermore, bedtime dosing of antihypertensive medication has been shown to reduce nocturnal blood pressure and increase the day-night blood pressure fall. While the timing of antihypertensive drug administration does not affect mean 24-hour or clinic blood pressure levels, nighttime blood pressure strongly predicts cardiovascular events. Therefore, it can be inferred that taking blood pressure medication in the evening may prevent more heart attacks, strokes, and other acute cardiovascular diseases. However, more long-term outcome studies are needed to confirm these findings."
Does stimulation current therapy (TENS - Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation) help with worn knee joints (knee osteoarthritis)?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"According to a recent meta-analysis study, there is strong evidence to support the use of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) as an effective treatment for managing osteoarthritis (OA) knee pain. TENS has been proposed as a nonoperative treatment for OA and has been reported to relieve pain due to knee OA. The use of TENS for 3 months has shown encouraging results in improving pain, function, and quality of life in patients with painful osteoarthritic knees. TENS has also been found to significantly reduce pain and morphine requirement over a period of 24 hours and to promote functional recovery in patients who have undergone total knee arthroplasty. However, TENS alone may not produce significant improvement in functional performance among people with knee OA over a short period of time."
Does regular consumption of ground flaxseed harm health?,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",NEI,NEI,NEI,"Justification: The provided context suggests that the effects of flaxseed consumption on health are variable and not fully understood. While some studies indicate that flaxseed may have beneficial effects, such as reducing the risk of chronic non-communicable diseases and playing a role in the prevention of cancer and heart disease, other studies suggest that it may have adverse effects. For instance, prolonged consumption of flaxseed in integral form has been shown to increase the 17β-estradiol hormone, which could potentially have negative implications for health. Additionally, the long-term implications of flaxseed consumption on fertility and the hemopoietic system, serum glucose, and renal and kidney function are not yet fully understood. Therefore, it is not possible to definitively state whether regular consumption of ground flaxseed harms health based on the provided context."
Do pregnant women who take vitamin D have a lower risk of preterm birth?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"The current evidence suggests that vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy may reduce the risk of preterm birth. Several studies have demonstrated an association between maternal serum vitamin D levels and preterm labor. Furthermore, vitamin D supplementation has been shown to decrease the incidence of low birth weight, which is a risk factor for preterm birth. While the exact mechanism by which vitamin D exerts its protective effects is not fully understood, it is hypothesized that vitamin D may reduce the risk of pregnancy complications such as preeclampsia and gestational diabetes mellitus, which are also associated with preterm delivery. However, it is important to note that the benefits of vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy remain an area of ongoing research, and further studies are needed to confirm these findings."
"Do turmeric preparations relieve the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis (""rheumatism"") better than a placebo or painkiller???","['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The in vivo efficacy of well-characterized curcuminoid-containing turmeric extracts in the prevention or treatment of arthritis has been demonstrated using streptococcal cell wall (SCW)-induced arthritis, a well-described animal model of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). An essential oil-depleted turmeric fraction containing 41% of the three major curcuminoids was efficacious in preventing joint inflammation when treatment was started before, but not after, the onset of joint inflammation. The three major curcuminoids are responsible for this antiarthritic effect, while the remaining compounds in the crude turmeric extract may inhibit this protective effect. These findings suggest that the combined treatment of curcumin and essential turmeric oils provides superior protection from dss-induced colitis than curcumin alone, highlighting the anti-inflammatory potential of turmeric."
Is colloidal gold good for health?,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"Colloidal gold, a sol composed of nanoparticles of Au(0), has been studied for its potential application in medicine for centuries. It has been used as a therapeutic for the treatment of cancer and as an indicator for immunodiagnostics. Based on the literature, elemental gold via the oral route is not considered to pose a health concern to humans in general. Gold is a multifunctional material that has been utilized in medicinal applications for its bacteriostatic, anticorrosive, and antioxidative properties. It is also used in (nano-)medicine, usually in the form of nanoparticles, due to the solid proofs given of its therapeutic effects on several diseases. Gold plays an important role in the vaccine field as an adjuvant and a carrier, reducing toxicity, enhancing immunogenic activity, and providing stability in storage. One small recent study demonstrated a possible positive effect of gold on cognitive ability. By manufacturing gold in a nanoscale format, it is possible to passively distribute the material through the body, where it can localize in tumors and be safely excreted through the urinary system. Gold compounds have long been used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Gold is a nonessential element with a variety of applications in medicine. Nanoscale particles of gold now command a great deal of attention for biomedical applications. Elemental gold is used as a food coloring agent and in dental fillings. In addition, gold nanoparticles are gaining increasing attention due to their potential use as inert carriers for medical purposes. However, Au(CN)2- produced locally may facilitate the cellular uptake and hence the therapeutic and toxic effects of gold drugs. Considering the high amount of scientific data on nanogold"
Are vegetables prepared in a microwave oven less healthy than those prepared in other ways?,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",No,NEI,NEI,"The healthiness of vegetables prepared in a microwave oven compared to other methods is not definitively established due to the controversial results in the literature. The microwave cooking process can present varying outcomes depending on the conditions employed, such as time, power, and added water. In general, longer microwave cooking times and higher volumes of cooking water should be avoided to minimize nutrient losses. However, non-uniform heating is a concern in microwave cooking, which may impact the retention of vitamins and phytochemicals. Steaming, including microwave steaming, is generally preferred over boiling for certain vegetables, as it retains nutrients better. Consuming raw vegetables offers essential nutrients that may not be present in cooked vegetables. The impact of cooking methods on food nutrients is significant, and the sources and washing techniques used for vegetables can influence health risks. Therefore, it is not possible to definitively state that vegetables prepared in a microwave oven are less healthy than those prepared in other ways."
Does hydroxychloroquine reduce the likelihood of dying from covid-19 disease?,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",No,No,No,"The use of hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for COVID-19 has been investigated, but studies have not demonstrated a significant benefit in reducing mortality. A pooled analysis of recent studies suggests that hydroxychloroquine does not provide additional benefit in reducing mortality in COVID-19 patients when given as an add-on to standard care. The use of hydroxychloroquine as a post-exposure prophylaxis has also not been shown to prevent illness compatible with COVID-19 or confirmed infection. While hydroxychloroquine has been proposed as a potential treatment for COVID-19 due to its anti-inflammatory and anti-viral action, its efficacy remains uncertain."
Does a legal smoking ban reduce the likelihood of cardiovascular disease in nonsmokers?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",Yes,Yes,Yes,Justification: The implementation of a comprehensive smoking ban in New York State was associated with reduced hospital admissions for acute myocardial infarction and stroke. Participants living in areas with smoke-free policies had lower systolic blood pressure on average compared to those in areas without policies. Smoke-free policies in restaurants and bars were associated with mean within-person reductions in systolic blood pressure. These findings suggest that reductions in secondhand smoke exposure due to smoke-free policies may improve population-level cardiovascular health.
"For women at high risk of breast cancer, does a precautionary mastectomy make more sense than regular participation in intensive screening?","['NEI', 'True', 'False']",NEI,NEI,NEI,"Justification: The context provided suggests that prophylactic mastectomy can significantly reduce the risk of breast cancer in high-risk women, including those with a known BRCA1/2 mutation. However, it also emphasizes that the decision to undergo this procedure should be based on an in-depth assessment of the individual's risk, and a thorough discussion of the benefits against its potential surgical risks and psychological impact. The context does not provide a direct comparison between prophylactic mastectomy and regular intensive screening, and thus, it is not possible to definitively state whether a precautionary mastectomy makes more sense than regular participation in intensive screening. The decision would likely depend on a variety of factors, including the individual's personal preferences, the specifics of their risk profile, and the effectiveness of the available screening methods."
Does filling with hydrogel help with chronic back pain caused by a worn disc?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The evidence suggests that filling with hydrogel can help with chronic back pain caused by a worn disc. Studies have shown that high-density collagen hydrogels can restore mechanical function of injured discs and potentially deliver biological agents to aid in repair. A novel hydrogel has been developed to replace lost nucleus pulposus and restore normal disc biomechanics following herniation and surgery. Percutaneous intervertebral hydrogel implantation is a current treatment procedure that aims to restore hydration of a degenerated disc and is indicated for discogenic low-back pain and mild radicular pain. In a study, hydrogel implantation reduced range of motion (ROM) by 17% compared with discectomy and returned ROM to intact levels. The use of absorbable gel can also reduce scar tissue surrounding the nerve and improve outcomes. These findings suggest that filling with hydrogel can be an effective treatment for chronic back pain caused by a worn disc."
Can oregano oil relieve discomfort or disease?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The context suggests that oregano oil has been used in folk medicine to alleviate various ailments, including inflammation-related diseases, respiratory and digestive disorders, and rheumatism. The antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of oregano oil have been attributed to its polyphenolic content. Studies have shown that oregano oil has antibacterial activity against bacteria associated with food poisoning and can inhibit soybean lipoxygenase, demonstrating its anti-inflammatory efficacy. Furthermore, the health benefits of carvacrol, a compound obtained from oregano oil, have been scientifically proven. Therefore, it can be inferred that oregano oil has the potential to relieve discomfort or disease."
Does valerian help with sleep disorders?,"['True', 'False', 'NEI']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"Valerian (Valeriana officinalis) has been advocated for promoting sleep and is a commonly used herbal remedy for the alleviation of sleep problems. Preclinical studies suggest that valerian has sedative and muscle-relaxant effects. Valerian improves subjective experiences of sleep when taken nightly over one- to two-week periods and appears to be a safe sedative/hypnotic choice in patients with mild to moderate insomnia. Valerian extract and the flavonoids linarin and apigenin have been found to be effective in reducing sleep latency. The herb valerian may be useful as a mild sleep aid in clinical populations, such as persons with rheumatoid arthritis. However, it is important to note that the outcomes of previous clinical studies are inconsistent and more research is needed to fully understand the effects of valerian on sleep disorders."
Do wound care products with sodium hypochlorite such as ActiMaris promote the healing process of wounds?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The context suggests that wound care products containing sodium hypochlorite, such as ActiMaris, may promote the healing process of wounds. Hypochlorite solutions, including sodium hypochlorite, are known to be efficacious when used to topically decontaminate intact skin. Hypochlorous acid, a component of sodium hypochlorite, has both anti-microbial and wound healing properties, with a growing role in pre-procedural care on the face. A study comparing the decontamination efficacy of sodium hypochlorite solutions to untreated controls in wounds exposed to sulfur mustard (HD) further supports the potential of sodium hypochlorite in wound healing. Additionally, the context mentions the development of a novel sodium alginate-based hydrocolloid wound dressing (HCD) with improved wound healing properties, which suggests that sodium-based wound care products may have a positive impact on wound healing."
Can green tea protect against coronavirus infection or help treat covid-19?,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",NEI,NEI,NEI,"The context provided discusses the potential health benefits of green tea, including its antiviral properties against the H1N1 virus and its ability to reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases. However, there is no information regarding its effects on coronavirus infection or COVID-19. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether green tea can protect against coronavirus infection or help treat COVID-19 based on the provided context. Further research is needed to investigate the potential effects of green tea on coronavirus infection and COVID-19."
Does platelet-rich plasma therapy (autologous blood therapy) reduce pain in osteoarthritis of the knee joint?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"The study demonstrates that platelet-rich plasma (PRP) therapy, an autologous blood therapy, has been shown to reduce pain in osteoarthritis of the knee joint. The results indicate that PRP injections have longer-lasting effects within 180 days in the treatment of knee osteoarthritis, as evidenced by the reduction of pain scores, such as the WOMAC score. The therapy, which uses the autologous blood of the patient, has fewer side effects compared to other treatments. Furthermore, PRP has been associated with better outcomes than hyaluronic acid in knee osteoarthritis and has a statistically significant benefit in knee osteoarthritis when compared with hyaluronic acid. The improvements in knee osteoarthritis symptoms with PRP have been attributed to its ability to modify intra-articular inflammatory processes."
"Does EMDR work similarly to exposure therapy, another well-studied form of psychotherapy for the symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder???","['True', 'NEI', 'False']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"Justification: The context suggests that Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) and exposure therapy are both effective treatments for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). EMDR is considered an evidence-based treatment for PTSD and is considered highly efficacious for the treatment of PTSD. The context also mentions that EMDR and trauma-focused cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) tend to be equally efficacious, and a meta-analysis for subscale scores of PTSD symptoms indicated that EMDR was better for decreased intrusion and arousal severity compared to CBT. This suggests that EMDR and exposure therapy, which is a form of CBT, work similarly in treating the symptoms of PTSD."
Can sore muscles be relieved by arnica ointment or arnica gel?,"['NEI', 'True', 'False']",No,No,No,"The use of arnica ointment or gel for relieving sore muscles has been studied in various contexts, including delayed onset muscle soreness and osteoarthritis of the hands. In a study evaluating the clinical efficacy of arnica at a high potency (200c) on moderating delayed onset muscle soreness and accompanying symptoms of muscle dysfunction, the results did not substantiate its clinical efficacy. In fact, pain scores on legs treated with arnica were found to be higher than those receiving placebo 24 hours after exercise. Similarly, in a randomized, double-blind study comparing the effects of ibuprofen and arnica gel preparations in patients with osteoarthritis of the hands, there was no difference in muscle tenderness between arnica and placebo. Furthermore, a study investigating the use of topical arnica ointment after upper blepharoplasty found that it did not improve postoperative outcome, and there was no difference in swelling, ecchymosis, erythema, pain, or patient satisfaction with recovery and outcome between arnica and placebo. Therefore, based on the available evidence, it can be concluded that sore muscles cannot be relieved by arnica ointment or arnica gel."
Can hyposensitization by means of drops or tablets administered under the tongue help with hay fever?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",Yes,No,No,"The context indicates that while hyposensitization therapy is useful in some patients, the present regimens of oral hyposensitization cannot be recommended for hay fever. A double-blind placebo efficacy study failed to prove any beneficial effect of oral hyposensitization measured by symptom score, medication score, nasal provocation test, or skin prick test. Controlled studies proving a beneficial effect of oral hyposensitization are lacking. The total management of hay fever involves a multifaceted approach including environmental control, pharmacotherapy, and immunotherapy. Intranasal microemulsion treatment can attenuate allergen challenge-induced nasal symptoms and plasma exudation in allergic rhinitis. However, the context does not provide evidence to support the claim that hyposensitization by means of drops or tablets administered under the tongue can help with hay fever."
Does tocilizumab specifically help children with rheumatoid arthritis (juvenile idiopathic arthritis) ?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",Yes,Yes,Yes,"Justification: Tocilizumab, a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody and IL-6 receptor antagonist, is currently approved for the treatment of systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (SJIA) and polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (PJIA) in children aged 2 years or older who are refractory to conventional treatment. Studies have investigated the efficacy and safety of tocilizumab in children with these disorders and have found it to be associated with significantly reduced disability and pain, as well as improved health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in SJIA and PJIA patients. Therefore, it can be concluded that tocilizumab specifically helps children with rheumatoid arthritis, specifically juvenile idiopathic arthritis."
Will women who have recurrent bladder infections get rid of them faster if they take cranberry products only after the disease is already there???,"['NEI', 'False', 'True']",NEI,No,No,"The evidence suggests that cranberry products, including juice and tablets, may have a role in preventing recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs) in older females, as well as reducing the relapse rate for acute cystitis in young women. However, the evidence for the effectiveness of cranberry products in treating existing UTIs is limited. A double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of the effects of cranberry on risk of recurring UTI among 319 college women presenting with an acute UTI found that cranberry juice did not significantly reduce UTI risk compared with placebo. Additionally, a study of otherwise healthy college women with an acute UTI found that those drinking 8 oz of 27% cranberry juice twice daily did not experience a decrease in the 6-month incidence of a second UTI, compared with those drinking a placebo. Therefore, it is unlikely that women who have recurrent bladder infections will get rid of them faster if they take cranberry products only after the disease is already present."
Does PEMF noticeably improve pain in osteoarthritis? Does the method improve mobility and quality of life in sufferers?,"['True', 'NEI', 'False']",NEI,Yes,Yes,"The study suggests that Pulsed Electromagnetic Field (PEMF) therapy has clinically significant effects on pain in patients with osteoarthritis (OA). Compared to a placebo, PEMF therapy demonstrated a beneficial effect on pain, stiffness, and physical function in patients with OA. This indicates that PEMF therapy may improve mobility and quality of life in OA sufferers. However, it is important to note that the effectiveness of PEMF therapy is still controversial and further research is needed to establish its long-term efficacy."
