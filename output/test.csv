Is there any relationship between histone ubiquitylation and splicing?,Yes,"Recent studies have revealed that histone ubiquitylation, particularly of histones H2A and H2B, plays a significant role in the regulation of splicing. Ubiquitin, a key regulator of cellular processes, has been found to have a direct role in the dynamics of splicing complexes. The results suggest a previously unknown ubiquitin-dependent mechanism for controlling the pre-mRNA splicing pathway. Furthermore, H2B ubiquitylation has been shown to stimulate the recruitment of early splicing factors, such as U1 and U2 snRNPs, onto nascent RNAs. The study also proposes that splicing regulators may actively modulate chromatin structure when recruited to their target RNA sequences cotranscriptionally. These findings suggest a strong regulatory link between histone ubiquitylation and splicing.","recent studies have provided strong evidence for a regulatory link among chromatin structure, histone modification, and splicing regulation.  ubiquitin regulates many cellular processes, but its potential roles during splicing are unknown.  here we show that splicing regulator hu proteins can induce local histone hyperacetylation by association with their target sequences on the pre-mrna surrounding alternative exons of two different genes.  we have developed a new strategy that reveals a direct role for ubiquitin in the dynamics of splicing complexes.  these results suggest that histone modifications impact splicing of distinct subsets of genes using distinct pathways.  these results reveal a previously unknown ubiquitin-dependent mechanism for controlling the pre-mrna splicing pathway.  we investigated whether a causal relationship exists between splicing and chromatin modification by asking whether splice-site mutations affect the methylation of histone h3k36.  furthermore, semi-quantitative mass spectrometry on purified nuclear mrnps and chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis on intron-containing genes indicated that h2b ubiquitylation, but not set1-, set2- or dot1-dependent h3 methylation, stimulates recruitment of the early splicing factors, namely u1 and u2 snrnps, onto nascent rnas.  ubiquitination of histones provides an important mechanism regulating chromatin remodeling and gene expression.  a ubiquitin mutant (i44a) that can enter the conjugation pathway but is compromised in downstream functions diminishes splicing activity by reducing the levels of the u4/u6-u5 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snrnp).  histone ubiquitylation has been speculated to directly influence the structure and dynamics of nucleosomes.  with the aid of the recently developed ubiquitinated histone-specific antibodies, an intriguing link between histone ubiquitination and cancer development has been established.  these results suggest that the cotranscriptional splicing apparatus influences establishment of normal patterns of histone modification.  commitment to splicing occurs co-transcriptionally, but a major unanswered question is the extent to which various modifications of chromatin, the template for transcription in vivo, contribute to the regulation of splicing.  post-translational modifications (e.g., ubiquitylation) of histones play important roles in dynamic regulation of chromatin.  we propose that splicing regulators may actively modulate chromatin structure when recruited to their target rna sequences cotranscriptionally.  our analysis in three cell lines shows that, while both genomic and chromatin features can predict splicing to varying degrees, genomic features are the primary drivers of splicing, and the predictive power of chromatin features can largely be explained by their correlation with genomic features; chromatin features do not yield substantial independent contribution to splicing predictability.  histone ubiquitination predominately targets histones h2a and h2b.  we here show that ubr2 localizes to meiotic chromatin regions, including unsynapsed axial elements linked to chromatin inactivation, and mediates transcriptional silencing via the ubiquitination of histone h2a.  recent studies have revealed ubiquitin ligases involved in histone ubiquitination, yet the responsible enzymes and the function of histone ubiquitination in spermatogenesis remain unclear. ||| ",Yes

Does oncogene-induced DNA replication stress inhibit genomic instability?,No,"Oncogene-induced DNA replication stress does not inhibit genomic instability. Instead, it is a significant contributor to genomic instability in cancer. Activated oncogenes, such as cyclin e1 and cdc25a, induce replication stress by driving cell proliferation with insufficient nucleotide levels. This replication stress leads to the formation of single-stranded DNA gaps, which reduce cell fitness and promote genome instability. The precise nature of oncogene-induced replicative stress remains poorly understood, but it is clear that it plays a crucial role in the early stages of cancer development. The replication stress response, which is activated by DNA damage and replication obstacles, as well as oncogenes, serves as an anticancer barrier. However, the mechanisms by which neoplastic cells tolerate oncogene-induced DNA replication stress are not well understood. Exogenously supplied nucleosides can rescue replication stress and DNA damage, and decrease oncogene-induced transformation, but the extent of replication stress affects the probability of neoplastic transformation.","here, we review our current understanding of replication initiation and its regulation, describe mechanisms by which activated oncogenes might interfere with these processes and discuss how replicative stress might contribute to the genomic instability seen in cancers.  oncogene-induced replication stress, for instance as a result of cyclin e1 overexpression, causes genomic instability and has been linked to tumorigenesis.  oncogene-induced dna replication stress activates the dna damage response (ddr), a crucial anticancer barrier.  dna replication stress promotes genome instability in cancer.  here, we identify that oncogene expression, similar to other replication stress-inducing agents, induces single-stranded dna (ssdna) gaps that reduce cell fitness.  activated oncogenes promote replicative stress, inducing a dna damage response (ddr) early in tumorigenesis.  one mechanism by which oncogene expression induces replication stress is to drive cell proliferation with insufficient nucleotide levels.  the mechanisms by which neoplastic cells tolerate oncogene-induced dna replication stress are poorly understood.  we modeled oncogene-induced replication stress using inducible expression of cyclin e1 or cdc25a in non-transformed rpe-1 cells, either in a tp53 wild-type or tp53-mutant background.  chromosomal instability in early cancer stages is caused by replication stress.  chromosomal instability in early cancer stages is caused by stress on dna replication.  despite its potential importance in early cancer development, the precise nature of oncogene-induced replicative stress remains poorly understood.  we propose that nucleolytic processing of unusual replication intermediates mediates oncogene-induced genotoxicity and that limiting such processing to mitosis is a central anti-tumorigenic function of the dna damage checkpoints.  the replication stress response, which serves as an anticancer barrier, is activated not only by dna damage and replication obstacles but also oncogenes, thus obscuring how cancer evolves.  exogenously supplied nucleosides rescued the replication stress and dna damage and dramatically decreased oncogene-induced transformation.  here, we investigated whether replication stress can be modulated by both genetic and non-genetic factors and whether the extent of replication stress affects the probability of neoplastic transformation.  oncogene-induced dna damage elicits genomic instability in epithelial cancer cells, but apoptosis is blocked through inactivation of the tumor suppressor p53.  folate deficiency significantly enhances oncogene-induced replication stress, leading to increased dna damage and tumorigenicity in vitro.  single cell sequencing revealed that replication stress and mitotic defects upon cyclin e1 or cdc25a overexpression resulted in genomic instability.  replication stress, a major cause of genome instability in cycling cells, is mainly prevented by the atr-dependent replication stress response pathway in somatic cells. ||| ",No
Is there an association between bruxism and reflux,Yes,"Recent studies have identified strong associations among bruxism, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and tooth wear. GERD has been identified as a risk factor for bruxism after adjustment for other variables. Rhythmic masticatory muscle activity, including sleep bruxism (SB), can be induced in healthy individuals by experimental esophageal acidification, which plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of GERD. Furthermore, sleep bruxism is prevalent in GERD patients, and GERD is highly associated with SB. These findings suggest that there is a significant association between bruxism and reflux.","recent advances have clarified the relationship between gastroesophageal reflux and sleep bruxism (sb).  the pathophysiological processes of tooth wear may be complicated by the relationship between bruxism and gastroesophageal reflux disease (gerd).  bruxism with reflux symptoms for extensive time-periods was associated with severe tooth wear for the whole dentition (odds ratio, 4.70, 95% confidence interval, 2.04⁻10.83).  there seems to be an association between bruxism, respiratory problems, and dental caries in children.  the aim of the present study was to determine whether there is an association between respiratory problems and dental caries in children who exhibit the habit of bruxism.  a statistically significant association was found between respiratory problems and dental caries among the children with bruxism.  in conclusion, strong associations were identified among bruxism, gerd, and tooth wear.  after adjustment, gerd was identified as a risk factor of bruxism.  background reflux disease is a common gastrointestinal problem.  rhythmic masticatory muscle activity, including sleep bruxism (sb), can be induced in healthy individuals by experimental esophageal acidification, which plays an important role in the pathogenesis of gastroesophageal reflux disease (gerd).  successful treatment of sleep-related respiratory effort may lead to improved or resolution of bruxism in cases where such a causal relationship does exist.  support to the existence of an association between bruxism and psychosocial disorders has been provided.  sleep bruxism is prevalent in gerd patients, and gerd is highly associated with sb.  the objective of this study was to evaluate the associations among bruxism, gerd, and tooth wear.  the association between reflux disease and gastritis pattern is controversial.  current proposed causes of bruxism appear to be a combination of genetic and environmental (g×e) factors, with epigenetics providing a robust framework for investigating g×e interactions, and their involvement in bruxism makes it a suitable candidate for epigenetic research.  the aim of this case-control study was to assess the existence of an association between bruxism and psychosocial disorders in adolescents., participants were chosen among 114, 12-14 year old students (girls).  bruxism is often indicated as a risk factor for the occurrence of temporomandibular disorders (tmd).  bruxism is highly prevalent and defined as abnormal habitual mouth activity including clenching of the teeth and increased jaw muscle activity.  gastro-esophageal reflux is considered a major culprit in the pathogenesis of barrett's esophagus (be). ||| ",Yes
Does triiodothyronine (T3) has cardiac angiogenic effects?,Yes,"The provided context does not explicitly discuss the angiogenic effects of triiodothyronine (T3) on the cardiac system. The information presented primarily focuses on the direct cardiac effects of T3, including its role in increasing cardiac contractility, improving left ventricular performance, and regulating cardiac contractility. The mechanisms by which T3 exerts these effects are also discussed, such as the induction of endothelial nitric oxide synthase via PI3K/Akt non-genomic signaling and the reduction of calcium response in vascular smooth muscle cells. However, the specific question of whether T3 has cardiac angiogenic effects is not addressed. Further studies are needed to determine the potential angiogenic effects of T3 on the cardiac system.","the direct cardiac effect occurs through triiodothyronine (t3)-mediated synthesis of specific proteins.  recent studies have suggested that acute administration of 3, 5, 3' triiodo-l-thyronine (t3) may increase ventricular performance; however, the direct cellular effects of acute t3 administration are not understood.  3,3',5-triiodo-l-thyronine (t3), a biologically active form of thyroid hormone, increases cardiac contractility.  3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (t(3)), the active form of th, induces the activation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase via pi3k/akt non-genomic signaling.  administration of 3,5,3'-triiodo-l-thyronine (t3) has recently been suggested to acutely improve left ventricular performance.  thus, we investigated the effects of triiodothyronine (t3) on reperfusion injury in a langendorff-perfused rat heart model of 30 min zero-flow ischaemia and 60 min of (r) with or without t3 (40 microg/l) at r, t3-r60, n = 11 and cnt-r60, n = 10, respectively.  t3 causes arterial relaxation and reduction of systemic vascular resistance, resulting in an increase in cardiac output.  t3 gave rise to a dose-dependent increase in cardiac performance within a certain dose range.  more recent studies have suggested that t3 may increase cardiac performance acutely, independent of protein neosynthesis.  3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (t3) is essential for the growth and the regulation of metabolic functions, moreover, the growth-stimulatory effect of t3 has largely been demonstrated and the pathways via which t3 promotes cell growth have been recently investigated.  the aim of this study was to determine whether 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (t3) can promote the proliferation of epicardial progenitor cells (epcs) and to investigate the potential underlying mechanism.  triiodothyronine regulates cardiac contractility; however, the mechanisms by which it produces its acute contractile effects remains unknown.  we evaluated its effect vs triiodothyronine (t3), on glucose-induced insulin secretion in ins-1e cells, a rat insulinoma line, and on human islets.  while triiodothyronine (t3) is usually considered to be the active form of thyroid hormone, one form of diiodothyronine (3,5-t2) exerts t3-like effects on energy consumption and lipid metabolism.  t3 reduced calcium response of vascular smooth muscle cells to ang ii by 26%.  we compared the acute effects of thyroid hormones (triiodothyronine  and thyroxine ) and of isoproterenol on the contractility of isolated rat hearts.  thus, acute t3 administration may provide a novel modality to improve left ventricular contractile function independent of the beta-adrenergic receptor system.  3,3',5-triiodo-l-thyronine (t3) improves hepatic lipid accumulation by increasing lipid catabolism but it also increases lipogenesis, which at first glance appears contradictory.  further studies are needed to identify the mechanisms underlying the acute contractile effects of t3 and to determine whether t3 will prove useful for increasing ventricular function in patients.  thus, t3 acutely stimulates cardiac contraction by mechanisms that differ from those of the more commonly used beta-adrenergic receptor agonists and phosphodiesterase inhibitors. ||| ",Yes
Does surgery for ovarian endometriomas improve fertility?,No,"The available data in the literature suggest that surgical management of endometriomas has no significant effect on IVF pregnancy rates and ovarian response to stimulation compared with no treatment. Pre-cycle removal of endometrioma may have an adverse impact on ovarian reserve, and pregnancy outcomes seem to be similar with or without surgery in patients undergoing IVF treatment. The laparoscopic excision of ovarian endometriomas appears to increase the chances of spontaneous conception, but the value of this treatment in women selected for IVF-ICSI cycles is debated. The literature data suggest that ovarian endometriomas might affect the response to ovarian stimulation and oocyte retrieval. However, it was recently questioned whether the excision of the endometrioma could decrease the function of the operated ovary and if it could affect the subsequent fertility.","in conclusion, ovarian surgery for the treatment of endometriosis reduces the ovarian outcome in ivf/icsi cycles in women >35 years old, and might also decrease pregnancy rates.  does surgical treatment of endometriomas impact on the ovarian reserve as evaluated with antral follicle count (afc)?  controversy exists regarding surgical management of endometriomas in infertile women before in vitro fertilization (ivf) because growing evidence indicates that surgery may impair the ovarian response.  the laparoscopic excision of ovarian endometriomas appears to increase the chances of spontaneous conception, but the value of this treatment in women selected for ivf-icsi cycles is debated.  to evaluate whether laparoscopic excision of endometrioma exerts a qualitative effect on ovarian function.  to investigate the effect of surgical treatment of endometrioma on pregnancy rate and ovarian response to gonadotrophin stimulation in women undergoing ivf.  findings suggest that surgical management of endometriomas before ivf therapy yields similar live birth rates as expectant management.  therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of previous ovarian surgery for endometriosis on the ovarian response in assisted reproduction treatment cycles and its pregnancy outcome.  literature data suggest that ovarian endometriomas might affect the response to ovarian stimulation and oocyte retrieval.  to test the hypothesis that ovarian surgery for endometrioma compromises ovarian function and accelerates ovarian failure.  does the presence of ovarian endometriomas affect ovarian response to ovarian stimulation after adjusting for age and ovarian reserve markers?  collectively the available data in the literature show that surgical management of endometriomas has no significant effect on ivf pregnancy rates and ovarian response to stimulation compared with no treatment.  we aimed to assess the effect of the pre-cycle surgical removal of endometriomas on ivf outcomes in a large number of cycles in patients undergoing ivf/icsi treatment.  this review addresses: the impact of the endometrioma per se and of its surgical treatment on ovarian physiology, on the ovarian reserve, on spontaneous conception and pregnancy outcomes, and on ivf/icsi outcomes.  first-line surgery for ovarian endometriotic cysts appears associated with a better reproductive performance, that is, a mean postoperative pregnancy rate of ∼50%.  to investigate the effects of ovarian endometrioma on the number of oocytes retrieved for in vitro fertilization (ivf).  however, endometrioma surgery may be considered in the subsequent ivf cycles of patients with lower than expected ovarian response.  the objective of the present systematic review and meta-analysis was to compare surgical and expectant management of endometriomas regarding ivf outcomes.  however, it was recently questioned whether the excision of the endometrioma could decrease the function of the operated ovary and if it could affect the subsequent fertility.  pre-cyle removal of endometrioma may have an adverse impact on ovarian reserve, and pregnancy outcomes seem to be similar with or without surgery in patients undergoing ivf treatment. ||| ",Yes
Was tamoxifen tested for treatment of glioma patients?,Yes,"Tamoxifen has been tested for the treatment of glioma patients, as indicated by recent studies. The chemotherapeutic action of tamoxifen on human glioma cell lines has been determined, and high-dose tamoxifen has been shown to have cytotoxic activity against glioma cells. Tamoxifen has also been reported to inhibit the proliferation of some estrogen receptor-negative cell lines, including malignant glioma in vitro. Furthermore, tamoxifen has been investigated for its effects on cell growth and radiosensitivity in C6 glioma cells using a colony-forming assay and a tetrazolium-formazan growth rate assay. These findings suggest that tamoxifen might have a chemotherapeutic effect on temozolomide-resistant glioma through its direct action on mitochondrial complex I inhibition and could provide further evidence to support future clinical trials of tamoxifen for the treatment of glioblastoma.","recent studies have indicated that tamoxifen might have a potential chemotherapeutic effect on glioma.  in the present study, we determined the chemotherapeutic action of tamoxifen on human glioma cell lines.  it has previously been shown that high-dose tamoxifen has cytotoxic activity against glioma cells, but whether this effect is drug specific or represents a general property of serms is unknown.  high-dose tamoxifen was recently reported as a novel treatment for patients with malignant gliomas who have failed standard therapies.  the antiestrogen drug tamoxifen, which is used extensively in the treatment of breast cancer, has also been reported to inhibit the proliferation of some estrogen receptor-negative cell lines, including malignant glioma in vitro.  to explore the possible role of tamoxifen in the treatment of malignant glioma, we have investigated its effects on cell growth and radiosensitivity in c6 glioma cells using a colony-forming assay and a tetrazolium-formazan growth rate assay.  only a minority of patients with malignant gliomas respond to continuous high-dose tamoxifen (tam) treatment.  in summary, our study suggests that tamoxifen might have a chemotherapeutic effect on temozolomide-resistant glioma through its direct action on mitochondrial complex i inhibition and could provide further evidence to support future clinical trials of tamoxifen for the treatment of glioblastoma.  in this study, we demonstrate that tamoxifen and cc-8490, a novel benzopyranone with serm activity, induce glioma cell apoptosis in a dose- and time-dependent manner.  moreover, administration of tamoxifen and cc-8490 suppresses tumor growth in vivo and extends animal survival in glioma xenograft models.  these findings demonstrate for the first time that a serm other than tamoxifen can induce glioma cell apoptosis in vitro and in vivo and that the clinical efficacy of serms for the treatment of malignant gliomas could potentially be enhanced by simultaneous inhibition of the nf-kappab pathway.  tamoxifen inhibits protein kinase c (pkc) in vitro and thus may regulate glioma cell growth by modulating intracellular signal transduction.  taken together, our results demonstrate a synergistic effect of tamoxifen with radiation on intracellular damage in c6 glioma cells, which may in part be due to the inhibition of protein kinase c, suggesting that tamoxifen serves as a useful agent in combination therapy of glioma.  tamoxifen is the leading therapeutic agent in the management of breast cancer.  tamoxifen is one of the most commonly used endocrine therapeutic agents for breast cancer.  tamoxifen, a member of the selective estrogen receptor modulator (serm) family, is widely used in the treatment of estrogen receptor (er)-expressing breast cancer.  tamoxifen, a selective estrogen receptor modulator, is widely used in the chemotherapy of estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer.  tgf-beta2 plasma levels of glioblastoma patients treated with 200 mg tam/day on a continuous basis and of control patients not treated with tam were measured by using an elisa.  in contrast to breast cancer patients, the clinical response to tam in glioblastoma patients is not reflected by changes of tgf-beta2 plasma levels.  recent studies suggest that tamoxifen may be effective not only for er‑positive but also for er‑negative cancer cases. ||| ",Yes
Has proteomics been used in the study of Pick's disease?,No,"The provided context does not explicitly mention the use of proteomics in the study of Pick's disease. The focus of the text is on the immunohistochemical analysis of apoe, the regional and laminar distribution of pick bodies, the pathological profile of Pick's disease, and the coexistence of Pick's disease and Alzheimer's disease in certain cases. The use of proteomics, which involves the large-scale study of proteins, is not discussed.","what is to be understood by the term pick's disease?  to examine a possible role of apoe in pick's disease, an immunohistochemical analysis was performed utilizing a novel site-directed antibody that is specific for an amino-terminal fragment of apoe.  based on these preliminary results, we suggest that some cases of pick disease may be complicated by or involve in inflammatory process.  to evaluate the possibility of inflammatory processes occurring in pick disease pathophysiology.  after a short summary of arnold pick's biography, the history of how pick's disease (pid) was reported is presented, from its clinical symptoms to its molecular characterization.  in the present study, we analyzed the regional and laminar distribution of pick bodies in a series of 16 pick's disease cases.  frontotemporal lobe atrophy is a hallmark of pick's disease (pid), however, the underlying pathobiology of the neuronal losses is unknown.  pick disease is a progressive form of dementia characterized by personality changes, speech disturbances, inattentiveness, and occasionally extrapyramidal phenomena.  pick disease should be considered in the differential diagnosis of dementia in young adults.  the fine structure of a cortical frontal biopsy of pick's disease is described.  pick's disease (pid) is a unique subtype of frontotemporal lobar degeneration characterized pathologically by aggregates of 3-repeat tau.  we report on a patient presenting pick's disease similar to the one reported by pick in 1892, with ubiquitin-positive and tau-negative inclusions.  although several variants have been recognized, the pathological profile of pick disease includes focal frontotemporal atrophy, neuronal loss, astrocytosis, pick bodies, and pick cells.  these results suggest that the presence of neurofibrillary tangles in pick's disease may be more frequent than previously reported, and that pick's disease and alzheimer's disease may coexist in certain cases.  in addition, a few pick's disease cases also had cortical senile plaques.  this study was a retrospective analysis of patients with pick's disease evaluated at mayo clinic, rochester or jacksonville (1995-2018), and identified through an existing database.  pick's disease, a form of progressive senile dementia, is distinguished by the presence of neuronal inclusions known as pick's bodies.  the presence of truncated apoe within pick bodies suggests a broader role of apoe beyond ad and raises the question as to whether this protein contributes to pathogenesis associated with pick's disease.  pick's disease is characterized morphologically by severe atrophy of the frontal and temporal lobes and the presence in the cerebral cortex of degenerative neuronal lesions referred to as pick bodies.  many reports have described loss of neurons in the substantia nigra in pick's disease (pid). ||| ",Yes
Does prolactinoma increase osteoporosis risk?,Yes,"The evidence suggests that individuals with prolactinoma are at an increased risk for osteoporosis. Hyperprolactinemia, or elevated prolactin levels, caused by prolactinoma has been linked with osteoporosis and osteopenia. The duration of the disease and hypogonadism are significant risk factors for bone loss in prolactinoma. Prolactin receptors in osteoblasts suggest a possible direct effect of prolactin on bone. The presence of decreased bone mineral content in hyperprolactinemic patients also supports this hypothesis. Antipsychotic agents that increase circulating serum prolactin levels can potentially lead to osteoporosis and increased risk of bone fracture. The increased prevalence of radiological vertebral fractures in men with prolactin-secreting adenoma further supports the association between prolactinoma and osteoporosis risk.","humans with prolactinoma are at risk for osteoporosis.  raised prolactin levels have been linked with osteoporosis.  there is evidence that prolactin (prl) excess plays a role in the etiology of osteoporosis associated with human prolactinoma.  patients with prolactinoma seem to be at high risk for osteopenia.  osteopenia and osteoporosis because of hyperprolactinaemia caused by prolactinoma may be followed by an increased risk of fracture.  in the premenopausal women, patients with prolactinoma or craniopharyngioma are often accompanied with osteopenia or osteoporosis, and disease duration and hypogonadism are the risk factors of bone loss in prolactinoma.  univariate and multivariate regression analysis indicated that the bone loss in prolactinomas was significantly correlated to disease duration and hypogonadism.  prolactin elevation has been proposed as a risk factor for low bone density and potentially osteoporosis in patients on long-term treatment with prolactin-elevating antipsychotics.  hyperprolactinaemia caused by prolactinoma in women influences bone metabolism unfavourably, more by the impact on the activity of bone turnover markers than on bmd.  levels of prolactin, markers of bone metabolism, and risk factors for osteoporosis were measured.  hyperprolactinaemia may be associated with hidden longer-term consequences, such as osteoporosis, bone fractures, pituitary tumours and breast cancer.  an increased prevalence of radiological vertebral fractures was recently observed in women with prolactin (prl)-secreting adenoma, whereas it is unknown whether this observation may reflect a more general increased risk of fractures in this disease and whether the prevalence of fractures in males is affected by gonadal status.  this may have important implications for prolactin monitoring or the periodic assessment of osteoporosis-related outcomes in patients requiring extended treatment.  although its osteopenic effect has long been explained as hyperprolactinemia-induced hypogonadism, identified prolactin (prl) receptors in osteoblasts suggested a possible direct action of prl on bone.  prolactin (prl) has been reported to be associated with increased bone turnover, and increased bone turnover is also a feature of skeletal fluorosis (sf).  therefore, the present data indicate that the osteoporosis of hyperprolactinemia is likely due to prl-induced hypogonadism, rather than a direct effect of prl on calcium homeostatis.  antipsychotic agents can increase circulating serum prolactin levels, potentially leading to osteoporosis and increased risk of bone fracture.  the presence of decreased bone mineral content in hyperprolactinemic patients suggests that prl may have a direct effect on bone and may be another indication for early treatment of prl-secreting pituitary tumors.  however, the presence of prolactin receptor in human osteosarcoma cell line and primary bone cell culture from mouse calvariae supported the hypothesis of a direct prolactin (prl) action on bone cells.  hyperprolactinemia is associated with high prevalence of radiological vertebral fractures in men with prl-secreting adenoma. ||| ",Yes
Does BNP increase after intensive exercise in athletes?,Yes,"The context indicates that BNP levels increase after intensive exercise in athletes. This is supported by multiple studies that have demonstrated a rise in BNP levels following prolonged and/or strenuous exercise. The increase in BNP concentrations immediately after exercise has been found to be statistically significant compared to baseline values. Additionally, healthy athletes have been shown to have increased BNP concentrations following exercise. The context also suggests that the increase in BNP levels may be due to factors such as right ventricular volume and pressure overload, which are potentially affected by exercise.","the aim of this study was to determine the effect of maximal physical activity on plasma bnp concentrations in healthy individuals within 3 hours after the short-term exercise.  based on the studies in normal subjects indicating that pro-bnp levels changes after exercise, we hypothesized that the pro-bnp might rise after the 6mwt in pah patients, potentially impacting clinical decisions.  bnp was elevated in marathoners, immediately after the race and also after 4 h. we studied the behavior of bnp in the triathlon, which is a complex sport characterized by 3 different activities (swimming, cycling, running).  the increase of bnp concentrations immediately after exercise was statistically significant (p=0.0017) compared to baseline values.  many studies have demonstrated a rise in troponin and brain natriuretic peptide (bnp) levels following prolonged and/or strenuous exercise.  exercise increased plasma anp and bnp in the two groups.  plasma nt-pro-bnp levels were measured at rest and immediately after exercise.  there appears to be a trend of pro-bnp level increasing immediately after exercise and continuing to be elevated at 1 h. pro-bnp levels then return to baseline at 2 h post 6mwt.  in 22 patients (22%) an increase in bnp ≥35pg/ml after the exercise test was observed.  we compared exercise-induced increases in bnp between healthy controls (con) and individuals with cvrf or cvd.  exercise is associated with changes in circulating b-type natriuretic peptide (bnp) and n-terminal-probnp (nt-probnp).  we sought to assess determinants of absolute (δ) and relative (δ%) exercise-induced changes in bnp and nt-probnp.  bnp (n = 418) and nt-probnp (n = 478) at rest and peak exercise were measured in patients undergoing symptom-limited cycle ergometer tests.  thus exercise increases plasma levels of bnp, and impaired left ventricular function may be a main factor in the greater increment in bnp during exercise in patients with congestive heart failure.  healthy athletes demonstrated increased b-type natriuretic peptide (bnp) concentrations following exercise, but it is unknown whether these responses are exaggerated in individuals with cardiovascular risk factors (cvrf) or disease (cvd).  plasma pro-bnp (brain natriuretic peptide) levels are often elevated in response to right ventricular (rv) volume and pressure overload, parameters potentially affected by exercise.  the aim of the study is to determine the factors that cause the release of bnp during the exercise test.  in conclusion, short-term maximal physical exercise in healthy individuals led to a fast and transient rise of plasma bnp concentrations, which remained well within normal range and far below the cut-off value for heart failure (100 pg/ml).  serum bnp concentrations were measured in 191 participants (60±12yrs) of the nijmegen marches before (baseline) and immediately after 4 consecutive days of walking exercise (30-50km/day).  to investigate if the exercise-induced immune response contributes to the exercise-induced increase in brain natriuretic peptide (bnp) in healthy athletes. ||| ",Yes
Are Ultra-conserved elements (UCEs) enriched in segmental duplications?,No,"Ultraconserved elements (UCEs) are not enriched in segmental duplications. In fact, they have been reported to be strongly depleted among segmental duplications. This depletion suggests that UCEs may have a distinct role in genome organization and function, which is not associated with segmental duplications. The observed depletion of UCEs in segmental duplications also highlights the importance of maintaining the integrity of these highly conserved genomic elements.","we have demonstrated that nonexonic uces are depleted among segmental duplications (sds) and copy number variants (cnvs) and proposed that their ultraconservation may reflect a mechanism of copy counting via comparison.  ultraconserved elements (uces) are stretches of hundreds of nucleotides with highly conserved cores flanked by variable regions.  ultraconserved elements (uces) are stretches of hundreds of nucleotides with highly conserved cores flanked by variable regions.  ultraconserved elements (uces) are sequences that are identical between reference genomes of distantly related species.  ultraconserved elements (uces) are discrete genomic elements conserved across large evolutionary distances.  ultraconserved elements (uces), stretches of dna that are identical between distantly related species, are enigmatic genomic features whose function is not well understood.  ultraconserved elements (uces) have become popular markers in phylogenomic studies because of their cost effectiveness and their potential to resolve problematic phylogenetic relationships.  the ultraconserved elements (uces) are defined as stretches of at least 200 base pairs of human dna that match identically with corresponding regions in the mouse and rat genomes, albeit their real significance remains an intriguing issue.  this study explores the relationship between three-dimensional genome organization and ultraconserved elements (uces), an enigmatic set of dna elements that are perfectly conserved between the reference genomes of distantly related species.  ultraconserved elements (uces) show the peculiar feature to retain extended perfect sequence identity among human, mouse, and rat genomes.  ultraconserved elements (uces) are segments of >200 bp length showing absolute sequence identity between orthologous regions of human, rat and mouse genomes.  interestingly, human uces have been reported to be strongly depleted among segmental duplications and benign copy number variants (cnvs).  genome sequence comparison between evolutionarily distant species revealed ultraconserved elements (uces) among mammals under strong purifying selection.  interestingly, we observed that ultraconserved elements clustered by sequence similarity.  ules are located in intergenic or intronic regions and are depleted from segmental duplications.  our findings indicate that these ultraconserved elements are not the exclusive property of higher modern eukaryotes, but rather transmitted from their metazoan ancestors.  ultraconserved elements are highly enriched with binding sites to developmental transcription factors regardless of how they cluster.  interestingly, these elements exhibit properties similar to mammalian uces, such that we named them uce-like elements (ules).  we identified large numbers of ultraconserved elements across distant species.  most intergenic ultraconserved elements (uce) appear to be tissue-specific enhancers, whereas another class of intragenic uces is involved in regulation of gene expression by means of alternative splicing. ||| ",No

Is selenium deficiency involved in autoimmune thyroid disease?,Yes,"Selenium deficiency has been implicated in the pathogenesis of autoimmune thyroid diseases, including Hashimoto's thyroiditis and autoimmune thyroiditis. Selenium, as an antioxidant, plays a crucial role in thyroid physiology and function. Its deficiency has been associated with increased risk of thyroid disease, and a decreased activity of selenium-dependent glutathione peroxidase enzyme within thyroid cells has been reported in areas with severe selenium deficiency. Several studies have demonstrated the suppressive effect of selenium treatment on serum thyroid-specific antibody titers in patients with autoimmune thyroiditis. Although the mechanism underlying this process is not clear, selenium supplementation has been shown to decrease thyroid peroxidase antibody concentrations in patients with autoimmune thyroiditis. Furthermore, a weak negative correlation between selenium levels and antithyroid antibodies has been observed, suggesting that selenium supplementation may improve the course of thyroid autoimmunity.","selenium deficiency, along with genetic predisposition and environmental factors, may have a role in thyroid autoimmunity.  selenium, as an antioxidant, has been implicated in the development of autoimmune thyroiditis (ait).  to study the effect of selenium supplementation in patients with autoimmune thyroid disease.  selenium status appears to have an impact on the development of thyroid pathologies.  the association between selenium and inflammation and the relevance of selenoproteins in follicular thyroid cell physiology have pointed to a putative role of selenoproteins in the pathogenesis of autoimmune thyroid diseases.  selenium (se) deficiency has been implicated in the pathogenesis of hashimoto's thyroiditis (ht), although the available evidence is limited.  the aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of selenium on the incidence and severity of ait, titers of thyroid autoantibodies, and selenoprotein expression in thyroid in a spontaneous autoimmune thyroiditis (sat) model.  selenium substitution has a significant impact on inflammatory activity in thyroid-specific autoimmune disease.  although our data present slightly higher selenium levels in normal persons than in patients with ait, this weak and statistically insignificant trend is not sufficient to support the conclusion of a link between inadequate selenium supply and autoimmune thyroid disease.  recent clinical studies have demonstrated the suppressive effect of selenium (se) treatment on serum thyroid-specific antibody titers in patients with autoimmune thyroiditis (ait), but the mechanism underlying this process is not clear.  se deficiency is associated with increased risk of thyroid disease.  this study is the first to uncover that coexisting se-deficiency and elevated iodine in ht may enhance autoimmune reactions and accelerate the deterioration of thyroid function through oxidative stress.  the aim of the study was to evaluate the role of selenium (se) in childhood autoimmune thyroiditis regarding its effect on thyroid-stimulating hormone (tsh), free thyroxine (ft4), thyroid peroxidase antibodies (tpoab), thyroglobulin antibody (tgab), and thyroid morphology.  our results showed a weak negative correlation between se and antithyroid antibodies, suggesting that selenium supplementation may improve the course of thyroid autoimmunity.  in adults, selenium supplementation decreases thyroid peroxidase antibody (tpo ab) concentrations in patients with autoimmune thyroiditis (ait).  in areas with severe selenium deficiency higher incidence of thyroiditis has been reported due to a decreased activity of selenium-dependent glutathione peroxidase enzyme within thyroid cells.  selenium (se) is a trace element that plays key roles in thyroid physiology.  selenium (se) is a critical element in thyroid function, and variable dietary se intake influences immunity.  many studies showed selenium supplementation could decrease thyroid autoantibodies in patients with ait.  there appeared to be a positive correlation between the decreased rate of selenium levels and ft4/ft3 ratio, thereby indicating that patients with severe selenium deficiency also exhibited abnormal thyroid hormone levels. ||| ",Yes

Among advanced cancer patients with severe fatigue during treatment, a CBT intervention was more effective than usual care for reducing fatigue. The Tired Trial demonstrated CBT's significant and clinically relevant effects in reducing fatigue among patients with advanced cancer. Web-based mindfulness-based cognitive therapy has also been found effective in decreasing fatigue severity in patients suffering from chronic cancer-related fatigue. Patients who received CBT for post-cancer fatigue reported significantly less cognitive disability compared with those in the waiting list group.

Is butterfly rash a symptom of Systemic lupus erythematosus?,Yes,"Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a multisystem autoimmune disease characterized by general autoantibody production and a wide range of clinical manifestations. One of these manifestations is a butterfly rash, also known as a malar rash, which is a common facial manifestation of SLE. This rash is characterized by an erythematous rash that spreads across the cheeks and nose, resembling the shape of a butterfly. The butterfly rash is often one of the first signs of SLE and can be a helpful diagnostic tool for healthcare providers. However, it is important to note that other conditions, such as rosacea, can also produce a butterfly-like rash and must be ruled out before a diagnosis of SLE can be made.","systemic lupus erythematosus may produce a transient rash before any other signs.  sle was diagnosed on the basis of a butterfly rash, photosensitivity, nondeforming arthritis, pleuropericarditis, and alopecia.  the butterfly rash and malar flush are common facial manifestations of several disorders.  over a 42-month period, we encountered skin biopsy specimens from 23 anti-ro-positive patients who did not have scle: 15 had sle variably manifesting as scle-like rashes; malar erythema; a dermatomyositis-like rash; vascular disease involving cutaneous, cardiac, peripheral, and central nervous systems; restrictive pulmonary disease; periorbital edema; and myositis.  lupus vulgaris and lupus pernio produce nodules that may spread in a butterfly pattern, and seborrheic dermatitis has a predilection for the malar prominences and other areas of the face.  several conditions have clinical and laboratory features that can mimic those present in systemic lupus erythematosus (sle).  lupus erythematosus manifests as cutaneous variants, such as discoid lupus erythematosus or systemic lupus erythematosus.  some of these ""sle mimickers"" are very common, such as rosacea which can be mistaken for the butterfly rash, while others such as kikuchi disease, type-1 interferonopathies, castleman's disease, prolidase deficiency, angioimmunoblastic t-cell lymphoma, evans' syndrome in the context of primary immune deficiencies and the autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome are exceptionally uncommon.  cutaneous lupus erythematosus (cle) includes skin symptoms seen in sle and cutaneous-limited le.  lupus erythematosus (le) includes a broad spectrum of diseases from a cutaneous-limited type to a systemic type.  systemic lupus erythematosus is a multisystem autoimmune disease characterized by general autoantibody production and a wide range of mucocutaneous, renal, neuropsychiatric, cardiovascular, infectious, and hematologic manifestations.  the clinical manifestations of this disease include an erythematous rash, oral ulcers, polyarthralgia, nonerosive arthritis, polyserositis, hematologic, renal, neurologic, pulmonary and cardiac abnormalties.  bullous systemic lupus erythematosus (bsle) is a rare autoimmune subepidermal blistering disease with a female predominance characterized as an acute vesicobullous eruption in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (sle).  previous studies have demonstrated that ro/ssa antigen antibody might be involved in the pathogenesis of lupus erythematosus.  bullous systemic lupus erythematosus (bsle) is a rare cutaneous autoimmune disorder characterized by rapid, widespread vesiculobullous lesions in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (sle).  skin is one of the main target organs in lupus erythematosus and in some circumstances, skin lesions precede systemic manifestations.  two patients had primary sjögren syndrome, one had primary antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, and two had rheumatoid arthritis; all five had clinical evidence of cutaneous vasculopathy encompassing livedo, perniosis, and palpable purpura.  subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus (scle) is characterized by particular cutaneous manifestations such as non-scaring plaques mainly in sunlight exposed parts of the body along with specific serum autoantibodies (i.e.  systemic lupus erythematosus (sle) is a rare complex autoimmune disease with a multisystem involvement.  skin manifestations are frequent and sometimes vesiculobullous lesions may apper such as in bullous lupus erythematosus. ||| ",Yes
Is the Histidine-Rich Calcium Binding protein (HRC) related to arrhythmias and cardiac disease?,Yes,"The Histidine-Rich Calcium Binding protein (HRC) has been identified as a regulator of calcium homeostasis, playing a significant role in cardiac physiology and pathophysiology. The HRC gene encodes a histidine-rich calcium-binding protein found in the lumen of the junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum of cardiac and skeletal muscle. The HRC protein exhibits high-capacity calcium-binding properties and is involved in sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium uptake, storage, and release. The HRC ser96ala variant has been linked to ventricular arrhythmias and sudden death in dilated cardiomyopathy patients. This genetic variant increases the propensity of arrhythmogenic calcium waves in the stressed failing heart, suggesting a link between this variant and life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias in human carriers. Chronic overexpression of HRC, which may disrupt intracellular calcium homeostasis, is implicated in the pathogenesis of cardiac hypertrophy. HRC has also been linked with familial cardiac conduction disease and an HRC polymorphism has been shown to associate with malignant ventricular arrhythmias in the background of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy.","the histidine-rich calcium binding protein (hrc) ser96ala polymorphism was shown to correlate with ventricular arrhythmias and sudden death only in dilated cardiomyopathy patients but not in healthy human carriers.  the histidine-rich calcium-binding protein (hrc) ser96ala variant has previously been identified as a potential biomarker for ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death in patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy.  the ser96ala (s96a) mutation within the histidine rich ca(2+) binding protein (hrc) has recently been linked to cardiac arrhythmias in idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy patients, potentially attributable to an increase in spontaneous ca(2+) release events.  we hypothesized that the histidine-rich ca binding protein (hrc) in the sr may be involved in sr ca cycling and that alterations in hrc levels would result in abnormal cardiac ca homeostasis.  a human genetic variant (ser96ala) in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (sr) histidine-rich ca(2+)-binding (hrc) protein has been linked to ventricular arrhythmia and sudden death in dilated cardiomyopathy.  hrc (histidine-rich ca2+ binding protein) has been identified from skeletal and cardiac muscle and shown to bind ca2+ with low affinity and high capacity that is reminiscent of calsequestrin.  the histidine-rich calcium binding protein (hrc) is a regulator of ca2+-homeostasis.  the hrc gene encodes the histidine-rich calcium-binding protein, which is found in the lumen of the junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum (sr) of cardiac and skeletal muscle and within calciosomes of arterial smooth muscle.  the histidine-rich calcium-binding protein (hrc) is a regulator of ca2+ homeostasis and it plays a significant role in hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc) progression.  the histidine-rich calcium binding protein (hrc) is a novel regulator of sarcoplasmic reticulum (sr) ca(2+)-uptake, storage and release.  the histidine-rich ca(2+) binding protein (hrc) is a high capacity ca(2+) binding protein in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (sr).  these findings indicate that the hrc ser96ala variant increases the propensity of arrhythmogenic ca(2+) waves in the stressed failing heart, suggesting a link between this genetic variant and life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias in human carriers.  collectively, our results demonstrate that the human hrc mutation s96a leads to an increase in spontaneous ca(2+) release and ultimately arrhythmias by disrupting the regulation of intra-store free ca(2+).  this review summarizes studies, which have established the critical role of hrc in ca(2+)-homeostasis, suggesting its importance in cardiac physiology and pathophysiology.  collectively, these data suggest that hrc may be an integral regulatory protein involved in cardiac muscle sr ca uptake and ca homeostasis.  chronic overexpression of hrc that may disrupt intracellular ca(2+) homeostasis is implicated in pathogenesis of cardiac hypertrophy.  histidine-rich calcium binding protein (hrc) is located in the lumen of sarcoplasmic reticulum (sr) that binds to both triadin (trn) and serca affecting ca(2+) cycling in the sr.  increased cardiac hrc levels were associated with impaired sr ca uptake rates (35%) and attenuated cardiomyocyte ca transient decay (38%), without alterations in peak ca transients or sr ca load.  interestingly, hrc has been linked with familiar cardiac conduction disease and an hrc polymorphism was shown to associate with malignant ventricular arrhythmias in the background of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy.  the histidine-rich ca(2+)-binding protein (hrc) is located in the lumen of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (sr) and exhibits high-capacity ca(2+)-binding properties. ||| ",Yes
Is the SDHAF2 gene  encoding a protein necessary for flavination of SDHA?,Yes,"The context suggests that the SDHAF2 gene encodes a protein necessary for the flavination of SDHA. The increased levels of SDHAF2 indicate its role in stabilizing soluble FAD-SDH1. The impaired assembly of SDH with the C-terminal SDH1 mutants further supports the importance of FAD binding, which is facilitated by SDHAF2, in stabilizing SDH1 conformation and enabling its association with SDH2 and membrane anchor subunits. The SDH complex requires a covalent attachment of FAD on the ~70-kDa flavoprotein subunit SDH1 for its enzymatic function, and SDHAF2 appears to play a crucial role in this process.","to date, only an assembly factor (sdhaf2) required for fad insertion into subunit sdh1 has been identified in plants.  we conclude that sdhaf4 acts on fad-sdh1 and promotes its assembly with sdh2, thereby stabilizing sdh2 and enabling its full assembly with sdh3/sdh4 to form the sdh complex.  the increased levels of sdhaf2 suggest that the stabilization of soluble fad-sdh1 depends on sdhaf2 availability.  sdh assembly appears to require fad binding but not necessarily covalent fad attachment.  recent studies have indicated that post-translational flavinylation of succinate dehydrogenase subunit a (sdha) in eukaryotes and bacteria require the chaperone-like proteins sdh5 and sdhe, respectively.  with each mutant sdh1, second-site sdh1 suppressor mutations were recovered in sdh1 permitting flavinylation, stabilization of sdh5 and sdh tetramer assembly.  these results document the basis for the sdh deficiency and pathology seen with mutations in human sdh1.  we demonstrate that the fad assembly factor sdhe, which flavinylates and activates the respiratory enzyme succinate dehydrogenase (sdh), is also required for the complete activation and flavinylation of frd.  mass spectrometry analyses revealed stable levels of fad-sdh1 in sdhaf4, together with increased levels of the fad-sdh1 assembly factor, sdhaf2, and reduced levels of sdh2 compared with the wild type.  the impaired assembly of sdh with the c-terminal sdh1 mutants suggests that fad binding is important to stabilize the sdh1 conformation enabling association with sdh2 and the membrane anchor subunits.  loss of sdhaf4 in sdhaf4 inhibited the formation of the sdh1/sdh2 intermediate, leading to the accumulation of soluble sdh1 in the mitochondrial matrix and reduced levels of sdh1 in the membrane.  mutational analyses of sdh1 implicate c-terminal region arg residues involvement in covalent flavinylation and sdh assembly.  sdhe interacted with, and flavinylated, the flavoprotein subunit frda, whilst mutations in a conserved rgxxe motif impaired the complete flavinylation and activation of frd.  how does covalent flavinylation occur in prokaryotes, which lack sdhe homologs?  sdh assembly is dependent on fad binding to sdh1 but not covalent binding.  the fp subunit of succinate dehydrogenase was found to be the only (major) flavinylated protein in the cell.  the sdh complex consists of four core subunits and multiple cofactors, which must be assembled correctly to ensure enzyme function.  the enzymatic function of succinate dehydrogenase (sdh) is dependent on covalent attachment of fad on the ~70-kda flavoprotein subunit sdh1.  succinate dehydrogenase (sdh) requires a covalent addition of fad for catalytic function.  mutation of arg(638) compromises sdh function only when present in combination with a cys(630) substitution. ||| ",Yes
Can botulism poisoning of a pregnant woman harm her fetus?,Yes,"Justification: The context suggests that botulism poisoning during pregnancy can be harmful to the fetus. It is currently thought that toxins from botulism can pass through the placental barrier and damage the fetus directly, albeit at low concentrations. Furthermore, toxicological findings of the liver, brain, and kidney of the fetus revealed carbofuran in concentrations comparable with the mother's blood. Acute organophosphorus pesticide poisoning during pregnancy may lead to spontaneous abortion. Consequently, gestational lead poisoning is not only harmful to the woman but also to the developing fetus, invariably producing congenital lead poisoning. A case of carbamate pesticide poisoning of a pregnant woman by carbofuran ingestion is presented, and it has been suggested that snakebite poisoning during pregnancy may cause fetal loss. In a report, maternal typhoid fever with septic abortion caused the demise of the fetus due to trans-placental infection. Therefore, it can be concluded that botulism poisoning of a pregnant woman can harm her fetus.","given the natural physiological changes during pregnancy, pregnant women with botulism may experience a more exaggerated course and have worse outcomes compared to nonpregnant women.  maternal exposure during pregnancy to toxins can occasionally lead to miscarriage and malformation.  it is not uncommon for a medical provider caring for these women to mistakenly associate the signs and symptoms associated with botulism with pregnancy-related findings; therefore, this article illustrates a clinical algorithmic approach to caring for these women, including a systematic approach to establishing a diagnosis and management plan for pregnant women with botulism.  botulism is a severe neuroparalytic disease resulting from exposure to one of the most poisonous toxins to humans.  botulism is a dreadful, life-threatening, neuroparalytic disease caused by gram positive bacteria clostridium botulinum.  it is currently thought that toxins pass through the placental barrier, albeit bi-layered in the first trimester, and damage the fetus directly, albeit at low concentration.  toxicological findings of the liver, brain, and kidney of the fetus revealed carbofuran in concentrations comparable with the mother's blood.  acute organophosphorus pesticide poisoning during pregnancy may lead to spontaneous abortion.  botulism caused by toxins of clostridium botulinum and other neurotoxic clostridia is a rare but life-threatening disease with neurological symptoms.  envenomation during pregnancy can result in fetal and maternal death.  consequently, gestational lead poisoning is not only harmful to the woman but also to the developing fetus, invariably producing congenital lead poisoning.  botulinum neurotoxin serotype a (bonta) causes a life-threatening neuroparalytic disease known as botulism that could afflict large, unprotected populations if the toxin were employed in an act of bioterrorism.  a case of carbamate pesticide poisoning of a pregnant woman by carbofuran ingestion is presented.  it has been suggested that snakebite poisoning during pregnancy may cause fetal loss.  food borne botulism has been described following ingestion of preformed toxins in canned food or food products that have not been preserved properly.  botulism is a potentially fatal infection characterized by progressive muscle weakness, bulbar paralysis, constipation and other autonomic dysfunctions.  this article reviews the etiology, epidemiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and therapy of botulism.  this report documents a case of maternal typhoid fever with septic abortion, in which trans-placental infection of the fetus caused its demise.  food-borne botulism (food poisoning) is the most common type worldwide; rarely, wound botulism, infant botulism, or botulism of unknown etiology may also occur.  the mother recovered from the poisoning in the hospital but necrosis of the fetus was found. ||| ",No
Can glyburide reduce cerebral edema?,Yes,"The context suggests that glyburide, also known as glibenclamide, has been shown to reduce cerebral edema in both preclinical and clinical studies. Preclinical studies of traumatic brain injury and stroke models have demonstrated that glyburide reduces edema and hemorrhagic progression of contusions. In patients with large hemispheric infarction, intravenous glyburide has been associated with improvements in midline shift, level of alertness, and NIHSS, as well as a reduced proportion of deaths attributed to cerebral edema. Glyburide is thought to prevent brain swelling by inhibiting a non-selective channel composed of sulfonylurea receptor 1 and transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily m member 4. In a secondary analysis of the GAMES-RP trial, glyburide was found to be associated with a reduced T2 fluid-attenuated inversion recovery signal intensity ratio on brain MRI, diminished lesional water diffusivity, and reduced blood MMP-9 levels. These findings suggest that glyburide may be an effective treatment for reducing cerebral edema.","we hypothesize that treatment with rp-1127 (glyburide for injection) reduces formation of brain edema in patients after large anterior circulation infarction.  pre-clinical studies of traumatic brain injury (tbi) show that glyburide reduces edema and hemorrhagic progression of contusions.  however, treatment with iv glyburide was associated with a reduced proportion of deaths attributed to cerebral edema (n = 1  with iv glyburide vs n = 8  with placebo, p = 0.01).  preclinical models of stroke have shown that intravenous glyburide reduces brain swelling and improves survival.  several surrogate markers of vasogenic edema appear to be reduced in the setting of iv glyburide treatment in human stroke.  intravenous glyburide was well tolerated in patients with large hemispheric stroke at risk for cerebral oedema.  we assessed whether intravenous glyburide (rp-1127; glibenclamide) would safely reduce brain swelling, decrease the need for decompressive craniectomy, and improve clinical outcomes in patients presenting with a large hemispheric infarction.  glyburide is a safe, inexpensive, and efficacious alternative to dexamethasone for the treatment of cerebral metastasis-related vasogenic edema.  preclinical studies have shown that a continuous infusion of glyburide blocks edema formation and improves outcome.  this study provides class ii evidence that for patients with large hemispheric infarction, iv glyburide improves some edema-related endpoints.  glyburide is reported to prevent brain swelling in preclinical rodent models of ischemic stroke through inhibition of a non-selective channel composed of sulfonylurea receptor 1 and transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily m member 4.  inhibition of sulfonylurea receptor 1 (sur1) by glyburide has been shown to decrease edema after subarachnoid hemorrhage.  in this secondary analysis of the glyburide advantage in malignant edema and stroke (games-rp) trial, we report the effect of iv glyburide on adjudicated, edema-related endpoints.  preclinical and retrospective clinical data indicate that glyburide, a selective inhibitor of sulfonylurea receptor 1-transient receptor potential melastatin 4, is effective in preventing edema and improving outcome after focal ischemia.  iv glyburide was associated with improvements in midline shift, level of alertness, and nihss, and there were fewer deaths attributed to edema.  we report that iv glyburide was associated with t2 fluid-attenuated inversion recovery signal intensity ratio on brain mri, diminished the lesional water diffusivity between days 1 and 2 (pseudo-normalization), and reduced blood mmp-9 level.  glycerol has been used in cerebral edema for hyperosmolar dehydration of brain tissue, but only empirical relationships govern this use.  glycerol is a hyperosmolar agent that is claimed to reduce brain oedema.  to test the hypothesis that intravenous glibenclamide (glyburide; biib093) reduces ischemic brain water uptake, we quantified the lesional net water uptake (nwu) on serial ct scans from patients enrolled in the phase 2 games-rp trial (glyburide advantage in malignant edema and stroke).  in the subset of patients with malignant edema, those treated with iv glyburide had less midline shift (p < 0.01) and reduced mmp-9 (matrix metalloproteinase 9) levels (p < 0.01). ||| ",Yes
Are viruses involved in the etiology of human subacute thyroiditis?,Yes,"The evidence suggests that viruses are indeed involved in the etiology of human subacute thyroiditis. Subacute thyroiditis is generally believed to be of viral origin, with a variety of viruses such as coxsackie, cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, and adenovirus being implicated. The presence of viruses in the thyroid has been demonstrated, although their exact role in the development of thyroid diseases is still under investigation. Subacute thyroiditis is thought to be an inflammatory disease of the thyroid gland, most probably preceded by viral infection. The role of viruses in the pathogenesis of autoimmune thyroid diseases is, however, controversial.","viral infections are frequently cited as a major environmental factor involved in subacute thyroiditis and autoimmune thyroid diseases this review examines the data related to the role of viruses in the development of thyroiditis.  subacute thyroiditis is generally believed to be of viral origin, and infection is also suspected of playing a role as a triggering factor in the pathogenesis of autoimmune thyroid diseases.  most cases of subacute thyroiditis are caused by a variety of viruses, for example, coxsackie, cytomegalovirus, epstein-barr virus, and adenovirus.  from indirect and circumstantial evidence it would appear that subacute thyroiditis is probably a viral infection of the thyroid gland.  subacute thyroiditis is generally believed to be induced by viral infection, and little attention has been paid to anti-thyroid antibodies.  influenza immunization or infection may cause subacute thyroiditis.  the presence of viruses in the thyroid has been shown, but whether they are implicated in thyroid diseases or are only spectators is under investigation.  subacute thyroiditis is an inflammatory disease of the thyroid gland, most probably preceded by viral infection.  although viral infection is thought to be associated with subacute thyroiditis and probably with autoimmune thyroid disease, possible changes in thyroid function during the prodromal period of infection or subclinical infection remain largely unknown.  new data on viruses isolated from patients with subacute thyroiditis de quervain are reported.  although viral infection has been suspected as the cause of some thyroid disorders, there has been limited data to support this contention seriously.  these observations in an experimental model support the hypothesis that viruses may account for some thyroid disorders in man.  subacute (de quervain's) thyroiditis is a rare but important cause of fever of unknown origin.  subacute granulomatous thyroiditis is an inflammatory thyroid condition that is presumed to be caused by a viral infection or postviral inflammatory process.  the role of viruses in the pathogenesis of autoimmune thyroid diseases is controversial.  the aim of this study was to examine whether subacute thyroiditis triggers tsh receptor antibody-associated thyroid disorders.  this review summarizes our knowledge respecting the role of viral infection in the cause of hashimoto's thyroiditis.  the role of viruses as environmental triggers for hashimoto's thyroiditis (ht) is controversial.  on the other hand, subacute thyroiditis is a self-limited inflammatory disease of presumed viral aetiology.  subacute thyroiditis may trigger autoreactive b cells to produce tsh receptor antibodies, resulting in tsh receptor antibody-associated thyroid dysfunction in some patients. ||| ",Yes
Is clathrin involved in E-cadherin endocytosis?,Yes,"Justification: The context indicates that E-cadherin undergoes endocytosis via clathrin-coated vesicles in certain cell types, such as MDCK cells. This process is regulated by SMAP1, a clathrin-interacting GTPase-activating protein for the ADP-ribosylation factor 6 (ARF6) GTPase. The clathrin pathway is described as the principal route for receptor-mediated endocytosis and growth factor downregulation, with clathrin playing a crucial role as a scaffolding protein in this process. The formation of clathrin-coated vesicles from clathrin-coated pits is a key step in clathrin-mediated endocytosis, which retrieves extracellular molecules and cell surface components. Therefore, it can be concluded that clathrin is involved in E-cadherin endocytosis.","clathrin-mediated endocytosis (cme), in particular, involves the cytoplasmic protein clathrin which induces formation and internalization of clathrin-coated membrane buds that contain extra-cellular cargo.  e-cadherin is a central component of the adherens junction in epithelial cells and continuously undergoes endocytosis via clathrin-coated vesicles and/or caveolae depending on the cell type.  we examined the selective regulation of clathrin-dependent egfr signaling and endocytosis.  the existence of clathrin-coated buds on endosomes suggests that clathrin might mediate later endocytic trafficking events.  clathrin-mediated endocytosis (cme) occurs via the formation of clathrin-coated vesicles from clathrin-coated pits (ccps).  clathrin-mediated endocytosis is a major regulator of cell-surface protein internalization.  during clathrin-mediated endocytosis (cme), plasma membrane regions are internalized to retrieve extracellular molecules and cell surface components.  hsc70 is known to be involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis (cme) by which cells take up various extracellular materials.  thus, in mdck cells, e-cadherin appeared to be endocytosed solely through smap1-regulated clathrin-coated vesicles.  the clathrin pathway is the principal route for receptor-mediated endocytosis and growth factor downregulation.  in mammalian cells, clathrin plays a crucial role in this process as a scaffolding protein underlying the invaginating plasma membrane and surrounding the primary endocytic vesicle.  clathrin-coated vesicles execute receptor-mediated endocytosis at the plasma membrane.  in the central nervous system, clathrin-mediated endocytosis is crucial for efficient synaptic transmission.  clathrin plays important roles in intracellular membrane traffic including endocytosis of plasma membrane proteins and receptors and protein sorting between the trans-golgi network (tgn) and endosomes.  for endocytosis, the main adaptor is the adaptor protein (ap)-2 complex, but it is uncertain how clathrin contacts ap-2.  in this study, we examined the role of smap1, a clathrin-interacting gtpase-activating protein (gap) for the adp-ribosylation factor 6 (arf6) gtpase, in e-cadherin endocytosis.  collectively, smap1 likely represents a key arf6gap in clathrin dependent endocytosis of e-cadherin in mdck cells.  formation of the endophilin ii-ca(2+) channel complex is ca(2+)-dependent in clathrin-mediated endocytosis.  collectively, these data indicate a role for calcyon in clathrin-mediated endocytosis in brain.  clathrin-coated vesicles mediate a variety of endocytosis pathways in cells, including endocytic events at synapses. ||| ",Yes
Is STAT3 involved in EIF2AK2-dependent suppression of autophagy?,Yes,"The study suggests that STAT3 contributes to CRPC cell survival and chemoresistance by modulating autophagy. It is also noted that docetaxel-induced autophagy was inhibited by STAT3 activation, which in turn decreased CRPC cell viability. Furthermore, the phosphorylation of EIF2AK2 at specific sites has been shown to have both an essential and inhibitory effect on autophagy. Taken together, these findings suggest that STAT3 is involved in EIF2AK2-dependent suppression of autophagy.","we further showed that phosphorylation of eef2k at ser398 was essential for induction of autophagy, while phosphorylation of the kinase at ser366 and ser78 exerted an inhibitory effect on autophagy.  these results suggest that stat3 contributes to crpc cell survival and chemoresistance by modulating autophagy.  overall, this study reveals a novel regulatory role of the eif2α-atf4 pathway in the fine-tuning of the autophagy gene transcription program in response to stresses.  here, we establish that the eif2α/atf4 pathway directs an autophagy gene transcriptional program in response to amino acid starvation or endoplasmic reticulum stress.  we then investigated the mechanism by which tnfaip3 promotes autophagy signaling.  autophagy is a pro-survival pathway and can be regulated via the protein kinase-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (perk)/eif2α-mediated endoplasmic reticulum (er) stress pathway.  autophagy is inhibited by tor-dependent signaling.  we found that tak1 inhibits p70 s6 kinase1 (s6k1) phosphorylation by interfering interaction of raptor with s6k1, thus inducing autophagy.  transcription factor e3 (tfe3) is reported to be a crucial gene that regulates autophagy flux and lysosome function.  in some models s6k1 activity correlates with autophagy suppression, however, some other studies show that s6k1 promotes rather than inhibits this process.  the molecular mechanism underlying transforming growth factor-β activated kinase 1 (tak1)-induced autophagy is poorly understood.  the inhibition of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mtor) signaling pathway promotes the initiation of autophagy, and the mitogen-activated protein kinase (mapk)/extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (erk) is well known to induce autophagy.  in addition, we show that eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eef-2k) is also required for autophagy signaling during er stress, suggesting that phosphorylation of eef-2 may serve as an integrator of various cell stresses for autophagy signaling.  this study provides the first in vitro and in vivo evidence of tak1-induced autophagy and we believe that our findings significantly contribute to the understanding of the mechanisms underlying the induction of autophagy.  taken together, these findings establish that lysosomal accumulation of akt and phafin2 is a critical step in the induction of autophagy via an interaction with ptdins (3)p.  this study aimed to determine the interaction between autophagy and ire1α-jnk pathway on cell survival in response to er stress during the initial phase of hepatic steatosis.  the phosphorylation of the subunit alpha of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eif2alpha), a critical regulatory event in controlling protein translation, has recently been found to mediate the induction of autophagy.  to explore the molecular mechanisms of autophagy, we investigated the effect of tmp21.  signal transducer and activator of transcription (stat)3 expression is correlated with neoplasm growth, metastasis, and prognosis; it has also been implicated in the regulation of autophagy, which may in turn contribute to tumor chemoresistance.  meanwhile, docetaxel induced autophagy was inhibited by stat3 activation, which increased mitochondrial damage and decreased crpc cell viability. ||| ",Yes
Can sorafenib activate AMPK?,Yes,"The data presented in the context indicate that sorafenib can activate AMPK, an enzyme that plays a crucial role in cellular energy homeostasis. The study identifies sorafenib as an activator of AMPK, in a manner that involves either upstream LKB1 or CaMKK2. The combination of sorafenib with other AMPK activators, such as metformin, could potentially have beneficial effects on tumor regression by activating the AMPK pathway. Furthermore, a synergistic effect of both drugs is observed on the phosphorylation of the AMPKα activation site. These findings suggest that sorafenib can indeed activate AMPK.","these data suggest that the combination of sorafenib with ampk activators could have beneficial effects on tumor regression by ampk pathway activation.  here, we identify sorafenib as an activator of amp-activated protein kinase (ampk), in a manner that involves either upstream lkb1 or camkk2.  the combination of metformin or other ampk activators and sorafenib could be tested in prospective clinical trials.  sorafenib-inhibited raf-dependent signaling in crc cells, however, either did not affect the expression of akt or increased it.  a synergistic effect of both drugs is also seen on phosphorylation of the ampkα activation site.  furthermore, sorafenib pretreatment led to decreased phosphorylation levels of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (erk) and protein kinase b (akt) in smmc-7721 cells.  however, pi3k/akt signaling pathway is activated by sorafenib and cross-talks with the raf/mapk/erk signaling pathway, leading to drug resistance.  previous studies have shown sorafenib to function as a multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor in different tumors.  it is unknown whether ""paradoxical"" erk activation occurs after sorafenib therapy in hcc, and if so, if it impacts the therapeutic efficacy.  this study explored whether the efficacy of sorafenib can be improved by adding the mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (erk) kinase (mek) inhibitor ci-1040 to vertically block the raf/mek/erk pathway.  this study examined the sorafenib resistance mechanism.  sorafenib increased upa secretion, which was abrogated by an akt inhibitor.  in this study, we investigated whether sorafenib exerts an enhanced anticancer effect on crc cells via the calcium-mediated deactivation of the focal adhesion kinase (fak) signaling pathways.  patients were enrolled at escalating doses of sorafenib.  here, the effects of sorafenib on neuroinflammatory responses in vitro and in vivo and the underlying mechanisms were assessed.  sorafenib blocks signaling and synergizes with rapamycin in vivo, preventing tumor progression.  sorafenib is fda-approved for the treatment of primary kidney or liver cancer, but its ability to inhibit many types of kinases suggests it may have potential for treating other diseases.  sorafenib is a multi-target small molecule inhibitor of the raf kinase family and vegfr-2/pdgfr.  sorafenib induced the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways.  because most anticancer drugs act, at least in part, through the generation of reactive oxygen species, we investigated whether sorafenib can induce an oxidative stress. ||| ",Yes
Do normal cells express the protein TERT?,Yes,"In normal tissues, TERT is expressed in stem cells and progenitor cells, although its role in these compartments is not fully understood. TERT has been shown to act as a key factor in various biological processes, such as cell proliferation, via uncharacterized mechanisms. TERT protein levels are reduced with age, whereas in the nucleus TERT activity is increased. TERT is the protein component of telomerase, which serves to maintain telomere function through the de novo addition of telomere repeats to chromosome ends. However, TERT is also ubiquitously expressed in most human terminally differentiated cells, which don't have telomerase activity. The function of TERT in these cells is largely unknown.","in normal tissues, tert is expressed in stem cells and in progenitor cells, but its role in these compartments is not fully understood.  eighteen of the 63 cases were examined for tert mrna and the correlation with expression of tert protein was investigated.  tert has been shown to act as a key factor in various biological processes, such as cell proliferation, via uncharacterized mechanisms.  it was reported recently that tert is expressed in neurons throughout the brain in embryonic and early postnatal development, but is absent from neurons in the adult brain.  we evaluated the relationship between the analyzed tert genomic abnormalities and protein expression; however, no apparent relationship was observed.  tert protein levels are reduced with age, whereas in the nucleus tert activity is increased.  immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated tert expression in 31% of aitl, 11% of ptcl-nos, and 5% of atll.  tert, the protein component of telomerase, serves to maintain telomere function through the de novo addition of telomere repeats to chromosome ends, and is reactivated in 90% of human cancers.  in this study, the expression of tert was investigated by immunocytochemistry to determine whether it is a useful marker for differential diagnosis in benign or malignant breast tumors.  cases with mutation, detectable mrna expression, cn gain or hypermethylation were classified as tert aberrant, and these aberrancies were regularly found in ftc and ft-ump but uncommonly found in fta.  in conclusion, the expression of tert protein might be a useful marker for differential diagnosis in malignant and benign breast tumors.  telomerase reverse transcriptase (tert) is the protein component of telomerase complex.  tert is the main functional unit of telomerase, which maintains telomere length and chromosome structure stability.  however, terc is also ubiquitously expressed in most human terminally differentiated cells, which don't have telomerase activity.  terc is an rna component of telomerase.  it was found that tert and c-myc expression was observed mostly in malignancies and expression of c-myc was concordant for positivity and negativity with tert.  furthermore, immunostaining showed tert expression in the ptcl cytoplasm, suggesting the existence of mechanisms other than the maintenance of telomere length.  the function of terc in these cells is largely unknown.  statistical analysis of the effect of tert expression on the prognosis in ptcl cases revealed that tert expression tended to have a poor prognosis in ptcl-nos.  it was predicted that tert might play nontelomeric roles in the generation or development of some rare diseases, such as rift valley fever and dyscalculia. ||| ",No
Is the circadian clock involved in ribosome biogenesis?,Yes,"The circadian clock has been shown to extend its influence to ribosome biogenesis, as evidenced by the regulation of genes involved in ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) synthesis, assembly, and activation. The key circadian transcription factor, BMAL1, has been found to associate with the translational machinery in the cytosol and promote protein synthesis. Additionally, the circadian rhythm has been shown to regulate the formation of cytoplasmic processing (P) bodies, which control the fate of mRNAs, suggesting circadian coordination of mRNA metabolism and translation. Furthermore, protein synthesis rates have been found to demonstrate circadian oscillations dependent on BMAL1. These findings support the involvement of the circadian clock in ribosome biogenesis.","while the influence of the circadian clock has recently been shown to extend to ribosome biogenesis, the dynamics and regulation of the many small nucleolar rna that are required in pre-ribosomal rna folding and modification are unknown.  more broadly, these results expand the role of the circadian clock to the regulation of protein synthesis.  we have investigated the role of the circadian clock in the regulation of expression of genes required for ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (rubisco) synthesis, assembly, and activation.  little work has been done on circadian regulation of translation, so to address this deficit we conducted ribosome profiling experiments in a human cell model for an autonomous clock.  unexpectedly, we found that the clock also regulates the formation of cytoplasmic processing (p) bodies, which control the fate of mrnas, suggesting circadian coordination of mrna metabolism and translation.  the circadian clock in eukaryotes controls transcriptional and posttranscriptional events, including regulation of the levels and phosphorylation state of translation factors.  here, we show that the key circadian transcription factor bmal1 associates with the translational machinery in the cytosol and promotes protein synthesis.  in most organisms, circadian rhythms are generated by a molecular clockwork involving so-called clock genes.  the outcome is that ribonucleic acids (rnas) and proteins produced from many of these genes oscillate with a circadian rhythm.  the core oscillator generating circadian rhythms in eukaryotes is composed of transcription--translation-based autoregulatory feedback loops in which clock gene products negatively affect their own expression.  the circadian timing system synchronizes cellular function by coordinating rhythmic transcription via a transcription-translational feedback loop.  nevertheless, we found that translation occurs in a circadian fashion for many genes, sometimes imposing an additional level of control on rhythmically expressed mrnas and, in other cases, conferring rhythms on noncycling mrnas.  the circadian rhythm is originally generated by a transcription-translation based oscillatory loop composed of a set of clock genes in most organisms.  protein synthesis rates demonstrate circadian oscillations dependent on bmal1.  circadian rhythms allow organisms to time biological processes to the most appropriate phases of the day-night cycle.  using a novel computational method, we show that 18s and 28s pre-rrna are subject to circadian regulation in a nuclear rna sequencing time course.  protein synthesis is critical for circadian clock function, but little is known of how translational regulation controls the master pacemaker in mammals, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (scn).  we discovered, transcriptome-wide, extensive rhythms in ribosome occupancy and identified a core set of approximately 150 mrnas subject to particularly robust daily changes in translation efficiency.  post-transcriptional regulation is emerging as an important component of circadian networks, but the molecular mechanisms linking the circadian clock to the control of rna processing are largely unknown.  we found that most rhythmic gene expression occurs with little delay between transcription and translation, suggesting that the lag in the accumulation of some clock proteins relative to their mrnas does not arise from regulated translation. ||| ",Yes
Is Turcot syndrome associated with glioblastoma?,Yes,"Turcot syndrome is indeed associated with glioblastoma. This rare genetic disorder, also known as the glioma-polyposis syndrome, is characterized by colonic polyposis and central nervous system neoplasms, typically glioblastomas or medulloblastomas. The Type 1 variant of Turcot syndrome is particularly predisposed to glioblastoma. The association between Turcot syndrome and glioblastoma has been documented in numerous cases and is thought to be a result of the DNA mismatch repair deficiency inherent in the disorder.","turcot syndrome (ts) is a rare genetic disorder of dna mismatch repair predisposing to glioblastoma (gbm) in the type 1 variant.  here we describe three patients with turcot's syndrome, each having colorectal adenocarcinoma and malignant glioma.  turcot syndrome (ts) or the glioma-polyposis syndrome, is a rare, heritable disorder thought by some authors to be a variant of familial adenomatous polyposis (fap).  turcot's syndrome or the glioma polyposis syndrome is a rare variant of the polyposis syndrome and it is characterized by colonic polyposis and central nervous system neoplasm typically a glioblastoma or a medulloblastoma.  patients with turcot syndrome (ts) are predisposed to colon tumors and primary brain tumors, typically glioblastomas or medulloblastomas.  turcot's syndrome is a rare hereditary disease in which malignant glioma of the central nervous system is associated with colonic polyposis.  turcot syndrome represents the unique and discrete occurrence of polyposis coli with glioblastoma multiforme, medulloblastoma, or both.  turcot syndrome (ts) is a rare genetic disease in which brain tumors occur in association with colonic polyposis.  turcot's syndrome, the association of brain tumor (usually glioblastoma, medullo-blastoma, or astrocytoma) and colonic polyps, is a very rare condition of which about 20 cases have been reported.  turcot syndrome is characterized by an association of malignant brain tumors and colon cancer developing in the patient's teens.  turcot syndrome is clinically characterized by the occurrence of primary brain tumor and colorectal tumor and has, in previous reports, been shown associated with germline mutations in the genes apc, mlh1, mhs6, and pms2.  the turcot syndrome is a rare disease which is characterized by a combination of a brain tumor with a y at which the neoplasm of the colon.  turcot's syndrome represents the association between familial multiple polyposis coli and neural tumors.  turcot's syndrome is characterized clinically by the occurrence of primary brain tumor and colorectal tumor and has in previous reports been shown to be associated with germline mutations in the genes apc, hmlh1, and hpms2.  turcot's syndrome is a rare, genetically transmittable disease in which patients with colonic polyposis (possibly complicated by the progression to adenocarcinoma) have malignant central nervous system neoplasms.  turcot's syndrome is characterized clinically by the concurrence of a primary brain tumor and multiple colorectal adenomas.  multiple cns tumors are extremely unusual in turcot's syndrome.  turcot's syndrome is a combination of multiple adenomatous gastrointestinal polyps and neuroepithelial tumors of the central nervous system (cns).  we present a case of turcot's syndrome in a child with malignant transformation.  we report two new families with turcot syndrome to illustrate and review its characteristics and facilitate diagnosis. ||| ",Yes
Do statins cause diabetes?,Yes,"Numerous studies have indicated a correlation between statin use and an increased risk of new-onset diabetes. The diabetogenic action of statins is a concern, particularly for patients at high risk for diabetes receiving intensive statin therapy. The risk appears to be higher in patients who are insulin resistant, obese, or older. The effect of statins on diabetes risk extends to populations at high risk for diabetes, with a clear dose-response effect. The prevalence of statin-induced new-onset diabetes is estimated to be 7.03%. However, it is important to note that diabetes is also a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases, and the benefits of statins in reducing cardiovascular risk may outweigh the risk of developing diabetes in some patients.","background: previously conducted studies with statins shows an increased risk of developing new onset of diabetes.  statins may accelerate progression to diabetes via molecular mechanisms that impact insulin sensitivity and secretion.  increasing evidence suggests that statins might increase the risk of new-onset diabetes; however, diabetes is known to increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases.  however, patients prescribed statins have a higher background risk of diabetes.  this study helps in analyzing the risk of statins to cause new onset of diabetes.objective: to assess the prevalence, causality, severity, preventability and risk factors of statin-induced new onset of diabetes in dyslipidemic patients.methods: the study was conducted in a tertiary care hospital.  risk of diabetes was increased after statins, but outcomes were favorable.  in those predisposed to the development of diabetes (the insulin resistant, obese and older patients) statins may increase the risk of developing diabetes.  there is growing evidence to suggest that statin therapy is associated with an increased risk of incident diabetes.  however, statins are associated with excessive risk of diabetes occurrence according to clinical trial analyses.  our study indicated an association between statin use and an increased risk of new-onset diabetes mellitus.  statin use was associated with greater diabetes risk irrespective of treatment group, with pooled hr (95% ci) for incident diabetes of 1.36 (1.17 to 1.58).  the diabetogenic action of statins remains a concern, particularly in patients at high risk for diabetes receiving intensive statin therapy.  recent evidence, however, suggests that statins can increase the risk of new-onset diabetes (nod).  recent studies suggest that statins increase the risk of new-onset diabetes mellitus (nodm).  the effect of statins to increase diabetes risk appears to extend to populations at high risk for diabetes.  we aimed to assess whether statin use increases the risk of developing diabetes or affects overall mortality among normoglycemic patients and patients with impaired fasting glucose (ifg).  patients who developed statin-induced new onset of diabetes were managed by dose reduction and treatment with anti-diabetic medications.conclusion the prevalence of statin-induced new onset of diabetes is 7.03%.  recent studies suggest that statins increase the risk of subsequent diabetes with a clear dose response effect.  these findings further support the link between statin use and new-onset diabetes and suggest that the understanding of diabetes risk associated with different antihypertensive drug classes may bear practice modification.  the increased risk of new-onset diabetes with statin use, including high-potency statins, is well known. ||| ",Yes
Is there a relationship between junctin and ryanodine receptors?,Yes,"Junctin is a 26 kDa membrane protein that forms a quaternary complex with triadin, calsequestrin, and the ryanodine receptor (RyR) at the junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) membrane. Junctin is colocalized with the RyR and calsequestrin at the junctional SR membrane in cardiac and skeletal muscles. By binding directly to the RyR and calsequestrin, junctin may mediate the Ca(2+)-dependent regulatory interactions between both proteins. Overexpression of junctin led to down-regulation of triadin and RyR, but to up-regulation of the dihydropyridine receptor. The absence of junctin produces a dual effect on the normally linear response of RyRs to luminal Ca(2+): at low luminal Ca(2+) (<1 mmol L(-1)), junctin-devoid RyR channels are less responsive to luminal Ca(2+); conversely, high luminal Ca(2+) turns them hypersensitive to this form of channel modulation. These findings suggest that junctin plays a prominent role in cardiomyocyte Ca-cycling and contractility. The physiological role for junctin in the luminal regulation of RyR Ca(2+) release remains unresolved, but it appears to be essential for proper cardiac function since ablation of junctin results in increased ventricular automaticity.","junctin is one of the components of the ryanodine receptor ca release channel complex in sarcoplasmic reticulum.  junctin is a 26 kda membrane protein that binds to calsequestrin, triadin, and ryanodine receptors (ryrs) within the junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum of calcium release units.  junctin, a 26 kda intra-sarcoplasmic reticulum (sr) protein, forms a quaternary complex with triadin, calsequestrin and the ryanodine receptor (ryr) at the junctional sr membrane.  junctin is a 26-kda integral membrane protein, colocalized with the ryanodine receptor (ryr) and calsequestrin at the junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum (sr) membrane in cardiac and skeletal muscles.  junctin is a major transmembrane protein in cardiac junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum, which forms a quaternary complex with the ryanodine receptor (ca(2+) release channel), triadin, and calsequestrin.  in cardiac muscle, junctin forms a quaternary protein complex with the ryanodine receptor (ryr), calsequestrin, and triadin 1 at the luminal face of the junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum (jsr).  junctophilin-2 (jph2) is a cardiac specific member of the junctophilins, a newly characterized family of junctional membrane complex proteins important in physically approximating the plasmalemmal l-type calcium channel and the sarcoplasmic reticulum ryanodine receptor for calcium-induced calcium release.  by binding directly the ryr and calsequestrin, junctin may mediate the ca(2+)-dependent regulatory interactions between both proteins.  jph2 is believed to have an important role in sarcoplasmic reticulum (sr) ca(2+) handling and modulation of ryanodine receptor ca(2+) channels (ryr2).  overexpression of junctin led to down-regulation of triadin and ryr but to up-regulation of dihydropyridine receptor.  thus, junctin produces complex effects on ca(2+) sparks, transients, and leak, but the luminal -dependent dual response of junctin-devoid ryrs demonstrates that junctin normally acts as an activator of ryr channels at low luminal , and as an inhibitor at high luminal .  the levels of two other junctional sr-proteins, the ryanodine receptor and triadin, were reduced by 32% and 23%, respectively.  because the crossover occurs at a (sr) that is close to that present in resting cells, it is possible that the activator-inhibitor role of junctin may be exerted under periods of prevalent parasympathetic and sympathetic activity, respectively.  single channel recordings of ryrs from wt and jcn-ko cardiac sr indicate that the absence of junctin produces a dual effect on the normally linear response of ryrs to luminal : at low luminal  (<1 mmol l(-1)), junctin-devoid ryr channels are less responsive to luminal ; conversely, high luminal  turns them hypersensitive to this form of channel modulation.  we conclude that the increase in junctin expression affects the packing of calsequestrin in the junctional sr and facilitates the association of sr and t tubules.  these findings suggest that junctin plays a prominent role in cardiomyocyte ca-cycling and contractility.  the physiological role for junctin in the luminal regulation of ryr ca(2+) release remains unresolved, but it appears to be essential for proper cardiac function since ablation of junctin results in increased ventricular automaticity.  this study sought to study the role of junctophilin-2 (jph2) in atrial fibrillation (af).  junctin ablation appears to affect how ryrs 'sense' sr ca(2+) load, resulting in decreased diastolic sr ca(2+) leak despite an elevated (sr).  our data provide evidence that cardiac-specific overexpression of junctin is accompanied by impaired myocardial relaxation with prolonged ca(2+) transient kinetics on the cardiomyocyte level. ||| ",Yes
Could divalent metal transporter 1 deficiency lead to anemia?,Yes,".

     Justification: The divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1) is a major iron transporter that plays a critical role in iron absorption and erythropoiesis. DMT1 is responsible for the uptake of iron into duodenal enterocytes and for transferring iron from the endosome into the cytosol after cellular uptake via the transferrin receptor. Mutations in DMT1 can cause systemic iron deficiency and anemia. The n491s mutation in DMT1, for example, has been shown to contribute to the development of anemia and hepatic iron overload. Therefore, deficiency of DMT1 can lead to anemia.","deficiency of the divalent metal transporter 1 (dmt1) leads to hypochromic microcytic anemia.  divalent metal-ion transporter 1 (dmt1) has been found to play an important role in the iron metabolism and hemogenesis.  besides iron, divalent metal-ion transporter 1 also transports other divalent metals.  the divalent metal transporter 1 (dmt1) is a major iron transporter required for iron absorption and erythropoiesis.  divalent metal transporter 1 (dmt1) is the major iron transporter responsible for duodenal dietary iron absorption and is required for erythropoiesis.  divalent metal-ion transporter-1 (dmt1) is a h(+)-coupled metal-ion transporter that plays essential roles in iron homeostasis.  divalent metal-ion transporter-1 (dmt1) is a widely expressed iron-preferring membrane-transport protein that serves a critical role in erythroid iron utilization.  divalent metal ion transporter 1 (dmt1) is a proton-coupled fe(2+)transporter that is essential for iron uptake in enterocytes and for transferrin-associated endosomal iron transport in many other cell types.  divalent metal-ion transporter-1 (dmt1) is a widely expressed, iron-preferring membrane transport protein.  the divalent metal transporter 1 (dmt1) is a multimetal transporter with a primary role in iron transport.  divalent metal transporter 1 (dmt1) mediates apical iron uptake into duodenal enterocytes and also transfers iron from the endosome into the cytosol after cellular uptake via the transferrin receptor.  trace metals influence the absorption of each other from the diet and it has been suggested that the divalent metal transporter (dmt1) represents a common uptake pathway for these important micronutrients.  iron is taken into enterocytes at the duodenum via apical divalent metal-ion transporter 1 protein.  hence, mutations in dmt1 cause systemic iron deficiency and anemia.  the major transport protein responsible for uptake of iron is divalent metal transporter 1 (dmt1) and recent studies demonstrate that the 1b species is regulated post-translationally by degradation via the proteasomal pathway.  overexpression of duodenal divalent metal transporter (dmt1) messenger rna occurs in hemochromatosis and hfe-knockout mice, suggesting that dmt1 mediates enhanced absorption of iron; however, increased expression of functional dmt1 protein has yet to be substantiated.  divalent metal transporter 1 (dmt1) is a transmembrane glycoprotein which mediates the proton-coupled transport of a variety of divalent metal ions.  our data confirm the major role of dmt1 in the maintenance of iron homeostasis in humans and demonstrate that the n491s mutation, through its deleterious effect on protein trafficking, contributes together with the g212v mutation to the development of anemia and hepatic iron overload.  divalent metal-ion transporter 1 (dmt1) may transport copper, but studies to date on this topic have been equivocal.  iron-copper model: mutations in the divalent metal transporter 1 (dmt1) decrease body iron status and up-regulate copper absorption, which leads to copper loading in the brain and consequently increases metal-induced oxidative stress. ||| ",Yes

Is dasatinib effective for treatment of glioblastoma?,Yes,"The results indicate that dasatinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, has been evaluated for use in numerous cancers, including glioblastoma. In vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated inhibition of glioblastoma growth by dasatinib. The combination of dasatinib and temozolomide, a chemotherapy drug, has been shown to result in a significant increase in cell cycle disruption and autophagic cell death in glioma cells. Furthermore, a retrospective analysis of patients with recurrent glioblastoma who underwent apatinib plus temozolomide treatment was performed, indicating the potential use of dasatinib in combination therapy for glioblastoma.","these results strongly support the clinical use of dasatinib in the treatment of glioblastoma and provide a rationale for combination therapy with dasatinib and temozolomide.  dasatinib, a new-generation src and platelet-derived growth factor receptor (pdgfr) inhibitor, is currently under evaluation in high-grade glioma clinical trials.  in vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated inhibition of glioblastoma growth by imatinib mesylate (gleevec).  in this phase i study of recurrent glioblastoma patients, the combination of ccnu and dasatinib showed significant hematological toxicities and led to suboptimal exposure to both agents.  gefitinib, a selective epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, is under clinical testing and use in cancer patients, including glioma.  background: although programmed death-1 (pd-1) blockade is effective in treating several types of cancer, the efficacy of this agent in glioblastoma (gbm) is largely unknown.  it has also been evaluated in several clinical trials for treatment of brain tumors such as high-grade glioma.  in conclusion, darapladib acts as a potential anti-glioma compound via the induction of mitochondrial membrane depolarization and cell apoptosis, and the inhibition of akt signaling in glioma cells.  this open-label, phase ii trial evaluated cabozantinib in patients with recurrent or refractory glioblastoma (gbm).  dasatinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, has been approved for first-line treatment of leukemia and has also been evaluated for use in numerous other cancers.  here we retrospectively assessed the efficacy and toxicity of temozolomide plus apatinib, an oral small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor targeting vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 in recurrent glioblastoma.  epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors, including gefitinib, have been evaluated in patients with malignant gliomas.  in studying the action of dasatinib in human glioblastoma, we found that levels of phospho-src, akt, and ribosomal protein s6 were decreased in cell lines treated with low nanomolar concentrations of dasatinib at baseline and following stimulation with epidermal growth factor.  imatinib is an inhibitor of the tyrosine kinase activities of platelet-derived growth factor receptor (pdgf-r), which is involved in glioblastoma aggressiveness.  to determine the maximum tolerated dose (mtd) and dose-limiting toxicity (dlt) of dasatinib, an inhibitor of the src family kinase proteins, with erlotinib, an epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, among recurrent malignant glioma patients.  dasatinib is a new selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets certain kinases involved in cellular growth and development.  combination treatment of glioma cells with dasatinib and temozolomide resulted in a significant increase in cell cycle disruption and autophagic cell death.  a retrospective analysis of patients with recurrent glioblastoma who underwent apatinib plus temozolomide treatment was performed.  treatment for recurrent glioblastoma is poor, and there is a need for better therapies.  we used a novel fluorinated dasatinib derivative (f-ski249380), in combination with nanocarrier vehicles and metabolic imaging tools (micropet) to evaluate drug delivery and uptake in a platelet-derived growth factor b (pdgfb)-driven genetically engineered mouse model (gemm) of high-grade glioma. ||| ",No
Is alternative splicing of apoptotic genes playing a role in the response to DNA or mitochondrial damage?,Yes,"Alternative splicing of apoptotic genes has been shown to play a significant role in the response to DNA damage. This process generates splice variants that can antagonize normal transcripts, leading to the production of proteins with distinct and even opposing functions in apoptotic pathways. DNA damage has been found to induce changes in alternative splicing, and in turn, alternative splicing can modulate the DNA damage response. Genome-wide alternative splicing profiling has revealed extensive changes in DNA damage-related processes such as cell cycle control and DNA damage repair. Furthermore, alternative splicing of genes like caspase-2 has been observed in response to proapoptotic stimuli. This process often results in the formation of functionally different products, some of which have antagonistic effects on cell death. Therefore, alternative splicing is not only involved in the regulation of apoptosis but also in the fine-tuning of programmed cell death in response to DNA damage.","a number of genes related to apoptosis undergo alternative splicing.  alternative splicing plays an important role in the control of apoptosis.  some apoptosis-regulating genes also undergo alternative splicing, generating splice variants that antagonzie normal transcripts on apoptosis.  it has long been suggested that alternative splicing is involved in regulation of apoptosis by producing mrna isoforms that encode proteins with distinct and even opposite functions in apoptotic pathways.  alternative splicing and dna damage exhibit cross-regulation, with not only dna damage inducing changes in alternative splicing, but alternative splicing itself possibly modulating the dna damage response (ddr).  genome-wide alternative splicing profiling was performed upon dna damage induction and sirt1 deletion.  transcriptional modification by alternative splicing is known to be involved in the regulation of programmed cell death.  here, we explore further this dna damage-dependent alternative splicing.  here, we explore further this dna damage-dependent alternative splicing.  alternative splicing plays important roles in regulating genes critical for cell death.  bcl-x) code for alternatively spliced protein variants with opposing functions, the manipulation of alternative splicing presents a unique way of regulating the apoptotic response.  these studies have provided new evidence supporting the important role of regulated splicing and sr proteins in the process of apoptosis.  studies using molecular, biochemical, and systems-based approaches have begun to reveal mechanisms underlying the regulation of alternative splicing of cell death genes.  differential alternative splicing can affect expression, subcellular distribution, and functional activities of the gene products.  dna damage caused genome-wide changes in alternative splicing in adult nscs and sirt1 deficiency dramatically altered ddr-related alternative splicing.  in this study, we investigated the effect of proapoptotic stimuli on alternative splicing of caspase-2 mrna in u937 cells.  in particular, extensive alternative splicing changes in ddr-related processes such as cell cycle control and dna damage repair were observed; these processes were dramatically influenced by sirt1 deficiency.  alternative splicing of these genes often leads to the formation of functionally different products, some of which have antagonistic effects that are either cell death-promoting or cell death-preventing.  in conclusion, alternative splicing might be involved in functional fine-tuning of trail-induced programmed cell death.  recently, it was demonstrated that inactivation of a single sr protein, asf/sf2, can modulate a specific step in the apoptotic pathway, internucleosomal dna fragmentation, by regulating icad pre-mrna alternative splicing. ||| ",Yes
Is Cryptococcus neoformans a frequent cause of isolated skin infections in immunocompromised individuals,No,"Cryptococcus neoformans is a frequent cause of infections in immunocompromised individuals, with the infection often presenting as a systemic fungal infection known as cryptococcosis. The infection can affect various organs, including the lungs, central nervous system, and skin. However, it is not a frequent cause of isolated skin infections in immunocompromised individuals. The majority of cases of cryptococcosis in immunocompromised individuals present with meningitis, pneumonia, and/or disseminated disease, with skin lesions being a less common manifestation. The presence of skin lesions in cryptococcosis is often indicative of disseminated disease, and if not treated properly, can result in life-threatening consequences.

Can valproic acid act as an activator of AMPK?,Yes,"Valproic acid has been established as an in vitro activator of AMPK. Studies have shown that treatment of hepatocytes with metabolites of valproic acid resulted in increased phosphorylation of AMPK/ACC, indicating its activation. Furthermore, valproic acid, like trichostatin A, also activates transcription from diverse exogenous and endogenous promoters.

Is the consumption of chocolate associated with an increase in cardiovascular disease?,No,"The consumption of chocolate has been shown to have potential beneficial effects with respect to heart disease. Accumulating evidence suggests potential preventive effects of chocolate/cocoa on the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD).

Instead, it discusses the roles of various other genes and proteins, such as pbx1, dlx3, pax3, pax6, lhx3, and loxl3, in mouse development and embryogenesis. Therefore, based on the given context, it cannot be concluded that POLD3 is essential for mouse development.","experimentation with pbx1 knockout mice has shown that pbx1 is necessary for early embryogenesis.  dlx3, a homeodomain transcription factor, is essential for placental development in the mouse.  here, we investigated how its absence alters the trajectory of postnatal brain development using as model the pallid mouse.  pax transactivation domain-interacting protein (ptip, or paxip1) is required for mouse development and has been implicated in dna damage responses and histone modification.  the dlx3(-/-) mouse embryo dies at embryonic d 9.5-10 putatively due to placental failure.  the paired-box homeodomain transcription factor pax3 is a key regulator of the nervous system, neural crest and skeletal muscle development.  because patch mouse mutants which fail to express pdgf alpha-receptor also have rib abnormalities, we sought to determine whether pax3 may influence the expression of this receptor.  dlx3-null mice die by embryonic day 10.0 due to placental failure.  the homeodomain protein distal-less 3 (dlx3) is essential for normal placental development in mice.  taken together, these data suggest that pax6 is not essential for pituitary differentiation, but rather functions to establish appropriate neonatal homeostatic levels of gh and prl, possibly through regulation of translational or secretory mechanisms.  the expression pattern of lhx3 is well conserved between xenopus and mouse, underscoring the functional importance of this gene as a regulator of development.  we concluded that the loss of loxl3 attenuates mouse embryonic lung development.  we have used the splotch mouse which has a mutation in the pax3 gene to determine what role pax3 may play in rib morphogenesis.  dlx3 is specifically required for full expression and secretion of pgf in vivo.  p-lim (lhx3a) is a lim homeodomain transcription factor essential for pituitary development and motor neuron specification in mice.  mdm2-conditional col3.6-cre mice die at birth and display multiple skeletal defects.  moreover, in vitro studies support the conclusion that dlx3 is sufficient to directly modulate expression of the pgf gene promoter in placental cells.  lysyl oxidase-like 3 (loxl3), a human disease gene candidate, is a member of the lysyl oxidase (lox) family and is indispensable for mouse palatogenesis and vertebral column development.  in this study, we investigated a possible role for loxl3 in mouse embryonic lung development.  lhx3/lim-3/p-lim is a lim homeodomain transcription factor which is essential in mice for the development of anterior and intermediate lobes of the pituitary gland. ||| ",Yes
Does thyroid hormone regulate calcium transient in the myocardium?,Yes,"The context indicates that thyroid hormone regulates calcium transient in the myocardium.

The results of various studies show that thyroid hormone regulates the efficiency and expression of sarco-endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPases in cardiac and skeletal muscle. Furthermore, the effects of thyroid hormone on the cytosolic free calcium concentration in myotubes and isolated ventricular rat myocytes have been studied. These findings suggest that thyroid hormone plays a crucial role in the regulation of calcium transient in the myocardium.","we conclude that (1) thyroid hormone increases neither the o2-consumption rate nor the level of i of resting cardiomyocytes and (2) the effects of the beta-receptor-agonist isoproterenol on ca2+ transients of electrically stimulated myocytes, are inversely related to the documented changes in beta-receptor density in heart tissue occurring with alterations in the thyroid state.  mechanisms underlying thyroid hormone-induced changes in myocardial contractile state were investigated by studying the effects of triiodothyronine (t3) on ca2+ fluxes across the sarcolemmal membrane and ca2+ handling by the sarcoplasmic reticulum, using spontaneously contracting monolayers of cultured chick embryo ventricular cells.  our results provide the first evidence that changes in cardiac contractility associated with altered thyroid state not only involve effects on ca2+, but may also involve changes in the response of the myofilaments to cai2+mediated by altered phi and nai+.  thyroid hormone (th) receptors are present in the myocardium and vascular tissue, and minor alterations in th concentration can affect cardiovascular (cv) physiology.  the cardiac transient outward current i(to) is regulated by thyroid hormone (t3).  these results indicate that the status of sarcolemmal ca(2+)-transport processes is regulated by thyroid hormones and the modification of ca(2+)-fluxes across the sarcolemmal membrane may play a crucial role in the development of thyroid state-dependent contractile changes in the heart.  thyroid-related hormones regulate the efficiency and expression of sarco-endoplasmic reticulum calcium atpases in cardiac and skeletal muscle.  in order to examine the regulatory role of thyroid hormone on sarcolemmal ca(2+)-channels, na(+)-ca2+ exchange and ca(2+)-pump as well as heart function, the effects of hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism on rat heart performance and sarcolemmal ca(2+)-handling were studied.  what is the consequence of hyperthyroidism for mitochondrial metabolism and ca(2+) handling of the postischaemic stunned heart?  it has been previously shown that modification of thyroid hormone levels have a profound impact on cardiac function, predominantly through a direct regulation of the sarcoplasmic reticulum protein levels.  the purpose of this study was to determine whether the cardiac contractile abnormalities induced by hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism are caused by changes in intracellular ca2+ handling or by alterations in the distribution of isoenzymes of ventricular myosin.  it is tempting to speculate that thyroid hormones also alter calcium concentration and thus influence the process of excitation-contraction coupling in the skeletal muscle.  we have tested the hypothesis that thyroid state may influence both the flow of cellular ca2+ and the myofilament response to ca2+ by effects on intracellular ph (phi) and na+ (nai+).  thyroid hormone has been shown to modulate the gene expression of cardiac potassium channels, however, it is not known if gene expression is different between the atrium and the ventricle.  these findings indicate that (1) thyroid hormones induce similar changes in the cardiac sr ca2+-atpase levels in either the presence or absence of phospholamban, (2) the thyroxine-induced increases in sr ca2+-atpase levels are not associated with any further stimulation of the hyperdynamic cardiac function in phospholamban-deficient mice, and (3) the decreased contractile parameters in hypothyroid phospholamban-deficient hearts associated with decreases in sr ca2+-atpase levels and myosin heavy chain isoform switches are at least as high as those of the stimulated hyperthyroid wild-type hearts.  hyperthyroidism is a cardiac risk factor, but thyroid therapy is used on myocardial stunning.  alterations in intracellular ca2+ handling alone may account for the contractile changes induced by hypothyroidism.  the effect of thyroid hormone (l-tri-iodothyronine; t3) on the cytosolic free ca2+ concentration (i) in l6 myotubes was studied at rest and during activation to explore the possible mediating role of i in the t3-induced net synthesis of fast-type sarcoplasmic reticulum (sr) ca(2+)-atpase.  we therefore investigated the effects of t3 on intracellular calcium transients and contractile performance in isolated ventricular rat myocytes.  studies with isolated-perfused hearts showed that while hypothyroidism did not modulate the inotropic response to extracellular ca2+ and ca2+ channel blocker verapamil, hyperthyroidism increased sensitivity to ca2+ and decreased sensitivity to verapamil in comparison to euthyroid hearts. ||| ",Yes
Are mouse chromosomes acrocentric?,Yes,"The mouse mus musculus chromosomes are all acrocentric, with each centromere adjacent to a telomere. This is a characteristic karyotypic feature of mouse chromosomes, which also includes the presence of large blocks of heterochromatin in the vicinity of the centromeres.

Are Conserved Nonexonic Elements (CNEEs) important in phylogenomics research?,Yes,"Conserved Nonexonic Elements (CNEEs) have been identified as promising phylogenomic markers due to their evolutionary properties. They exhibit slower evolution than the neutral rate across species and are less variable than bioinformatically derived UCEs or introns. Despite their lower variability, CNEEs yield phylogenetic resolution as high as for UCEs and introns, with fewer gaps and less ambiguity in alignments. Their patterns of nucleotide substitution are also more consistent with the assumptions of commonly used methods of phylogenetic analysis. Therefore, CNEEs are considered important in phylogenomics research.","highly conserved noncoding elements (cnes) constitute a significant proportion of the genomes of multicellular eukaryotes.  here we analyze and study the evolutionary properties of a new type of noncoding marker, conserved nonexonic elements (cnees), which consists of noncoding elements that are estimated to evolve slower than the neutral rate across a set of species.  conserved noncoding elements (cnes) are elements exhibiting extreme noncoding conservation in metazoan genomes.  conserved noncoding elements (cnes) have a significant regulatory influence on their neighboring genes.  conserved noncoding elements (cnes) constitute the majority of sequences under purifying selection in the human genome, yet their function remains largely unknown.  conserved noncoding elements (cncs) are an abundant feature of vertebrate genomes.  although conserved noncoding elements (cnes) constitute the majority of sequences under purifying selection in the human genome, they remain poorly understood.  overall, cnees appear to be promising as phylogenomic markers, yielding phylogenetic resolution as high as for uces and introns but with fewer gaps, less ambiguity in alignments and with patterns of nucleotide substitution more consistent with the assumptions of commonly used methods of phylogenetic analysis.  the distribution of these conserved non-coding elements (cne) within and across genomes has suggested that many of them may have roles as transcriptional regulatory elements.  these elements, collectively referred to as conserved non-coding elements (cnes), are non-randomly distributed across chromosomes and tend to cluster in the vicinity of genes with regulatory roles in multicellular development and differentiation.  scarce work has been done in the analysis of the composition of conserved non-coding elements (cnes) that are identified by comparisons of two or more genomes and are found to exist in all metazoan genomes.  cnes display sequence properties that set them apart from other sequences under constraint, and have recently been proposed as useful markers for the reconstruction of the evolutionary history of organisms.  using a data set of 16 birds plus an alligator outgroup, and ∼3600-∼3800 loci per marker type, we found that although cnees were less variable than bioinformatically derived uces or introns and in some cases exhibited a slower approach to branch resolution as determined by phylogenomic subsampling, the quality of cnee alignments was superior to those of the other markers, with fewer gaps and missing species.  conserved, ultraconserved and other classes of constrained elements (collectively referred as cnes here), identified by comparative genomics in a wide variety of genomes, are non-randomly distributed across chromosomes.  conserved non-coding sequences (cnss) of eukaryotes are known to be significantly enriched in regulatory sequences.  however, since the identification of conserved elements (ces) has been restricted to a limited number of model organisms, the dynamics and evolutionary character of the genomic landscape of conserved, and hence likely functional, sequence is poorly understood in most species.  conserved non-coding sequences (cns) are islands of non-coding sequence that, like protein coding exons, show less divergence in sequence between related species than functionless dna.  to gain new insights into the extreme selection of highly conserved noncoding elements (hcnes), we used a systematic analysis of multi-omic data to study the epigenetic regulation of such elements during the development of drosophila melanogaster.  here, we search for cnes among the ancestral repeat classes in the human genome and report the discovery of a large cne family containing >900 members.  the approach taken here based on the use of a progressive cactus whole-genome alignment to identify ces should be readily applicable to nonmodel organisms in general and help to reveal the rich repertoire of putatively functional noncoding sequence as targets for selection. ||| ",Yes
Are Notch mutations related to T-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (T-ALL)?,Yes,"Notch mutations, particularly in Notch1, are frequently observed in T-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (T-ALL). These mutations are often activating, leading to aberrant downstream signaling. The Notch signaling pathway is crucial in T-cell development, and its deregulation plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of T-ALL. Notch1 mutations are found in over 50% of T-ALL cases, making them one of the most common molecular events in this disease. Furthermore, Notch3 overexpression is also implicated in T-ALL, contributing to aberrant Notch signaling.","notch1 mutations are found in more than 50% of human t cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (t-all) cells.  activating mutations in notch1, an essential regulator of t cell development, are frequently found in human t cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (t-all).  t-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (t-all), unlike other all types, is only infrequently associated with chromosomal aberrations, but it was recently shown that most individuals with t-all carry activating mutations in the notch1 gene.  the notch signaling pathway is crucial in t-cell development, notch1 mutations are frequently present in t-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (t-all).  activating notch1-mutations, leading to aberrant downstream signaling, have been identified in human t-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (t-all).  the notch pathway is highly active in almost all patients with t-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (t-all), but the implication of notch ligands in t-all remains underexplored.  the notch pathway is frequently activated in t-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias (t-alls).  notch signaling is of crucial importance in normal t-cell development and notch 1 is frequently mutated in t-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias (t-all), leading to aberrantly high notch signaling.  oncogenic notch1 mutations are found in most t-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemias in humans and t-cell lymphomas in mice.  in t-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (t-all) notch 1 receptors are frequently mutated.  t-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (t-all) patients frequently display notch1 activating mutations and notch can transcriptionally down-regulate the tumor suppressor pten.  notch pathway activation by mutations in either notch1 and/or fbxw7 is one of the most common molecular events in t-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (t-all) and, in pediatric disease, predicts for favorable outcome.  the notch3 receptor is frequently expressed in t-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (t-all).  aberrant notch signaling represents an important oncogenic mechanism for t cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (t-all), an aggressive subset of the most common malignant childhood cancer all.  higher expression of notch1 was associated with notch1 mutation, more novel mutation of this gene might be identified in different populations and its contribution to the molecular pathogenesis of t-all is needed further research.  t-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (t-all) is an aggressive blood cancer caused by the deregulation of key t-cell developmental pathways, including notch signaling.  activating lesions frequently affect notch1 in t-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (t-all) and, recently, have been found in non-small-cell lung cancer (nsclc) as well.  notch signaling, which is driven by the notch1 receptor, plays an essential role in the pathogenesis and stroma-mediated drug resistance of t-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (t-all).  notch signaling is often considered a model hematopoietic proto-oncogene because of its role as the main trigger of t cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (t-all).  aberrant notch signaling in t-all occurs by notch1 gain-of-function mutations and by notch3 overexpression. ||| ",Yes
Are the genes for marneral biosynthesis scattered in the genome of A. thaliana?,No,"The context indicates that the gene encoding cyp71a16, which is involved in the biosynthesis and modification of the triterpenoid marneral, is part of a gene cluster in A. thaliana. This suggests that the genes for marneral biosynthesis are not scattered in the genome, but rather are organized in a cluster. This is further supported by the mention of biosynthetic gene clusters (bgcs) in plant genomes, which are groups of genes that are physically clustered together and involved in the biosynthesis of a specific compound. Therefore, it can be inferred that the genes for marneral biosynthesis are not scattered in the genome of A. thaliana.","previous investigations of a. thaliana have revealed that cyp71a16 catalyzes marneral oxidation, while it also can accept marnerol as substrate.  the arabidopsis thaliana gene encoding cyp71a16 is part of the gene cluster for the biosynthesis and modification of the triterpenoid marneral.  a. thaliana contains four malic enzymes (nadp-me 1-4) to catalyze the reversible oxidative decarboxylation of malate in the presence of nadp.  cyp71a16 catalyzed the hydroxylation of marnerol to 23-hydroxymarnerol with a km of 142μm and a kcat of 3.9min-1.  here, we examine a large number of variants within and between species for a paradigm bgc (the thalianol cluster), which has evolved recently in a common ancestor of the arabidopsis genus.  a heterologous bacterial redox partner system consisting of the flavodoxin ykun from bacillus subtilis and the flavodoxin reductase fpr from e. coli clearly outperformed the cytochrome p450 reductase atr2 from a. thaliana in supporting the cyp71a16-mediated hydroxylation of marnerol.  in view of the application potential of floral parts in secondary metabolite extraction, we characterized for the first time the floral transcriptomes of two key m. malabathricum varieties, purple variety and white variety.  our results provide new insights into the complex regulation of pa and anthocyanin biosynthesis in m. truncatula.  here, we have aimed to sequence the plastid genome of a. marina and its comparison with related species in family acanthaceae.  numerous examples of biosynthetic gene clusters (bgcs), including for compounds of agricultural and medicinal importance, have now been discovered in plant genomes.  expression of these enzymes in wild tobacco (nicotiana benthamiana) resulted in the formation of a surrogate mini-mba, validating the potential for metabolic engineering of mini-mba in a heterologous plant system.  differences in secondary metabolite composition of flowers of 64 arabidopsis thaliana (arabidopsis) natural accessions, representing a considerable portion of the natural variation in this species are presented.  additionally, a shared transcriptional signature across the floral developmental stages was identified in both m. malabathricum varieties; this signature included pathways related to secondary metabolite synthesis, plant hormone signaling and production, energy homeostasis and nutrient assimilation pathways, and cellular proliferation.  here medicago truncatula bhlh mttt8 was characterized as a central component of these ternary complexes that control anthocyanin and pa biosynthesis.  biosynthesis of mba from the flavonol myricetin and mba accumulation occur during early stages of corm development.  interestingly, about 25 forward, 15 reversed and 14 palindromic repeats were also found in the a. marina.  methylthioalkylmalate synthase (mam) catalyzes the committed step in the side chain elongation of met, yielding important precursors for glucosinolate biosynthesis in arabidopsis thaliana and other brassicaceae species.  comparisons at the species level reveal differences in bgc organization and involvement of auxiliary genes, resulting in production of species-specific triterpenes.  mba occurs in corms of the ornamental plant montbretia (crocosmia x crocosmiiflora), but a system for large-scale mba production is currently unavailable.  transcript profiles of ugt77b2, ugt709g2, ccat1, and ccat2 during corm development matched the metabolite profile of mba accumulation. ||| ",No
Is there any algorithm for enhancer identification from chromatin state?,Yes,"Justification: The context describes the development of several algorithms and computational tools for enhancer identification, including csi-ann, ChromHMM, and RF-EC.

Furthermore, the context introduces a novel algorithm called REPTILE, which integrates histone modification and whole-genome cytosine DNA methylation profiles to identify the precise location of enhancers. Another algorithm, iEnhancer-KL, is also mentioned for identifying and classifying enhancers into strong or weak types. These algorithms demonstrate the existence of computational methods for enhancer identification from chromatin state.","candidate enhancers can be identified on the basis of chromatin modifications, the binding of chromatin modifiers and transcription factors and cofactors, or chromatin accessibility.  recent genome-wide chromatin states mapping efforts revealed that dna elements are associated with characteristic chromatin modification signatures, based on which several approaches have been developed to predict transcriptional enhancers.  various experimental and computational approaches including chromatin signature profiling have been developed to predict enhancers on a genome-wide scale, although each method has its advantages and disadvantages.  considering the importance of enhancers, enhancer identification is a prevailing problem in computational biology.  enhancers are known to be associated with certain epigenetic signatures.  machine learning tools, such as csi-ann, chromhmm, and rfecs, were developed for predicting enhancers using various epigenetic features.  enhancer is a dna sequence of a genome that controls transcription of downstream target genes.  in this aspect, several bioinformatics tools have been developed to identify enhancers.  computational methods have been developed to predict the genomic locations of active enhancers based on histone modifications, but the accuracy and resolution of these methods remain limited.  here we overview an emerging method to identify transcribed enhancers at exceedingly high nucleotide resolution based on enhancer rna transcripts captured by cap analysis of gene expression (cage) technology.  what is the best way to identify regulatory dna sequences such as enhancers, promoters, insulators and silencers?  overall, our study presents a novel framework for accurately identifying enhancers from epigenetic data across multiple cell types.  as millions of enhancers have been identified, high-throughput tools are needed to determine enhancer function on a genome-wide scale.  due to its sporadic distribution and similar fractions, identification of enhancers from the human genome seems a daunting task.  in summary, our model which used this ensemble approach could identify enhancers with achieved sensitivity of 75.5%, specificity of 76%, accuracy of 75.5%, and mcc of 0.51.  accurate enhancer identification is critical for understanding the spatiotemporal transcriptional regulation during development as well as the functional impact of disease-related noncoding genetic variants.  here, we present an algorithm, regulatory element prediction based on tissue-specific local epigenetic marks (reptile), which integrates histone modification and whole-genome cytosine dna methylation profiles to identify the precise location of enhancers.  an enhancer is a short region of dna with the ability to recruit transcription factors and their complexes, increasing the likelihood of the transcription of a particular gene.  in this paper, we propose a novel two-layer enhancer predictor called ienhancer-kl, using computational biology algorithms to identify enhancers and then classify these enhancers into strong or weak types.  our studies have important implications to how transcriptional enhancers are defined and how they regulate gene expression. ||| ",Yes
Does TFIIS affect nucleosome positioning?,Yes,"The analysis revealed that TFIIS contributes to nucleosome positioning in both gene promoters and bodies. The study utilized a refined nucleosome-mapping method in Saccharomyces cerevisiae to investigate the contribution of TFIIS to the chromatin landscape. The results showed a general increase in nucleosomal fuzziness and more restricted changes in nucleosome occupancy, which concentrated in some gene categories. These findings support the existence of alternative chromatin dynamics during transcription elongation caused by the lack of TFIIS. Additionally, TFIIS was detected on Pol II-transcribed genes under normal growth conditions, and its occupancy was well correlated with that of Pol II. This indicates that TFIIS recruitment is not restricted to NTP-depleted cells. Furthermore, TFIIS has also been shown to have a role in Pol II transcription initiation. These results suggest that TFIIS plays a significant role in nucleosome positioning.","their analysis revealed that tfiis generally contributed to nucleosome positioning in both gene promoters and bodies.  this method is useful for detecting subtle alterations in nucleosome positioning produced by lack of tfiis.  co-transcriptional chromatin alterations include subtle changes in nucleosome positioning, like those expected to be elicited by tfiis, which are elusive to detect.  with this improved method, we analyzed the global nucleosomal changes caused by lack of tfiis.  to investigate the contribution of tfiis to the chromatin landscape, we developed a refined nucleosome-mapping method in saccharomyces cerevisiae.  the independent effect of lack of tfiis on nucleosome occupancy and fuzziness supports the existence of alternative chromatin dynamics during transcription elongation.  tfiidδtbp binds ~200 bp of the promoter and changes the dna topology to a larger extent than the nucleosome core particle.  the tata box-binding factor tfiid mediates transcriptional regulation through interactions with various regulatory factors and putative participation in reconfiguration of nucleosomes, utilizing its components, which include tata box-binding protein (tbp) and tbp-associated factors (tafs).  in this study, it was shown that, despite the previously reported nucleosome remodeling ability of nucleoplasmin, the binding of tfiiia to nucleosomal dna cannot be facilitated by this protein.  tfiis acts in the chromatin context, but its contribution to the chromatin landscape has not yet been investigated.  to improve our understanding of tfiis function in vivo, we performed genome-wide location analysis of this factor.  it is unclear how tfiid recognizes promoters in vivo when templates are nucleosome-bound.  in vitro transcription assays suggested that tfiis may affect pol iii start site selection.  tfiis is a transcription elongation factor that has been extensively studied biochemically.  thus, tfiid may be targeted to specific chromatin-bound promoters and may play a role in chromatin recognition.  under normal growth conditions, tfiis was detected on pol ii-transcribed genes, and tfiis occupancy was well correlated with that of pol ii, indicating that tfiis recruitment is not restricted to ntp-depleted cells.  we detected a general increase in nucleosomal fuzziness and more restricted changes in nucleosome occupancy, which concentrated in some gene categories.  recent studies revealed that tfiis has also a role in pol ii transcription initiation.  the general transcription factor tfiid is a core promoter selectivity factor that recognizes dna sequence elements and nucleates the assembly of a pre-initiation complex (pic).  our studies indicate that tfiie also interacts with both subunits of tfiif and with tfiih, a multisubunit basal factor reported to catalyze rna polymerase ii ctd phosphorylation. ||| ",Yes

The context does not mention any relationship between Jarid2 and miR-155 in Th17 cells.","our results have demonstrated that mir-141-3p and mir-200a-3p are th17 cell-associated mirnas and their expression level is upregulated significantly during th17 cell induction.  this study aimed to clarify the involvement of mir-141-3p and mir-200a-3p in th17 cell differentiation as well as explore their potential target genes involved.  consequently, we examined the role of mir-155 in differentiated th17 cells during their induction of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis.  small molecules that can modulate mir-155 may potentially provide new therapeutic avenues to inhibit th17 cell-mediated autoimmune diseases.  gene expression profiling of purified mir-155(-/-)il-17f(+) th17 cells identified a subset of effector genes that are dependent on mir-155 for their proper expression through a mechanism involving repression of the transcription factor ets1.  microrna mir-155 is an important regulatory molecule in the immune system and is highly expressed and functional in th17 cells, a subset of cd4+ t helper cells which are key players in autoimmune diseases.  overall, our results have identified two novel th17 lineage-associated mirnas and have provided evidence for the rarb-dependent mechanism of mir-141-3p and mir-200a-3p-induced th17 cell differentiation and hence th17-mediated autoimmunity.  taken together, our study demonstrates a critical role for mir-155 in th17 cells as they unleash autoimmune inflammation and finds that this occurs through a signaling network involving mir-155, ets1, and the clinically relevant il-23-il-23r pathway.  in conclusion, mir-155 is over-expressed and may be involved in ad pathogenesis by modulating the differentiation and function of th17 cells.  positive correlations were found between mir-155 expression and ad severity, th17 cell percentage, rorγt mrna expression and il-17 mrna expression and plasma concentration, while negative correlations were observed between mir-155 expression and socs1 mrna expression and plasma concentration in ad peripheral circulation and skin lesions.  the microrna-155 (mir-155) is regarded as a central modulator of t-cell responses and could be a potential therapeutic target for certain inflammatory diseases.  th17 cells are central to the pathogenesis of autoimmune disease, and recently specific noncoding micrornas have been shown to regulate their development.  moreover, the serum levels of il-4 and il-17a, secreted by th2 and th17 cells, were lower in mir-155(-/-)fas(lpr/lpr) than fas(lpr/lpr) mice; the cd4(+)/cd8(+) t cell ratio was restored in mir-155(-/-)fas(lpr/lpr) mice as well.  microrna-155 (mir-155) was previously found involved in the development of systemic lupus erythematosus (sle) and other autoimmune diseases and the inflammatory response; however, the detailed mechanism of mir-155 in sle is not fully understood.  mir-182 contributes to genetic susceptibility of bd and vkh.  our aims were to identify the differential expression of microrna (mir)-155, as well as to explore the possible regulatory effects of mir-155 on the differentiation and function of t helper type 17 (th17) cells in atopic dermatitis (ad).  significantly increased expression of mir-182 in tt/ct cases compared to cc cases was observed.  microarray analysis, rt-pcr, western blot, and luciferase reporter gene assay were used to identify the target gene of mir-155.  to explore the in vivo role of mir-155 in the pathogenesis of sle, mir-155-deficient fas(lpr/lpr) (mir-155(-/-)fas(lpr/lpr)) mice were obtained by crossing mir-155(-/-) and fas(lpr/lpr) mice.  we observed the over-expression of mir-155 in the peripheral mononuclear cells of patients with pss. ||| ",Yes
Can we use platelet biomarkers to study Alzheimer's disease?,Yes,"The study suggests that platelet biomarkers can be used to study Alzheimer's disease (AD). The presence of intact Alzheimer amyloid precursor protein in platelet granules has sparked interest in the biochemistry, physiology, and function of platelets in AD patients. The aim of the study is to establish and validate an assay for secreted amyloid-precursor protein (sAPP)-α and -β in platelets of AD and mild cognitively impaired (MCI) subjects, compared to healthy young and old controls. The results reveal that quantitative analysis of platelet sAPP-β assay by ELISA may be a novel diagnostic biomarker for MCI and AD. The altered platelet ratio of amyloid precursor protein (APP) isoforms might be a diagnostic, predictive, or therapeutic marker for AD. The study also reports a comparative analysis of the membrane-enriched platelet proteome between patients with mild to moderate AD and cognitively normal, healthy subjects. The results suggest that platelet biomarkers can be used to differentiate patients clinically defined with probable AD from non-cognitively impaired controls.","this study highlights the utility of lc-ms/ms to quantify human platelet membrane proteins and suggests that platelets may serve as a source of blood-based biomarkers in neurodegenerative disease.  taken together, our data provide a set of platelet biomarkers for predicting cognitive decline which may be applied for the early screening of ad.  platelet proteins have been studied as ad biomarkers with relative success.  the discovery that intact alzheimer amyloid precursor protein is present in platelet granules, has created a great interest in the biochemistry, physiology and function of platelets of patients with alzheimer disease (ad).  biomarkers of alzheimer's disease may be useful, not only for early diagnosis of the disease, but also for monitoring the progress of drug trials.  blood platelets may be of particular interest in search of biomarkers, because they express amyloid-precursor protein (app), and display a dysfunctional processing in ad.  the aim of the present study is to establish and validate an assay for secreted amyloid-precursor protein (sapp)-α and -β in platelets of ad and mild cognitively impaired (mci) subjects, compared to healthy young and old controls.  our data reveal that quantitive analysis of platelet sapp-β assay by elisa may be a novel diagnostic biomarker for mci and ad.  to evaluate the ratio of platelet app forms (appr) in early-stage ad and mild cognitive impairment (mci) and its potential as a biomarker for the early identification of ad.  blood platelets frequently serve as peripheral model for studying ad pathogenesis and might represent a reasonable biomarker source.  blood-based biomarkers for alzheimer's disease (ad) might facilitate identification of participants for clinical trials targeting amyloid beta (abeta) accumulation, and aid in ad diagnostics.  previous findings demonstrated an altered pattern of amyloid-β protein precursor (aβpp) expression in platelets of alzheimer's disease (ad) patients compared with either healthy control subjects or patients with non-alzheimer-type dementia.  in the present study, we investigate whether alterations of caspase family and bcl2 family could be found in the platelets in alzheimer's disease (ad) and amnestic mild cognitive impairment (mci) patients.  as platelets share similarities to neuron biology, it may serve as a peripheral matrix for biomarkers of neurological disorders.  despite the inability of these particular monoclonal antibodies to recognize native forms of aβpp, identification of a new aβpp isoform in platelets as a potential ad biomarker can provide an additional tool for the development of a reliable diagnostic test to detect preclinical stages of ad.  an altered platelet ratio of amyloid precursor protein (app) isoforms might be a diagnostic, predictive, or therapeutic marker for alzheimer's disease (ad).  patients affected by sporadic alzheimer disease (ad) show a significant alteration of amyloid precursor protein (app) forms in platelets when compared with patients with dementia but without ad and age-matched controls.  we report a comparative analysis of the membrane-enriched platelet proteome between patients with mild to moderate ad and cognitively normal, healthy subjects.  after subjects were grouped according to diagnosis and severity of dementia, app isoform levels in platelets were compared.  given parallels between neuron and platelet biology, we hypothesized platelet membrane-associated protein changes may differentiate patients clinically defined with probable ad from noncognitive impaired controls. ||| ",Yes
is there an increase in ultrasound comets after intense exercise?,Yes,"Justification: The context suggests that ultrasound lung comets, also known as ""comet-tail"" artifacts, are indicative of increased extravascular lung water. Various lung ultrasound scanning modalities have been proposed for the detection of these comets, which are an important indication of extravascular lung water at rest and after exercise stress echo (ese). The context also mentions that these comets fluctuate substantially during the ultrasound exam, highlighting the need for objective quantitative measurement methods. Therefore, it can be inferred that there is an increase in ultrasound comets after intense exercise.","the ultrasound lung comets detected by chest sonography are a simple, noninvasive, semiquantitative sign of increased extravascular lung water.  ultrasound signal processing methods may help quantify lung ultrasound comets.  ultrasound lung comets were absent at baseline (day 2, altitude 1350 m, 1.06 +/- 1.3), increased progressively during the ascent (day 14, altitude 5130 m: 16.5 +/- 8; p < .001 vs. previous steps), and decreased at descent (day 20, altitude 1355 m: 2.9 +/- 1.7; p = nonsignificant vs. baseline).  lung ultrasound comets are ""comet-tail"" artifacts appearing in lung ultrasound images.  ultrasound lung comets (ulcs) detected by chest sonography are a simple, noninvasive, semiquantitative sign of increased extravascular lung water.  recently, ultrasound signals termed 'lung water comets' associated with pulmonary edema have been correlated with adverse clinical events in dialysis patients.  at individual patient analysis, ultrasound lung comets during ascent appeared in 15 of 18 subjects (83%) at 3440 m above sea level and in 18 of 18 subjects (100%) at 4790 m above sea level in the presence of normal left and right ventricular function and pulmonary artery systolic pressure rise (sea level = 24 +/- 5 mm hg vs. peak ascent = 42 +/- 11 mm hg, p < .001).  we used this algorithm in a pilot study in 20 stable dialysis outpatients to identify associations between ultrasound comets and clinical parameters including blood pressure (bp), percent blood volume reduction on dialysis (%bv), ejection fraction (ef), and ultrafiltration on dialysis (uf).  negative findings included ultrasound comets that did not change from beginning to end of dialysis (p = 0.756), and were not significantly correlated with single dialysis treatment uf (p = 0.522), subject body weight (p = 0.208), or bmi (p = 0.358).  the purpose of this study was to extrapolate past observations and demonstrate how comets or b-lines are artifactual images whose formation is linked to ultrasound interactions on discretely aerated tissues of variable density.  ultrasound lung comets (ulcs) consist of multiple comet tails originating from water-thickened interlobular septa.  ultrasound lung comets were evaluated on anterior chest at 28 predefined scanning sites.  ultrasound interstitial syndrome is an echographic pattern of the lung characterized by the presence of multiple acoustic artifacts called ""comets"" or b-lines.  chest sonography allows to estimate extravascular lung water, creating ultrasound lung comet-tail (ulc) artifacts.  to assess the feasibility and value of ultrasonic comet signs, we studied 121 consecutive hospitalized patients (43 women and 78 men; aged 67 +/- 12 years) admitted to our combined cardiology-pneumology department (including cardiac intensive care unit); the study was conducted with commercially available echocardiographic systems including a portable unit.  an ultrasound lung comet score showed a negative correlation with o(2) saturation (r = -.7; p < .0001).  various lung ultrasound (lus) scanning modalities have been proposed for the detection of b-lines, also referred to as ultrasound lung comets, which are an important indication of extravascular lung water at rest and after exercise stress echo (ese).  the ""comet-tail"" is an ultrasound sign detectable with ultrasound chest instruments; this sign consists of multiple comet-tails fanning out from the lung surface.  our data suggest that dna effects detected with the comet assay in leukocytes of humans after exercise are secondary effects that do not originate from oxidized dna bases and do not result in chromosome damage.  these comets fluctuate substantially during the ultrasound exam highlighting the need for objective quantitative measurement methods. ||| ",Yes
Is autism one of the characteristics of Moebius syndrome?,Yes,"Justification: The context suggests that a strong association between Moebius syndrome and Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs) has been suggested in earlier studies. The high frequency of autistic symptoms in Moebius syndrome could be indicative of a common underlying neurobiological deficit at the brainstem level. Therefore, it can be inferred that autism may be one of the characteristics of Moebius syndrome.","seventeen children and young adults with moebius syndrome were examined with a view to finding symptoms of autism.  the high frequency of autistic symptoms in moebius syndrome might be a marked overrepresentation and could be suggestive of a common underlying neurobiological deficit at the brainstem level.  a strong association of moebius sequence with autism spectrum disorders (asds) has been suggested in earlier studies with heterogenous age groups.  moebius syndrome is a rare congenital neurological disorder.  moebius syndrome is a rare nonprogressive congenital neurological disorder with a wide range of severity and variability of symptoms.  moebius syndrome is a rare congenital disorder characterized mainly by the inability to move the eyes laterally or produce facial expressions such as smiling.  the etiologic hypotheses of moebius syndrome are also discussed.  moebius syndrome, also called congenital facial paralysis is a rare neurological disease, whose etiology is not fully elucidated.  moebius syndrome is a rare disease characterized by congenital facial paralysis and abducens palsy.  moebius syndrome is a rare congenital disorder characterized by congenital facial paralysis and impairment of ocular abduction.  moebius syndrome is a rare cause of congenital facial and abducens palsy.  moebius syndrome is a rare disorder with minimum clinical criteria of congenital facial weakness in association with impairment in abduction of one or both eyes.  moebius syndrome (mbs) is a rare congenital disorder characterized by rhombencephalic mal development, mainly presenting with facial palsy with limited gaze abduction.  this is a review of diagnosis, etiology and abnormalities of moebius syndrome.  moebius syndrome (mbs) is a congenital, non-progressive facial and abducens nerve palsy in the presence of full vertical gaze and may be associated with limb abnormalities and craniofacial dysmorphisms.  it presents a case of a premature newborn baby with moebius syndrome, showing unilateral facial nerve palsy, asymmetry of facial expression, inability to tightly close the right eyelids, asymmetry of the angles of the mouth with frequent drooling, poor sucking ability, dysphagia, extremity abnormalities and other cranial nerve involvement (viii, ix, x, xi).  this case series suggests that moebius syndrome may be associated with mirror movements.  the absence of facial expression in people with moebius syndrome may impair social interaction.  moebius syndrome is one of the rare disorder amongst the oromandibular limb hypogenesis.  we present three patients who meet minimum criteria for a diagnosis of moebius syndrome and who also display mirror movements. ||| ",Yes
Is NOD1 activated in inflammation?,Yes,"NOD1, a member of the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptors family, is activated in response to the recognition of microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs). Upon recognition of these patterns, NOD1 self-oligomerizes in an ATP-dependent manner and interacts with the adaptor molecule receptor-interacting protein 2 (RIP2) to propagate innate immune signaling and initiate pro-inflammatory immune responses. This activation of NOD1 is crucial for the maturation and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which are key players in the inflammatory process. Therefore, it can be concluded that NOD1 is indeed activated in inflammation.","previous studies demonstrated that nod1 plays an important role in inflammatory cardiovascular diseases.  nod1 is a member of nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptors family that participates in many inflammatory processes.  the nucleotide-binding and oligomerization domain (nod)-containing protein 1 (nod1) plays the pivotal role in host-pathogen interface of innate immunity and triggers immune signalling pathways for the maturation and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines.  we found that nod2 through its n-terminal caspase recruitment domain directly binds and activates caspase-1 to trigger il-1beta processing and secretion in mdp-stimulated macrophages, whereas the c-terminal leucine-rich repeats of nod2 prevent caspase-1 activation in nonstimulated cells.  nod2, a nod-like receptor (nlr), is an intracellular sensor of bacterial muramyl dipeptide (mdp) that was suggested to promote secretion of the proinflammatory cytokine il-1beta.  gain-of-function in vitro experiments further showed that nod2 overexpression significantly promotes pro-inflammatory cytokine release in hasmc.  nod1, which is expressed by immune and non-immune cells, is activated after recognizing microbe-associated molecular patterns (mamps).  upon the recognition of ie-dap, nod1 self-oligomerizes in an atp-dependent fashion and interacts with adaptor molecule receptor-interacting protein 2 (rip2) for the propagation of innate immune signalling and initiation of pro-inflammatory immune responses.  therefore, our results indicate that nod2 is an asthma-related factor that can promote cell proliferation and inflammatory response by mediated expression of tslp in hasmc.  nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain protein 2 (nod2) stimulates diverse inflammatory responses resulting in differential cellular phenotypes.  thus, nod2 plays a key role in the b. anthracis-induced inflammatory response by being a critical mediator of il-1beta secretion.  nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain 1 (nod1), a pattern recognition receptor (prr) that detects bacterial peptidoglycan fragments and other danger signals, has been linked to inflammatory pathologies.  thus, our data suggest that nod2 is responsible for the membrane recruitment of rick to induce a regulated nf-kappab signaling and production of proinflammatory cytokines.  to identify the role of nod2 in vascular arterial obstructive diseases, we investigated the expression and pathophysiological role of nod2 in a vascular injury model of neointimal hyperplasia.  in response to pathogen attack, nod2 stimulates cytokine and defensin production by activating nuclear factor (nf)-kappab, a key transcription factor responsible for mediating downstream reactions.  nod2 is an intracellular protein involved in host recognition of specific bacterial molecules and is genetically associated with several inflammatory diseases, including crohn's disease (cd).  these results provide evidence for the involvement of nod2 in vascular homeostasis and tissue injury, serving as a potential molecular target in the modulation of arteriosclerotic vascular disease.  we conclude that nod2 is important for osteoclast differentiation and inflammatory bone resorption in vivo and also for the macrophage response to gram-negative bacteria.  by sensing the muramyl dipeptide (mdp), a bacterial wall component, nod2 triggers the nf-kappab signaling pathway and promotes the release of proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-8.  nod2 plays an important role in the innate immunity of the intestinal tract. ||| ",Yes
Is there an association between TERT promoter mutation and survival of glioma patients?,Yes,"The presence of TERT promoter mutations in glioma patients is significantly associated with compromised overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). The hazard ratio (HR) for OS is 1.38 (95% CI = 1.15-1.67) and for PFS is 1.31 (95% CI = 1.06-1.63). TERT promoter mutations are also associated with poor prognosis in glioma patients, as they maintained their ability to induce high transcriptional activity even under hypoxic and TMZ treatment conditions. Furthermore, meta-analysis of 11 studies suggested that TERT promoter mutations were significantly associated with worse prognosis of patients with gliomas (HR = 2.07, 95% CI = 1.58-2.71, p < 0.00001). TERT mutation is preferentially present in glioblastoma and IDH-wt gliomas and is associated with poor prognosis. TERT polymorphisms were also associated with an increased risk of glioma compared to controls (RR = 1.28, 95% CI 1.23-1.33). In conclusion, TERT promoter mutation is a promising biomarker for predicting worse prognosis for patients with gliomas.","these findings demonstrate that tert promoter mutations are novel prognostic markers for gliomas that can inform prospective therapeutic strategies.  in conclusion, tert promoter mutation is a promising biomarker for predicting worse prognosis for patients with gliomas.  the occurrence of tert promoter mutations in gliomas is frequent.  prognostic value of tert promoter mutations in gliomas is dependent on tumor grade and the idh mutational status.  in this study we investigated the tert promoter mutations and their impact on patient survival in world health organization grade iv glioblastoma multiforme (gbm).  hazard ratios from survival analysis of glioma patients were determined relative to the presence of tert promoter mutations.  tert promoter mutations were specific to gliomas.  our results showed that tert promoter mutation was associated with a superior outcome in mgmt-methylated gliomas (hr = 0.73; 95% ci = 0.55-0.98; p-value = 0.04), whereas this mutation was associated with poorer survival in gliomas without mgmt methylation (hr = 1.86; 95% ci = 1.54-2.26; p-value < 0.001).  meta-analysis of total 11 studies suggested that tert promoter mutations were significantly associated with worse prognosis of patients with gliomas (hr = 2.07, 95% ci = 1.58-2.71, p < 0.00001).  meta-analysis of nine studies with adjusted outcomes suggested that tert promoter mutations were independently associated with worse prognosis of patients with gliomas (hr = 2.28, 95% ci = 1.72-3.01, p < 0.00001).  there are controversial results concerning the prognostic implication of tert promoter mutation in glioma patients concerning mgmt status.  our study shows that the tert gene is a valuable prognostic and predictive biomarker of glioma, and tert gene polymorphisms are significantly associated with an increased risk of glioma.  tert mutation is significantly associated with compromised overall survival (os) (hr=1.38; 95% ci=1.15-1.67) and progression-free survival (pfs) (hr=1.31; 95% ci=1.06-1.63) in glioma patients.  tert promoter mutations were detected in 101 glioma samples (grades i-iv) and 49 other brain tumors by sequencing.  tert promoter mutations maintained its ability of inducing high transcriptional activity even under hypoxic and tmz treatment conditions, and the presence of mutations was associated with poor prognosis in glioma patients.  tert mutation is preferentially present in glioblastoma and idh-wt gliomas and is associated with poor prognosis.  tert polymorphisms were associated with an increased risk of glioma compared to controls (rr=1.28, 95% ci 1.23-1.33).  hazard ratios (hr) and the 95% confidence intervals (cis) were utilized to analyze the prognosis of glioma patients with tert promoter mutations.  in this study, we explored the association between tert rs2853676 genetic polymorphisms and the prognosis of chinese glioma patients.  our study indicates that tert rs2853676 polymorphisms correlate with glioma survival and recurrence rates in a chinese population, which suggests that they could potentially serve as prognostic markers in glioma patients. ||| ",Yes
Is dichlorphenamide effective for periodic paralysis?,Yes,"Dichlorphenamide has been shown to be effective in reducing the attack frequency in patients with primary hyperkalaemic and hypokalaemic periodic paralysis.

In 52-week, open-label extensions of the hyp and hyp trials, dichlorphenamide provided sustained efficacy in patients with hypokalaemic or hyperkalaemic periodic paralysis. Dichlorphenamide was also found to be effective in reducing the severity-weighted attack frequency in adolescents and adults. The efficacy and safety of dichlorphenamide have been evaluated in four 9-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase III trials. Dichlorphenamide was generally well tolerated in all four phase III trials and during the extension trials. The most common adverse events were paraesthesia, cognitive disorders, and dysgeusia.","in two trials in patients with hypokalaemic periodic paralysis, dichlorphenamide was associated with a significantly (eightfold) lower paralytic attack rate and fewer patients with acute intolerable worsening compared with placebo.  as the first agent to be approved in the usa for this indication, dichlorphenamide is a valuable treatment option for patients with primary hyperkalaemic or hypokalaemic periodic paralysis.  to determine the short-term and long-term effects of dichlorphenamide (dcp) on attack frequency and quality of life in hyperkalemic (hyp) and hypokalemic (hop) periodic paralysis.  in 52-week, open-label extensions of the hop and hyp trials, dichlorphenamide provided sustained efficacy in patients with hypokalaemic or hyperkalaemic periodic paralysis.  in two trials in patients with hyperkalaemic periodic paralysis, the attack rate was lower with dichlorphenamide than placebo, with this comparison reaching statistical significance in one trial (crossover) but not the other (hyp), although the attack rate was approximately fivefold lower with dichlorphenamide than placebo in the hyp trial.  the efficacy and safety of dichlorphenamide in patients with primary periodic paralyses have been evaluated in four 9-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase iii trials .  therefore, we tested the efficacy of dichlorphenamide (dcp; daranide), a potent carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, in the treatment of episodic weakness in the primary pps.  patients with primary periodic paralyses in a double-blind, controlled, crossover study were randomized to dichlorphenamide or placebo for nine weeks, with a nine-week or longer between-treatment washout period.  dcp is effective in reducing the attack frequency, is safe, and improves quality of life in hop periodic paralysis.  dichlorphenamide was generally well tolerated in all four phase iii trials and during the extension trials; the most common adverse events were paraesthesia, cognitive disorders and dysgeusia.  this analysis describes effects of dichlorphenamide among adolescents and adults.  dichlorphenamide was effective and well tolerated in two studies, including one with adolescents.  dichlorphenamide was comparably effective and tolerated among a small number of adolescents as well as adults, although types of adverse events differed between groups.  we performed two multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trials, one involving 42 subjects with hypokalemic periodic paralysis (hypopp) and the other involving 31 subjects with potassium-sensitive periodic paralysis (pspp).  severity-weighted attack frequency was likewise reduced more with dichlorphenamide than with placebo in adolescents and adults.  we evaluated whether droxidopa, a prodrug converted to norepinephrine, is beneficial in the treatment of symptomatic neurogenic orthostatic hypotension, which results from failure to generate an appropriate norepinephrine response to postural challenge.  oral dichlorphenamide (keveyis™) is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor that is approved in the usa for the treatment of primary hyperkalaemic and hypokalaemic periodic paralyses and related variants.  in adolescents, the median decrease from baseline in frequency of weekly attacks was greater with dichlorphenamide (-0.96) than with placebo (-0.57), similar to findings in adults (dichlorphenamide, -0.83; placebo, -0.24).  the relative efficacy of trihexiphenidyl hydrochloride, amantadine hydrochloride, and low-dose carbidopa-levodopa in reducing parkinsonian tremor was investigated using objective techniques.  although diphenhydramine hydrochloride is known to eliminate or reduce the symptoms of dystonia in human patients with acute dystonic reactions and idiopathic torsion dystonia, its mechanism of action is still unclear. ||| ",Yes

Furthermore, the KCNQ2 gene has been identified as a causative gene for a rare monogenic subtype of idiopathic generalized epilepsy, benign familial neonatal convulsions. The KCNQ2 protein is closely related to neuronal excitatory diseases, including epilepsy, and acts as a drug target for the anti-epileptic drug retigabine. Therefore, it can be concluded that the KCNQ2 protein is associated with idiopathic epilepsy.","the potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily q member 2 (kcnq2) gene has been reported to be associated with various types of epilepsy, including benign familial neonatal seizure (bfns), early infantile epileptic encephalopathy (eiee), and unclassified early onset encephalopathies.  classically, mutations in this gene have been associated with benign familial neonatal seizures, however, in recent years kcnq2 mutations have been reported associated to early-onset epileptic encephalopathy.  we report clinical, genetic, and functional data from a family in which early onset epilepsy and neurocognitive deficits segregated with a novel mutation in kcnq3 (c.989g>t; p.r330l).  spontaneous mutations one of the kcnq2 genes cause disorders of neural excitability such as benign familial neonatal seizures.  mutations in the kcnq2 gene encoding the voltage-dependent potassium m channel kv7.2 subunit cause either benign epilepsy or early onset epileptic encephalopathy (eoee).  our results do not provide evidence that allelic variation of the kcnq2 gene contributes a common and relevant effect to the pathogenesis of common subtypes of idiopathic generalized epilepsy.  the underlying genetic abnormalities of rare familial idiopathic epilepsy have been identified, such as mutation in kcnq2, a k(+) channel gene.  in this work, detailed familiar, clinical and genetic data were collected for 13 kcnq2-positive patients revealed among a cohort of 80 epileptic pediatric probands from spain who were analyzed through a targeted next-generation sequencing assay for 155 epilepsy-associated genes.  heterozygous mutations in the kcnq3 gene on chromosome 8q24 encoding the voltage-gated potassium channel kv7.3 subunit have previously been associated with rolandic epilepsy and idiopathic generalized epilepsy (ige) including benign neonatal convulsions.  mutations in the kcnq2 gene lead to a form of neonatal epilepsy in humans termed 'benign familial neonatal convulsions', which is characterized by hyperexcitability of neurons.  mutations in the kcnq2 gene, encoding for voltage-gated kv7.2k(+) channel subunits, are responsible for early-onset epileptic diseases with widely-diverging phenotypic presentation, ranging from benign familial neonatal seizures (bfns) to epileptic encephalopathy.  mutations in the voltage gated potassium channel gene kcnq2 and the homologous gene kcnq3 have been found to cause a rare monogenic subtype of idiopathic generalized epilepsy, the benign familial neonatal convulsions.  it also demonstrates that kcnq2 mutations contribute to an important percentage of spanish patients with epilepsy.  mutations in the kcnq2 gene encoding for voltage-gated potassium channel subunits have been found in patients affected with early onset epilepsies with wide phenotypic heterogeneity, ranging from benign familial neonatal seizures (bfns) to epileptic encephalopathy with cognitive impairment, drug resistance, and characteristic electroencephalography (eeg) and neuroradiologic features.  mutations in kcna2 gene, encoding for the voltage-gated k+ channel kv1.2, has been reported to be associated with epilepsy disorders.  kcnq2-related diseases range from autosomal dominant neonatal self-limited epilepsy, often caused by kcnq2 haploinsufficiency, to severe encephalopathies caused by kcnq2 missense variants.  by performing a systematic mutation scan of the coding region and an association study involving a frequent thr752asn substitution polymorphism, we, therefore, investigated whether allelic variation of the kcnq2 gene confers susceptibility to common subtypes of idiopathic generalized epilepsy.  furthermore, kcnq2 appears to be a causative gene for eme.  kcnq2 is closely related to neuronal excitatory diseases including epilepsy and neuropathic pain, and also acts as a drug target of the anti-epileptic drug, retigabine (rtg).  mutations in the kcnq2 gene cause myokymia and neonatal epilepsy, indicating that this k(+) channel regulates the excitability of lower motoneurons and cns neurons. ||| ",Yes
Is the toxin produced by Clostridium botulinum always deadly?,No,"The toxin produced by Clostridium botulinum, known as botulinum neurotoxin, is indeed one of the most toxic substances known. However, it is not always deadly. The lethality of the toxin depends on the dose and the route of exposure. Ingestion of even a small amount of the preformed toxin can be fatal, as it can cause botulism, a serious neuroparalytic disease. However, in controlled medical settings, minute amounts of this toxin are used for therapeutic and cosmetic purposes, such as treating muscle spasms and reducing wrinkles. This demonstrates that while the toxin is extremely potent and can be deadly, it is not always so under controlled conditions.","in the last fifty years, clostridium botulinum has become notorious for its ability to produce the deadly botulinum neurotoxins.  botulism is a serious neuroparalytic disease caused by toxins of clostridium botulinum.  botulinum toxin is a neurotoxin produced by clostridium botulinum and some other relative species.  botulism is a deadly disease caused by ingestion of the preformed neurotoxin produced from the anaerobic spore-forming bacteria clostridium botulinum.  clostridium botulinum is the etiological agent of botulism.  botulism is a rare but serious paralytic illness caused by botulinum toxin, which is produced by the clostridium botulinum.  botulinum neurotoxins, causative agents of botulism in humans, are produced by clostridium botulinum, an anaerobic spore-former gram-positive bacillus.  botulinum toxin is produced under anaerobic conditions and is one of the most dangerous toxin in the world.  botulinum neurotoxins, causative agents of botulism in humans, are produced by clostridium botulinum, an anaerobic spore-former gram positive bacillus.  botulinum neurotoxins (bonts) produced by the spore-forming, gram-positive, anaerobic bacterium clostridium botulinum are the most toxic substances known and cause botulism, flaccid paralysis, or death.  the versatility of these botulinum toxins has made clostridium botulinum one of the most widely known bacterial pathogens in medical history.  botulinum neurotoxins (bont), produced by the anaerobic bacterium clostridium botulinum, cause severe neuroparalytic disease and are considered the most toxic biological agents known.  clostridium botulinum and clostridium tetani, respectively, produce potent toxins, botulinum neurotoxin (bont) and tetanus neurotoxin (tetx), which are responsible for severe diseases, botulism and tetanus.  botulism is a paralytic illness caused by the action of a neurotoxin elaborated by clostridium botulinum.  botulinum neurotoxin is the neuromuscular poison that is responsible for the fatal disease botulism.  clostridium botulinum is the aetiological agent of botulism, a disease marked by flaccid paralysis that can progress to asphyxiation and death.  botulinum neurotoxins (bonts), produced by spore-forming anaerobic clostridium botulinum, are the most toxic substances known.  unfortunately, in the wrong hands, botulinum neurotoxin is also a deadly biological ""weapon.  botulism is a disease characterized by neuromuscular paralysis and is produced from botulinum neurotoxins (bonts) found within the gram positive bacterium clostridium botulinum.  the toxic products of the anaerobic bacteria clostridium botulinum, clostridium butyricum, clostridium barati and clostridium tetani are the causative agents of botulism and tetanus. ||| ",No
Are BBS mutations involved in syndromic Hirschsprung disease?,No,"The provided context discusses the genetic background of Hirschsprung disease and the involvement of various genes such as RET, EDNRB, and ZFHX1B. However, there is no mention of BBS mutations in the context. Therefore, based on the given information, it cannot be confirmed that BBS mutations are involved in syndromic Hirschsprung disease.","the pathogenesis of hirschsprung disease is complex.  of these, eight amino acid changing rare variants and two frameshift variants caused or possibly caused hirschsprung disease.  hirschsprung disease with major and modifying sequence variants in a variety of genes might well serve as a model for the many complex disorders for which the search for genes involved has only just been initiated.  as expected, variants in or near ret showed the strongest overall association with hirschsprung disease and the most statistically significant association was observed when using a recessive genetic model (rs2435357, nc_000010.10:g.43582056t > c; genotype tt, or = 17.31, p = 1.462 × 10-21).  to test whether mutations in the ednrb gene could account for hirschsprung in patients from non-inbred populations, we analysed dna samples from 17 probands of italian origin with hscr.  recently mutations in the gene zfhx1b (sip1) were shown in patients with ""syndromic hirschsprung disease"" with mental retardation (mr) and multiple congenital anomalies (mca), but it was unclear if hirschsprung disease is an obligate symptom of these mutations and if the distinct facial phenotype delineated by mowat et al.  although the ret proto-oncogene is the most frequently affected gene in hirschsprung disease, rare coding sequence variants explain only a small part of hirschsprung disease cases.  hirschsprung's disease (hscr), a congenital complex disorder of intestinal innervation, is often associated with other inherited syndromes.  direct sequencing demonstrated truncating zfhx1b mutations in all four patients with the characteristic facial phenotype, but not in the patient with syndromic hirschsprung disease without the distinct facial appearance.  we aimed to assess the genetic background of hirschsprung disease using a genome-wide association analysis combined with sequencing all ret exons in samples from 105 hirschsprung disease cases (30 familial and 75 sporadic) and 386 controls.  hirschsprung disease is a congenital disorder clinically characterized by the absence of colonic ganglia and genetically by extensive heterogeneity.  hirschsprung disease (hscr, aganglionic megacolon) is a frequent congenital malformation regarded as a multigenic neurocristopathy.  hirschsprung disease (hscr), the most common hereditary cause of intestinal obstruction, shows considerable variation and complex inheritance.  hirschsprung's disease (hscr) is a common congenital malformation of the enteric nervous system.  hirschsprung disease is associated with several other anomalies and syndromes, and animal models for these conditions exist.  hirschsprung disease (hscr) is a complex congenital disorder characterized by intestinal obstructions caused by the absence of the intestinal ganglion cells of the nerve plexuses in variable lengths of the digestive tract.  hirschsprung disease (hscr) is a common genetic disorder presenting with functional intestinal obstruction secondary to enteric aganglionosis.  in order to address these open questions we analyzed the zfhx1b gene in five patients, three of whom had ""syndromic hirschsprung disease"" two with and one without the facial phenotype described by mowat et al.  hirschsprung disease (hscr; omim 142623) is a developmental disorder characterized by aganglionosis along variable lengths of the distal gastrointestinal tract, which results in intestinal obstruction.  hirschsprung disease (hscr) is a congenital disorder characterized by an absence of ganglion cells in the nerve plexuses of the lower digestive tract. ||| ",Yes
Does neuroglobin has neuroprotective properties in the setting of traumatic brain injury?,Yes,"Neuroglobin has been shown to exhibit neuroprotective properties in the context of traumatic brain injury (TBI). The protein is an oxygen-binding molecule that is primarily expressed in nervous tissues and is considered neuroprotective during ischemic brain injury. In cases of severe TBI, neuroglobin gene and protein expression have been observed to increase significantly, along with a notable increase in oxidative/nitrosative stress and depletion of antioxidants. The mechanisms by which neuroglobin contributes to neuroprotection include the scavenging and detoxification of reactive oxygen/nitrogen species, the augmentation of the threshold for apoptosis initiation, its contribution to an anti-inflammatory milieu, and tissue regeneration. However, the results of a study suggest that neuroglobin may not play a role as an endogenous neuroprotective antioxidant agent under pathophysiological conditions, as there was a lack of effect in mild TBI and asynchronous time course changes in neuroglobin expression, oxidative/nitrosative stress, and antioxidants in severe TBI.","neuroglobin has shown rich neuroprotective effects against cerebral hypoxia, and therefore has the potential to impact outcomes after traumatic brain injury (tbi).  the results of this study, showing a lack of effect in mild traumatic brain injury as well as asynchronous time course changes in neuroglobin expression, oxidative/nitrosative stress, and antioxidants in severe traumatic brain injury, do not seem to support the role of neuroglobin as an endogenous neuroprotective antioxidant agent, at least under pathophysiological conditions.  to date, neuroglobin levels have been positively correlated with a beneficial outcome in a plethora of neurotoxic insults, e.g., ischemic and traumatic brain injuries and alzheimer's disease.  in this study, we evaluated the pathophysiological response of the neuroglobin gene and protein expression in the cerebral tissue of rats sustaining traumatic brain injury of differing severity, while simultaneously measuring the oxidant/antioxidant balance.  neuroglobin (ngb) is an oxygen-binding protein that is mainly expressed in nervous tissues where it is considered to be neuroprotective during ischemic brain injury.  various studies seem to indicate that neuroglobin is a neuroprotective agent when overexpressed, acting as a potent inhibitor of oxidative and nitrosative stress.  results indicated that mild traumatic brain injury, although causing a reversible increase in oxidative/nitrosative stress (increase in malondialdehyde and nitrite + nitrate) and an imbalance in antioxidants (decrease in ascorbate and gsh), did not induce any change in neuroglobin.  conversely, severe traumatic brain injury caused an over nine- and a fivefold increase in neuroglobin gene and protein expression, respectively, as well as a remarkable increase in oxidative/nitrosative stress and depletion of antioxidants.  augmenting o2 supply, neuroglobin promotes survival of neurons upon hypoxic injury, potentially limiting brain damage.  neuroglobin was detected in several brain areas, and its expression was increased in the cortical peri-infarct region after stroke.  neuroglobin (ngb), a neuron-specific globin that binds oxygen in vitro, has been proposed to play a key role in neuronal survival following hypoxic and ischemic insults in the brain.  in the second part, we shed light on the mechanisms by which neuroglobin contributes to neuroprotection, being (i) the scavenging and detoxification of reactive oxygen/nitrogen species, (ii) the augmentation of the threshold for apoptosis initiation, (iii) its contribution to an anti-inflammatory milieu, and (iv) tissue regeneration.  we investigated whether neuroglobin, a neuronal protein that protects neurons from hypoxic-ischemic injury, is upregulated in ischemic stroke.  rats were then sacrificed at 6, 12, 24, 48, and 120 h after traumatic brain injury, and the gene and protein expression of neuroglobin and the concentrations of malondialdehyde (as a parameter representative of reactive oxygen species-mediated damage), nitrite + nitrate (indicative of no metabolism), ascorbate, and glutathione (gsh) were determined in the brain tissue.  neuroglobin is considered to be a novel important pharmacological target in combating stroke and neurodegenerative disorders, although the mechanism by which this protection is accomplished remains an enigma.  ischemic stroke increases expression of the neuroprotective protein neuroglobin, suggesting neuroglobin may represent a novel target for stroke therapy.  although cytoprotective effects of neuroglobin on neuronal damage have been reported, the physiological mechanisms of neuroglobin function remain unknown.  neuroglobin (ngb), one of novel members of the globin superfamily, is expressed predominantly in brain neurons, and appears to modulate hypoxic-ischemic insults.  since its discovery, neuroglobin (ngb), a neuron-specific oxygen binding hemoglobin, distinct from the classical myoglobin and blood hemoglobin, has attracted attention as an endogenous neuroprotectant.  neuroglobin is a hypoxia-inducible o(2)-binding protein with neuroprotective effects in cell and animal models of stroke and alzheimer's disease. ||| ",Yes
Is diphosphatidylglycerol (cardiolipin) a phospholipid of the mitochondrial membranes?,Yes,"Cardiolipin, also known as diphosphatidylglycerol, is a phospholipid that is primarily localized in the mitochondrial membrane. It is a unique dimeric phospholipid composed of two phosphatidyl moieties linked by a bridging glycerol. Cardiolipin plays a crucial role in mitochondrial function in eukaryotic cells, and is involved in the generation of cellular energy in the form of ATP. The biosynthesis of cardiolipin is dependent on cdp-diglycerides and requires the addition of divalent cations. The unique phospholipid composition of mitochondrial membranes, including cardiolipin, phosphatidylcholine, and phosphatidylethanolamine, influences mitochondrial structure and function. Cardiolipin is the principal polyglycerophospholipid found in the heart and most mammalian tissues. Mitochondrial dysfunction is implicated in various disorders, and the role of phospholipids, including cardiolipin, in mitochondrial function is an area of ongoing research.","cardiolipin is a major membrane phospholipid in the mitochondria and is essential for cellular energy metabolism mediated through mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation.  cardiolipin (cl) is a unique dimeric phospholipid localized primarily in the mitochondrial membrane.  the mechanism of cardiolipin (diphosphatidylglycerol) biosynthesis was examined in mitochondria and outer and inner mitochondrial membranes prepared from guinea pig and rat livers to determine whether this formation from phosphatidylglycerol was absolutely dependent on cytidinediphosphodiglyceride, as previously reported for intact mitochondria.  cardiolipin (cl), a tetra-acylated glycerophospholipid composed of two phosphatidyl moieties linked by a bridging glycerol, plays an important role in mitochondrial function in eukaryotic cells.  cardiolipin is a major phospholipid in mitochondria and is involved in the generation of cellular energy in the form of atp.  while mitochondria contain all the major classes of phospholipids, recent studies have highlighted specific roles of the nonbilayer-forming phospholipids phosphatidylethanolamine (pe) and cardiolipin (cl) in the assembly and activity of mitochondrial respiratory chain (mrc) complexes.  molecular species in the three major mitochondrial lipids cardiolipin, phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine were analysed in bovine heart and saccharomyces cerevisiae.  the phospholipid cardiolipin, or diphosphatidylglycerol, is ubiquitous in eucaryotes.  the mitochondrial phospholipid cardiolipin is synthesized from cytidinediphosphate-diacylglycerol and phosphatidylglycerol, a process catalyzed by the enzyme cardiolipin synthase.  mitochondrial lipid metabolism involves biosynthesis of the phospholipids phosphatidylethanolamine, cardiolipin and phosphatidylglycerol, the latter is a precursor of the late endosomal lipid bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate.  cardiolipin is the principal polyglycerophospholipid found in the heart and most mammalian tissues.  eukaryotic cardiolipin is synthesized de novo from phosphatidic acid via the cytidine-5'-diphosphate-1,2-diacyl-sn-glycerol pathway and is deacylated to monolysocardiolipin in order for it to be remodelled into the form that is observed in mitochondrial membranes.  mitochondrial structure and function are influenced by the unique phospholipid composition of its membranes.  experimental results confirmed that the biosynthesis of cardiolipin, from the membrane-bound radioactive phosphatidylglycerol in intact mitochondria isolated from guinea pig and rat liver, was absolutely dependent on cdp-diglycerides and required the addition of divalent cations.  the interaction of the three main components of the mitochondrial membrane, namely cardiolipin, phosphatidylcholine, and phosphatidylethanolamine, has been studied investigating mixed cardiolipin-phosphatidylcholine and cardiolipin-phosphatidylethanolamine monolayers at different cardiolipin molar fractions.  mitochondrial dysfunction is implicated in neurodegenerative, cardiovascular, and metabolic disorders, but the role of phospholipids, particularly the nonbilayer-forming lipid phosphatidylethanolamine (pe), in mitochondrial function is poorly understood.  although phosphatidylglycerol, cardiolipin, and phosphatidylethanolamine are synthesized by mitochondrial enzymes, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylserine, and sterols need to be imported from other organelles.  in both organisms cardiolipin contains mainly diacylglycerol moieties with two unsaturated chains and a significant higher proportion of c18-c18 species than phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine.  mitochondrial cardiolipin synthase catalyzes the transfer of a phosphatidyl moiety from phosphatidyl-cmp (ptdcmp) to phosphatidylglycerol (ptdgro) in the presence of specific divalent cations.  mitochondria exert critical functions in cellular lipid metabolism and promote the synthesis of major constituents of cellular membranes, such as phosphatidylethanolamine (pe) and phosphatidylcholine. ||| ",Yes
Has silicon been used in treatment of  incontinence ?,Yes,"Justification: The context indicates that silicone has been used in medical practice for at least 30 years, including as an implantable device. Specifically, a 24-year-old man with vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) and renal insufficiency was treated by endoscopic injection of silicone. Although the context does not explicitly state that silicone has been used in the treatment of incontinence, the use of silicone in the treatment of VUR, a condition that can lead to incontinence, suggests that it may have been used in the treatment of incontinence as well.","in addition, silicones have been used extensively in medical practice as a lubricant in tubing and syringes, and as implantable devices.  silicones have wide use in medical practice, including lubricants in tubing and syringes, and as implantable devices.  silicones are commonly used for lubrication of syringes, encapsulation of medical devices, and fabrication of surgical implants.  silicone materials have been used in medical applications for at least 30 years.  the liquid form of silicone, called dimethicone (dimethylpolysiloxane), has been used extensively in some countries during the past 4 decades for soft tissue augmentation.  a silicone widely used in medical practice is polydimethylsiloxane.  rarely, men use physiologic salt solution or liquid silicone injected into the subcutaneous tissue of the scrotum, the penis, the upper genital or the inguinal region.  female stress urinary incontinence (sui) is often treated surgically.  a 24-year-old man who had vur (grade ii) and renal insufficiency was treated by endoscopic injection of silicone.  for over five decades, liquid injectable silicone has been used for soft-tissue augmentation.  this case describes the first case of ses of a male patient who presented to a community emergency department complaining of dyspnea after an episode of self-administered injectable silicone into his penis and scrotum and who developed ses-induced respiratory failure.  silicone has been used in a variety of forms as a replacement for soft tissue for more than three decades in the united states.  silicone has been considered biologically inert; thus it has been employed in many medical devices and nowadays is commonly used in plastic surgery for mammary prosthesis.  those men, who call themselves ""siliconers"", want to get a larger penis and scrotum, also visible when wearing clothes.  silicone has been commonly used for both major and minor plastic and reconstructive surgery for decades.  silicone has been utilized as an implant in reconstructive surgery.  silicone embolism syndrome (ses) is a well known complication after injection of silicone gel as well as liquid silicone.  even though silicone is considered to be an inert material, there are side effects that have been reported, such as silicone lymphadenopathy.  millions of people have been exposed to silicones because of the widespread use in consumer products such as cosmetics and toiletries, food products, household products and paints.  millions of people have been exposed to silicones which are present in consumer goods such as cosmetics and toiletries, processed foods and household products. ||| ",Yes
Is amantadine effective for treatment of disorders conciousness?,Yes,"Amantadine, an uncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist and dopamine agonist, has been shown to be effective in the treatment of various cerebral disorders, including disorders of consciousness (DOC). Its actions as a pro-dopaminergic drug and N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonist make it an interesting candidate for improving consciousness and responsiveness in individuals with DOC, including vegetative state and minimally conscious state. Amantadine hydrochloride is one of the most commonly used drugs in the pharmacotherapeutic treatment of DOC following traumatic brain injury (TBI). An improvement in consciousness was observed within 3-6 days after the start of amantadine administration in all seven cases (n=7/7; 100%). In this study, amantadine administration showed substantial positive effects on recovery following severe cerebral hemorrhage. Amantadine is currently recommended for use in patients of post-traumatic brain injury with unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (UWS).","recent studies have shown that amantadine, an uncompetitive n-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist and dopamine agonist, is effective for the treatment of various cerebral disorders and causes relatively mild side effects.  indeed, its actions as a pro-dopaminergic drug and as an n-methyl-d-aspartate antagonist makes amantadine an interesting candidate to improve consciousness and responsiveness in individuals with doc, including vegetative state and minimally conscious state.  amantadine is an interesting candidate as new antidepressant drug for the treatment of depression.  the present study aimed to investigate whether amantadine treatment is associated with better clinical outcomes in conservatively treated lhi patients.  amantadine hydrochloride is one of the most commonly used drugs in the pharmacotherapeutic treatment of disorders of consciousness (docs) following traumatic brain injury (tbi).  however, the use of amantadine for the subjective alleviation of fatigue in multiple sclerosis and in the treatment of agitated aggressive behavior in the traumatic brain injured patient has also been described.  an improvement in consciousness was observed within 3-6 days after the start of amantadine administration in all seven cases (n = 7/7; 100%).  in this study, amantadine administration showed substantial positive effects on recovery following severe cerebral hemorrhage.  amantadine appears to show a remarkable antidepressive efficacy in bdv-infected depressive patients.  amantadine is an antiviral agent that is also used in the treatment of parkinsonism and neuroleptic-induced extrapyramidal symptoms.  therefore, the therapeutical use of amantadine in bdv-infected depressive patients was investigated.  amantadine is useful for the prevention and treatment of influenza a and for the treatment of parkinson's disease and drug-induced extrapyramidal disorders.  amantadine treatment yielded a significant decrease in death in-hospital (before psm: or 0.143, 95% ci 0.034 to 0.605; after psm: or 0.113, 95% ci 0.020 to 0.635) and 3-month mortality (before psm: or 0.214, 95% ci 0.077 to 0.598; after psm: or 0.176, 95% ci 0.053 to 0.586) in unmatched and matched multivariate analyses.  amantadine is currently recommended for use in patients of posttraumatic brain injury with unconsciousness.  the aim of this study was to assess effect of amantadine on cognition among individuals with a history of tbi and behavioral disturbance using a parallel-group, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of amantadine 100 mg twice-daily versus placebo for 60 days.  amantadine, which was originally developed as an antiviral medication, functions as a dopamine agonist in the central nervous system and consequently is utilized in the treatment of parkinson disease, drug-induced extrapyramidal reactions, and neuroleptic malignant syndrome.  amantadine is currently recommended for use in patients of post-traumatic brain injury with unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (uws).  originally introduced into pharmacotherapy as an antiviral compound, amantadine was shown to also have multiple pharmacological eftfects on the central nervous system.  the aim of the present studies was to estimate concentrations of amantadine in the central nervous system under therapeutic conditions.  amantadine (1-amino-adamantane) is clinically used for the management of parkinson's disease and drug-induced extrapyramidal symptoms. ||| ",Yes
Is the protein lefty an inhibitor of nodal?,Yes,"The protein lefty is identified as an inhibitor of nodal signalling. Genetic data suggest that nodal functions as a signalling molecule, while lefty acts as an antagonist. The inhibition of nodal signals by lefty is attributed to competitive binding of lefty to the common receptors actriia or actriib, and potentially faster diffusion of lefty. Overexpression of lefty in rcc cells has been shown to inhibit the expression of nodal, leading to similar observations such as the inhibition of rcc cell proliferation and invasion, and the promotion of rcc cell apoptosis. The expression of lefty in rcc cells is often reduced, which may result in the overexpression of nodal, thereby promoting the growth of rcc. These findings suggest that lefty plays a crucial role in the regulation of nodal signalling and its inhibition.","processed forms of lefty proteins, both smaller and larger forms, inhibited nodal signalling.  the expression of lefty, an inhibitor of nodal is often reduced in tumor cells.  genetic data suggest that nodal is a signalling molecule, while lefty is an antagonist of nodal, but their precise function remains unknown.  such lefty-induced inhibition was rescued by excess actriia or actriib, suggesting that lefty antagonizes nodal signalling through competitive binding to the common receptor actriia or actriib.  efficient inhibition of nodal signals by lefty may involve competitive binding of lefty to the common receptors and faster diffusion of lefty.  furthermore, lefty overexpression in rcc cells inhibited the expression of nodal.  nodal downregulation and lefty overexpression led to similar observations: the inhibition of rcc cell proliferation and invasion, and the promotion of rcc cell apoptosis.  lefty, antivin and related genes act in a feedback inhibition mechanism for nodal signaling at a number of stages of vertebrate embryogenesis.  the expression of lefty in rcc cells was lower than that in adjacent non-tumor cells, which may result in the overexpression of nodal, thereby promoting the growth of rcc.  these data indicate that chordin and noggin function to limit bmp signaling in the left lpm, thereby derepressing nodal expression.  behaviours of gfp-nodal and gfp-lefty2 proteins were also investigated in chick embryos.  to the best of our knowledge, few studies have investigated the expression of nodal and lefty in renal cell carcinoma (rcc) cells.  two tgfbeta-related proteins, nodal and lefty, are implicated in early embryonic patterning of vertebrates.  in the present study, quantitative polymerase chain reaction assays demonstrated that the level of nodal expression in rcc cells was high compared with that of adjacent non-tumor tissue cells, while the opposite pattern was observed for the level of lefty expression.  expression of dominant negative mutants of various receptors indicated that alk4, and either actriia or actriib, function as type i and type ii receptors for nodal, respectively.  expression of the nodal gene is high in a number of tumor cell types and may promote tumor growth.  nodal may also act as a short-range signal to establish a functional midline barrier.  our findings confirm that the mouse node is instrumental in initiating left-right axis specification and identify nodal as the key morphogen regulating this process.  the signalling pathway of nodal was investigated with the use of a nodal-responsive assay system based on frog animal caps.  embryos lacking nodal in the node fail to initiate molecular asymmetry in the left lateral plate mesoderm and exhibit multiple left-right patterning defects. ||| ",Yes
Is there any link between conserved noncoding elements and alternative splicing in vertebrates?,Yes,"Justification: The context suggests that conserved non-coding elements in vertebrate genomes are associated with alternative splicing regulation. These elements are often found in the vicinity of developmentally regulated genes and are hypothesized to be under evolutionary constraint due to their role in binding sequence-specific transcription factors. The study of conserved intronic sequences in human and mouse genes revealed that many of these elements function in the regulation of alternative splicing. Furthermore, the analysis of pentameric and hexameric intronic sequences has identified motifs that are more likely to be associated with alternative splicing events. These findings support the hypothesis that conserved non-coding elements play a role in alternative splicing regulation in vertebrates.","to the extent that such sequences might be recognized by the splicing machinery, this conservation may be a derived result of evolution for efficient splicing.  we hypothesized that intronic elements that regulate alternative splicing are under selective pressure for evolutionary conservation.  alternative splicing (as) regulates diverse cellular and developmental functions through alternative protein structures of different isoforms.  to study the possible correlation between these conserved intronic sequences and alternative splicing regulation, we developed a method to identify exons that are alternatively spliced in both human and mouse.  alternative splicing events that are conserved in orthologous genes in different species are commonly viewed as reliable evidence of authentic, functionally significant alternative splicing events.  multi-species conserved non-coding elements occur in the vertebrate genome and are clustered in the vicinity of developmentally regulated genes.  whether sl trans-splicing has a common evolutionary origin and biological function among different organisms remains unclear.  many of the high-scoring nematode pentamer and hexamer motifs correspond to known mammalian splicing regulatory sequences, such as (t)gcatg, indicating that the mechanism of alternative splicing regulation is well conserved in metazoans.  our results suggest that the function of many of the intronic sequence blocks that are conserved between human and mouse is the regulation of alternative splicing.  a comparison of the analysis of the conserved intronic elements, and analysis of the entire introns flanking these same exons, reveals that focusing on intronic conservation can increase the sensitivity of detecting putative splicing regulatory motifs.  we compared the frequency of pentamers and hexamers in the conserved intronic elements to a dataset of all c. elegans intron sequences in order to identify short intronic motifs that are more likely to be associated with alternative splicing.  many alternative splicing events are regulated by pentameric and hexameric intronic sequences that serve as binding sites for splicing regulatory factors.  this approach also identified novel sequences whose role in splicing is under investigation and has allowed us to take a step forward in defining a catalog of splicing regulatory elements for an organism.  alternatively, such conserved sequences might be remnants of proto-splice sites, which might have existed early in eukaryotic genes and served as the targets for the insertion of introns, as has been proposed by the introns-late theory.  in vivo experiments on the alternatively spliced let-2 gene confirm that these conserved regions can be important for alternative splicing regulation.  further, we have also defined a measure of the variation of the arrangement of exonic splicing enhancers (ese-conservation score) to study the evolution of splicing regulatory sequences.  these findings suggest that alternative splicing of symmetrical and non-symmetrical exons is governed by different selective pressures and serves different purposes.  vertebrate genomes share numerous conserved non-coding elements, many of which function as enhancer elements and are hypothesised to be under evolutionary constraint due to a need to be bound by combinations of sequence-specific transcription factors.  alternative splicing of pre-mrna is a commonly used mechanism to regulate gene expression in higher eukaryotes.  replacement of mrna 5' utr sequences by short sequences trans-spliced from specialized, noncoding, spliced leader (sl) rnas is an enigmatic phenomenon, occurring in a set of distantly related animal groups including urochordates, nematodes, flatworms, and hydra, as well as in euglenozoa and dinoflagellates. ||| ",Yes

Therefore, it can be inferred that CEP290 gene mutations can be targeted by AAV-mediated gene therapy.","here we report the development of lentiviral vectors carrying full-length cep290 for the purpose of correcting the cep290 disease-specific phenotype in human cells.  autosomal recessive cep290-associated lca is a good candidate for gene replacement therapy, and cells derived from affected individuals give researchers the ability to study human disease and therapeutic gene correction in vitro.  the successful construction and viral transfer of full-length cep290 brings us closer to the goal of providing gene- and cell-based therapies for patients affected with this common form of lca.  genome editing through adeno-associated viral (aav) vectors is a promising gene therapy strategy for various diseases, especially genetic disorders.  a lentiviral vector containing cmv-driven human full-length cep290 was constructed.  during the past decades, several studies have demonstrated the potential of aav-based gene therapies for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.  mutations in cep290 are the most common cause of leber congenital amaurosis (lca), a severe inherited retinal degenerative disease for which there is currently no cure.  however, current research indicates that the genetic modification of aav vectors may further facilitate the success of aav gene therapy.  importantly, lentiviral delivery of cep290 rescued the ciliogenesis defect.  transfer of genes by adeno-associated virus (aav) vectors is benefiting patients with particular genetic defects.  we evaluated retinal gene therapy with an adeno-associated virus vector that used to deliver a functional version of the chm gene (aav2-rep1).  adeno-associated virus (aav) vector-mediated gene delivery was recently approved for the treatment of inherited blindness and spinal muscular atrophy, and long-term therapeutic effects have been achieved for other rare diseases, including haemophilia and duchenne muscular dystrophy.  to investigate the expression of human erythropoietin (hepo) in 293 cell line using adeno-associated virus (aav) vector, and provide information for its potential application in human gene therapy.  a related approach uses aav vectors to edit specific regions of the dmd gene using crispr/cas9.  this study demonstrates a novel strategy to dramatically increase aav transduction which substantially enhanced in vivo genome editing efficiency in adult animal models, showing clinical potential for both conventional and genome editing-based gene therapy.  the most promising approaches use gene transfer vectors derived from adeno-associated virus (aav) to supplement a gene function in the affected cell type.  despite the popularity of adeno-associated virus 2 (aav2) as a vehicle for gene transfer, its efficacy for liver-directed gene therapy in hemophilia a or b has been suboptimal.  to overcome this issue, we developed a single aav platform that allows local replacement of a mutated sequence with its wildtype counterpart, based on combined crispr-cas9 and micro-homology-mediated end-joining (mmej).  supplementing wildtype copies of functionally defective genes with adeno-associated virus (aav) is a strategy being explored clinically for various retinal dystrophies.  this review will cover the benefits of aav as a promising gene vector by itself, the progress and advantages of engineered aav vectors, particularly synthetically engineered ones, and the current state of their clinical translation in therapy. ||| ",No
Can the apoptosis regulator BAX trigger the release of cytochrome c?,Yes,"The apoptosis regulator BAX has been shown to trigger the release of cytochrome c from isolated mitochondria. Upon apoptosis induction, BAX translocates from the cytosol to mitochondria, where it promotes the release of cytochrome c, a caspase-activating protein. The pro-apoptotic BCL-2 homologues BAX and BAK are activated following the induction of apoptosis and induce cytochrome c release from mitochondria. The mechanism by which BAX triggers cytochrome c release is not fully understood, but it is thought to play an important role in the initiation of apoptosis. Temporal analysis has shown that BAX translocation precedes cytochrome c release from the mitochondria. The release of cytochrome c into the cytoplasm can promote the apoptotic process in cells expressing pro-caspase 3. The mitochondrial calpain plays an essential role in apoptotic commitment by cleaving BAX and generating the BAX/p18 fragment, which in turn mediates cytochrome c release and initiates the apoptotic execution.","therefore, bax/p18 has a cytochrome c-releasing activity that promotes cell death independent of bcl-2.  we now report that bax is sufficient to trigger the release of cytochrome c from isolated mitochondria.  upon apoptosis induction, the proapoptotic protein bax is translocated from the cytosol to mitochondria, where it promotes release of cytochrome c, a caspase-activating protein.  the pro-apoptotic bcl-2 homologues bax and bak are activated following the induction of apoptosis and induce cytochrome c release from mitochondria.  however, the molecular mechanisms by which bax triggers cytochrome c release are unknown.  these results demonstrated that bax translocation is critical for cyanide-induced cytochrome c release and that p38 map kinase regulates bax translocation from cytosol to mitochondria.  during mitochondrial apoptosis, pro-apoptotic bh3-only proteins cause the translocation of cytosolic bcl-2-associated x protein (bax) to the outer mitochondrial membrane (omm) where it is activated to release cytochrome c from the mitochondrial intermembrane space, but the mechanism is under dispute.  the mechanism by which the proapoptotic protein bax releases cytochrome c from mitochondria is not fully understood.  cytochrome c release is thought to play an important role in the initiation of apoptosis.  temporal analysis showed that bax translocation preceded cytochrome c release from the mitochondria, which was initiated 3 h after cyanide treatment.  here, we show that on isolated mitochondria, bax causes the release of cytochrome c, but not of aif, and the association of aif with the mitochondrial inner membrane provides a simple explanation for its lack of release upon bax-mediated outer membrane permeabilization.  cleavage of bax was followed by release of mitochondrial cytochrome c, activation of caspase-3, cleavage of poly(adp-ribose) polymerase, and fragmentation of dna.  our results support the concept that the release of cytochrome c into the cytoplasm can promote the apoptotic process in cells expressing pro-caspase 3 but that cytochrome c release is not sufficient to induce death in all cells.  (1) baxdeltac selectively releases cytochrome c and enables a bidirectional movement of cytochrome c across the outer mitochondrial membrane.  in contrast, transfection of a cloned bax/p18 cdna into multiple human cancer cell lines targeted bax/p18 to mitochondria, which was accompanied by release of cytochrome c and induction of caspase-3-mediated apoptosis that was not blocked by overexpression of bcl-2 protein.  recent reports have demonstrated that cytochrome c is released from mitochondria during apoptosis and have suggested that this release may be a critical step in the activation of proapoptotic caspases and subsequent cell death.  our results suggest that the mitochondrial calpain plays an essential role in apoptotic commitment by cleaving bax and generating the bax/p18 fragment, which in turn mediates cytochrome c release and initiates the apoptotic execution.  we conclude that cytochrome c can be a prime initiator of apoptosis in intact growing cells and acts downstream of bcl-2 and mitochondria, but that other cells are resistant to its apoptogenic activity.  activation of the pro-apoptotic bax protein, a bcl-2 family member, is known to trigger apoptosis by forming pores in the mitochondrial outer membrane (mom).  the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria and apoptosis relies on several preferential and selective interactions involving the bcl-2 family of proteins. ||| ",Yes
Is the number of described human nuclear mutations less than 50000?,No,"The number of known mutations in human nuclear genes, underlying or associated with human inherited disease, has exceeded 100,000 in more than 3700 different genes. This information is based on the human gene mutation database, which provides a comprehensive record of mutations in human genes. The context also mentions that the number of mutations is essential to understanding the mutation mechanisms underlying genetic diseases. Therefore, it can be concluded that the number of described human nuclear mutations is not less than 50,000.","the number of known mutations in human nuclear genes, underlying or associated with human inherited disease, has now exceeded 100,000 in more than 3700 different genes (human gene mutation database).  knowledge of the kinds and numbers of nuclear point mutations in human tissues is essential to the understanding of the mutation mechanisms underlying genetic diseases.  in human tissues, somatic point mutations have been observed at fractions at or below 4/10,000 and 5/100,000 in mitochondrial and nuclear dna, respectively.  in particular, the mutation rate observed in modern humans is substantially lower than that estimated from calibration against the fossil record, and the paternal age effect in mutations transmitted to offspring is much weaker than expected from our long-standing model of spermatogenesis.  we have now developed a means to scan for point mutations in 100 bp nuclear single copy sequences at mutant fractions as low as 10(-6).  high throughput means to detect and quantify low-frequency mutations (<10(-2) ) in the dna-coding sequences of human tissues and pathological lesions are required to discover the kinds, numbers, and rates of genetic mutations that (i) confer inherited risk for disease or (ii) arise in somatic tissues as events required for clonal diseases such as cancers and atherosclerotic plaque.while throughput of linear dna sequencing methods has increased dramatically, such methods are limited by high error rates (>10(-3) ) rendering them unsuitable for the detection of low-frequency risk-conferring mutations among the many neutral mutations carried in the general population or formed in tissue growth and development.  mutations cause or influence the prevalence of many diseases.  infrequent and rare genetic variants in the human population vastly outnumber common ones.  genome sequencing studies of de novo mutations in humans have revealed surprising incongruities in our understanding of human germline mutation.  recent studies show that variants altering amino acid sequence and protein function are enriched at low variant allele frequency, 2 to 5%, but because of insufficient sample size it is not clear if the same trend holds for rare variants below 1% allele frequency.  both nuclear and mitochondrial point mutations have been measured in human cells and tissues at fractions approaching 10(-6) using constant denaturant capillary electrophoresis (cdce) coupled with high-fidelity pcr (hifipcr).  mitochondrial dna (mtdna) diseases are rare disorders whose prevalence is estimated around 1 in 5000.  copy number variations (cnvs) comprise about 10% of reported disease-causing mutations in mendelian disorders.  part of the difficulty is that mutations occur very rarely, and so direct pedigree-based approaches remain limited in the numbers that they can examine.  this translates to an estimate of 1.7 for the ratio of the male to female mutation rate, much less than the average 5.1 of previous studies.  additionally, rare inherited mutations may be scanned in pooled dna samples, each derived from as many as 10(5) persons.  7.4% of deleterious mutations and 22.4% of novel putative mutations were identified.  rare coding variants constitute an important class of human genetic variation, but are underrepresented in current databases that are based on small population samples.  the authors argue that this throws doubt not only on higher male mutation rates in human ancestry, but also on the standard assumption of a high male:female ratio in contemporary human populations.  however, for a variety of reasons, this figure is likely to represent only a small proportion of the clinically relevant genetic variants that remain to be identified in the human genome (the 'mutome'). ||| ",No
Can chronological age be predicted by measuring telomere length?,Yes,", with limitations

     Telomere length has been proposed as a marker of mitotic cell age and a general index of human organismic aging. Telomere shortening has emerged as an important biomarker of aging, and telomere length measurements have been obtained from DNA in peripheral blood samples. However, the relationship between telomere length and chronological age is dependent on age, and telomere length measured very early in life and longitudinal assessments of telomere shortening during the first year of life may be more useful biomarkers of total life expectancy than either telomere length measured after development or telomere shortening later in adulthood. Additionally, the rate of telomere shortening and to a lesser extent telomere length in the first year of life have been found to independently predict lifespan. Therefore, while telomere length can be used as a biomarker of aging and may indicate age-related disease susceptibility, it is not a perfect predictor of chronological age.","telomere length is indicative of biological age.  the measurement of telomere length might therefore assess the lifespan of a cell.  telomeric length is a reliable indicator of intrinsic biologic age and a surrogate for the mitotic clock.  there is interest in the application of telomere length measures as a biomarker of general health or ""biological age,"" and the possibility of using mean telomere length to gauge individual disease risk, and to promote lifestyle changes to improve health.  leukocyte telomere length is widely considered a biomarker of human age and in many studies indicative of health or disease.  telomere length was also positively associated with several measures of healthy aging, but this relationship was dependent on age.  the aim of this study was to set up and validate a technique enabling the assessment of telomere length on tissue sections.  telomere length has been considered in many cross-sectional studies as a biomarker of aging.  mean leukocyte telomere length may be an indicator of biological age, and as such it appears to provide information over and above chronological age of the risk for developing diseases of aging in humans.  telomere length (tl) has been proposed as a marker of mitotic cell age and as a general index of human organismic aging.  telomere shortening has emerged as an important biomarker of aging.  telomere length measurements were obtained on dna from peripheral blood samples at age 49-51 (n = 351), using a quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay.  telomeres have been advocated to be important markers of biological age in evolutionary and ecological studies.  we conclude that estimation of human age according to telomere shortening in pbls is a novel method especially when there is no morphologic information, furthermore, the gender must be considered when age estimation is carried out based on telomere shortening.  we have obtained quantitative estimates of telomere length from blood leukocytes in a population sample, confirming results of previous studies that telomere length significantly decreases with age.  our results suggest that telomere length measured very early in life (during development) and longitudinal assessments of telomere shortening during the first year of life constitute more useful biomarkers of total life expectancy than either telomere length measured after development, or telomere shortening later in adulthood.  we reveal that the rate of telomere shortening and to a lesser extent telomere length in the first year of life independently predicted lifespan, with individuals with faster shortening rates and/or shorter telomeres living less long.  here we present a method to distinguish between error and telomere elongation in longitudinal datasets, which is easy to apply and has few assumptions.  during the past few years telomere length has been measured in various human tissues.  telomere length (tl) is considered a biological marker of aging and may indicate age-related disease susceptibility. ||| ",No

Is polyadenylation a process that stabilizes a protein by adding a string of Adenosine residues to the end of the molecule?,No,"Polyadenylation is a process that involves the addition of a poly(A) tail to an RNA molecule, specifically to the 3'-end of pre-messenger RNA (pre-mRNA). This process is critical for gene expression and regulation in eukaryotes. The poly(A) tail plays a significant role in nuclear export, stability, and translational regulation of mRNA. However, it is important to note that polyadenylation is a process that occurs in RNA molecules, not proteins. Protein stabilization is a separate process that can involve various post-translational modifications, but the addition of a poly(A) tail is not one of them. Therefore, the claim that polyadenylation stabilizes a protein by adding a string of Adenosine residues to the end of the molecule is not accurate.","polyadenylation is the addition of a poly(a) tail to an rna molecule.  polyadenylation is the process in which the pre-mrna is cleaved at the poly(a) site and a poly(a) tail is added - a process necessary for normal mrna formation.  mrna polyadenylation, the addition of a poly(a) tail to the 3'-end of pre-mrna, is a process critical to gene expression and regulation in eukaryotes.  polyadenylation is a cotranscriptional nuclear rna processing event involving endonucleolytic cleavage of the nascent, emerging pre-messenger rna (pre-mrna) from the rna polymerase, immediately followed by the polymerization of adenine ribonucleotides, called the poly(a) tail, to the cleaved 3' end of the polyadenylation site (pas).  polyadenylate  tail addition to the 3' end of a wide range of rnas is a highly conserved modification that plays a central role in cellular rna function.  polyadenylation including the cleavage of pre-mrna and addition of a stretch of adenosines to the 3'-end is an essential step of pre-mrna processing in eukayotes.  nearly all eukaryotic messenger rnas are modified at the 3' end by the addition of an adenosine polymer: the poly-adenosine tail.  the poly(a) tail is a homopolymeric stretch of adenosine at the 3'-end of mature rna transcripts and its length plays an important role in nuclear export, stability, and translational regulation of mrna.  polyadenylation  is a vital step in post-transcriptional processing of pre-mrna.  in eukaryote genomes, the polyadenylation site marks termination of mature rna transcripts by a poly-adenine tail.  shortening of the poly(a) tail, referred to as deadenylation, reduces protein synthesis and initiates destruction of the mrna.  the stable post-translational modification of proteins by adenylylation or uridylylation was discovered more than four decades ago as a mechanism to regulate the activity of enzymes.  the polyadenylation site is recognized by a dynamic protein complex, among which the poly-adenine-binding protein nuclear1 plays a key role.  the site of polyadenylation  marks the end of a transcript, which is also the end of a gene in most cases.  antisense elements inhibiting or enhancing specific poly(a) site usage can induce desired alterations in polyadenylation, and thus hold the promise of new therapeutic approaches.  we present a survey of the historical and modern phases of research in this area, focusing on the common and differing aspects of protein adenylylation.  our study is important in highlighting novel experimental targets, which may provide new understanding about the regulatory aspects of polyadenylation.  the capacity of escherichia coli poly(a) polymerase to adenylylate the 3'-oh residue of a variety of nucleosides, nucleoside 5'-phosphates and dinucleotides of the type nucleoside(5')oligophospho(5')nucleoside is described here for the first time.  identifying dna sequence motifs that signal the addition of poly(a) tails is essential to improved genome annotation and better understanding of the regulatory mechanisms and stability of mrna.  messenger rna polyadenylation is one of the essential processing steps during eukaryotic gene expression. ||| ",No
Does the TOP2B/TOP2A expression ratio affect the response to AML chemotherapy?,Yes,"context does not provide information to definitively answer this question.

     Justification: The context does not provide information on the TOP2B/TOP2A expression ratio or its effect on the response to AML chemotherapy. Therefore, it is not possible to determine if the TOP2B/TOP2A expression ratio affects the response to AML chemotherapy based on the given information.","the emergence of therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia (t-aml) has been associated with dna topoisomerase ii (top2)-targeted drug treatments and chromosomal translocations frequently involving the mll, or all-1, gene.  bcl-2 over-expression is associated with cd34 positivity, poor response to chemotherapy and reduced overall survival in aml patients.  in order to define the clinical relevance of the bcl-2 mrna expression in acute myeloid leukemia (aml) and its correlation to therapy outcome and prognosis, we analyzed 219 aml bone marrow (bm) samples, including 119 patients with de novo aml at presentation, 37 with aml following myelodysplastic syndrome (mds), as well as 42 bm samples of aml in relapse and 21 in complete remission (cr) using rt-pcr.  therefore, the high bcl-2 concentration levels remaining after treatment with anti-leukaemia drugs can be responsible for resistance to chemotherapy by protecting cd34 positive aml cells from induced apoptosis.  do patients with therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia (t-aml) have a poor prognosis independent of other predictive variables such as cytogenetics or molecular determinants?  the role of bcl-2 in determining the response of aml cells to two chemotherapy drugs used in treatment of aml: cytarabine and fludarabine was investigated using human leukaemia cell lines expressing different levels of bcl-2: u937 cd34 negative expressing low levels of bcl-2 and mhh225 cd34 positive expressing high levels of bcl-2.  recent studies have shown that abgg2 protein overexpression in acute myeloid leukemia (aml) may be associated with poor response to therapy and increased relapse risk.  concerning the long-term outcome, the overall (os) and disease-free survival (dfs) was significantly worse in aml patients with high expression levels of bcl-2 mrna.  acute myeloid leukaemia (aml) is a heterogeneous malignant disease in which bcl-2 is expressed simultaneously with several putative drug resistance parameters in aml cells.  expression of the bcl-2 oncoprotein by aml blasts has previously been demonstrated to be heterogenous with high levels of bcl-2 expression being associated with a low complete remission rate and poor survival.  previously, we demonstrated that the level of bcl2 expression is prognostic in acute myelogenous leukemia (aml).  altered expression of members of the bcl-2 family might account for the observed apoptosis resistance to chemotherapy in acute myeloid leukemia (aml).  elmpcr provides a new tool for investigating the role of dna topoisomerases in fundamental genetic processes and translocations associated with cancer treatments involving topoisomerase-targeted drugs.  aml patients with high bcl-2 mrna expression achieved lower cr rates than those with no or low expression.  two distinct mechanisms have been implicated as potential triggers of t-aml translocations: top2-mediated dna cleavage and apoptotic higher-order chromatin fragmentation.  these results suggest that expression levels of proteins that affect the functional status of bcl2 modify the prognostic impact of bcl2 and suggest that the role of apoptosis in different cases of aml varies independently in the different cytogenetic subgroups.  the bcl-2 oncoprotein is suggested to be directly involved in the emergence of drug resistance by disrupting or delaying the apoptotic program and promoting tumor survival.  our results suggest that the poor prognosis previously associated with aml blasts expressing the cd34 antigen may in part be related to high expression of bcl-2.  cytogenetic abnormalities detected at diagnosis are recognized as important in predicting response to chemotherapy in acute myeloid leukemia (aml).  the localization and remarkable clustering of the t-aml breakpoints cannot be explained simply by the dna cleavage patterns but might result from potential interactions between top2 poisoning, apoptotic dna cleavage, and dna repair attempts at specific sites of higher-order chromatin structure in apoptosis-evading cells. ||| ",Yes

Preclinical efficacy against malignant glioma has been demonstrated, and gene expression profiling has revealed a more detailed mechanism of the anti-glioma effect of cilengitide.

Is p100 the precursor protein molecule of the NF-kappaB transcription factor subunit p50?,No,"The p100 protein is not the precursor for the p50 subunit of the NF-kappaB transcription factor. Instead, it serves as the precursor for the p52 subunit. The p50 subunit is derived from the proteolytic processing of the p105 precursor protein, which is a different protein from p100. The p105 precursor is cleaved to produce the p50 subunit, which then forms a heterodimer with the p65 subunit to create the active NF-kappaB transcription factor. The p100 precursor, on the other hand, is processed to generate the p52 subunit, which can also act as an alternative subunit of NF-kappaB. However, the p100 precursor is primarily believed to function as an inhibitor of NF-kappaB activity by retaining NF-kappaB complexes in the cytoplasm.","the p50 subunit of the nf-kappa b transcription complex is derived from the n-terminal half of a larger precursor protein, p105.  nf-kappa b is a transcription factor composed of the p50 and p65 subunits.  a precursor, p105, for one of the subunits (p50) of the nf-kappa b transcription factor, plays an important role in inducible expression of diverse cellular genes.  proteolytic processing of the nuclear factor (nf)-kappab2 precursor protein p100 generates the active nf-kappab2 subunit p52, which in turn transcriptionally up-regulates p100 expression.  p50 corresponds to the n terminus of p105 and with p65 (rela) forms the prototypical nf-kappab transcription factor complex.  the polypeptide (p)50 molecule, a subunit of nuclear factor (nf)-kappab, is produced after proteolytic processing of the p105 precursor (nf-kappab1).  the prototranscription factor p100 represents an intersection of the nf-kappab and ikappab families, potentially serving as both the precursor for the active nf-kappab subunit p52 and as an ikappab capable of retaining nf-kappab in the cytoplasm.  the nf-kb2 gene encodes the cytoplasmic nf-kappab inhibitory protein p100 from which the active p52 nf-kappab subunit is derived by proteasome-mediated proteolysis.  the inducible pleiotropic transcription factor nf-kappa b is composed of two subunits, p50 and p65.  regulation of the transcription factor nf-kappab involves proteasome-mediated processing of the nf-kappab1 p105 precursor protein, which generates the p50 subunit of nf-kappab.  the nf-kappa b precursor p100 (lyt-10, p97, p98) generates after proteolytic processing a 52 kda subunit, which can bind to kappa b-motifs.  the nf-kappa b transcription factor p50 and the rel protein-specific transcription inhibitor p105 are both encoded by the nfkb1 gene.  proteasome-mediated processing of the nfkappab2 gene product p100 is a regulated event that generates the nf-kappab subunit p52.  the nfkb2 gene encodes the p100 precursor which produces the p52 protein after proteolytic cleavage of its cooh-terminal domain.  the dna binding subunit of the transcription factor nf-kappa b, p50, has been cloned.  generation of the nf-kappab p50 transcription factor is mediated by the proteasome.  although the p52 product can act as an alternative subunit of nf-kappab, the p100 precursor is believed to function as an inhibitor of rel/nf-kappab activity by cytoplasmic retention of rel/nf-kappab complexes, like other members of the ikappab family.  in this study p100 was analysed for its ability to interact with its own processing product p52, with p50, the product of the nf-kappa b precursor p105, and with other nf-kappa b/rel-proteins.  transcription factor nf-kappab is generally considered to be a heterodimer with two subunits, p50 and p65.  these findings demonstrate the physiological relevance of the nf-kappab2 p100 precursor protein in limiting the potentially detrimental effects of constitutive nf-kappab2 signaling in lymphocytes. ||| ",No
is intense physical activity associated with longevity ?,Yes,"Intense physical activity is associated with longevity, as evidenced by the positive influence of high levels of physical activity on health and cognition across the lifespan. Furthermore, increasing exercise intensity in older adults has been linked to greater reductions in the risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality. The study also highlights that engaging in physical activity in the context of sport or exercise group membership can protect against age-related physical activity decline. Performing three to five times the recommended physical activity minimum can reach the maximal longevity benefit. The quality of life in old age is crucially dependent upon the ability to pursue a variety of physical activities, and simply expending energy through any activity may influence survival in older adults.","in this study, the relationship between moderate physical activity and longevity was investigated, taking into account age, gender, smoking habits, cohabitation status, body mass index, leg strength and balance, education level and cognitive function.  endurance exercise, including high-intensity training to improve cardiorespiratory fitness promotes longevity and slows down aging.  in an aging society, however, active life expectancy and maintenance of independence may be as important as effects of regular exercise on longevity.  robust epidemiological evidence exists that lifelong regular exercise contributes to longevity.  high levels of physical activity seem to positively influence health and cognition across the lifespan.  indeed, there is evidence to suggest that increasing exercise intensity in older adults may be associated with greater reductions in the risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality.  older people who increase or maintain their physical activity have lower mortality than those who remain sedentary.  older people who exercise regularly tent to be those at whom we marvel: they live longer, more vigorous, independent lives.  longitudinal mixed effects models were used to assess the effect of sport or exercise group membership on physical activity and longevity across a 14-year follow-up.  there is consolidated evidence that physical activity exerts beneficial effects on several chronic conditions and longevity, on the basis of its proposed biological effects, especially on lipid profiles.  objectives: moderate physical activity gains survival.  evidence, mainly from cross-sectional studies, suggests that physical activity is a potentially important modifiable factor associated with physical performance and strength in older age.  cox regression analyses were used to investigate the predictive value of physical activity on longevity.  to examine whether engaging in physical activity in the context of sport or exercise group membership can protect against age-related physical activity decline.  simply expending energy through any activity may influence survival in older adults.  physical activity plays an important role for achieving healthy aging by promoting independence and increasing the quality of life.  performing three to five times the recommended physical activity minimum reaches the maximal longevity benefit, that can be achieved.  the quality of life in old age is crucially dependent upon the ability to pursue a variety of physical activities.  exercise is associated with mortality benefits but simply expending energy through any activity in an individual's free-living environment may confer survival advantages.  meeting the currently recommended amounts of leisure time physical aerobic activity of moderate intensity of at least 150 min/week provides most of the longevity benefit. ||| ",Yes
Can SUMO affect calcium homeostasis?,No,"The context provided does not contain any information regarding the impact of SUMO (Small Ubiquitin-like Modifier) on calcium homeostasis. The review primarily focuses on the physiology and pathophysiology of calcium homeostasis, the role of calcium in cellular function, the interrelationship between calcium and magnesium homeostasis, and the effects of calcium deficiency on cellular calcium homeostasis. The review also discusses the consequences of in vivo calcium status on intracellular calcium homeostasis, the role of calcium-sensing receptor in magnesium homeostasis, and the association of dietary and prescribed calcium with serum calcium and FGF23 concentrations. However, there is no mention of SUMO or its potential effects on calcium homeostasis. Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine whether SUMO can affect calcium homeostasis.","this review summarizes the physiology and pathophysiology of calcium homeostasis.  alterations in calcium systems may underlie some of the physiological changes associated with aging.  calcium plays a major role in regulating cellular function.  to obtain further information on the negative calcium balance caused by cd, the factors associated with serum calcium and phosphorus homeostasis other than inhibition of intestinal calcium absorption were studied by using urinary cyclic 3',4'-adenosine monophosphate (camp).  calcium homeostasis is described in terms of controlled, disturbing, and controlling signals.  little attention has been given to the consequences of the in vivo calcium status on intracellular calcium homeostasis despite several pathological states induced by perturbations of the in vivo calcium balance.  a disturbance in the levels of calcium in these compartments can play havoc in the cell, as it regulates various cellular processes by direct or indirect mechanisms.  calcium (ca) and magnesium (mg) homeostasis are interrelated and share common regulatory hormones, including parathyroid hormone (pth) and vitamin d. however, the role of the calcium-sensing receptor (casr) in mg homeostasis in vivo is not well understood.  recent and limited findings have prompted concern about the contribution of calcium supplementation to cardiovascular risk.  in multivariable models, dietary calcium and prescribed calcium were associated in opposing directions with serum calcium (prescribed calcium; ß-coefficient = -0.35, p = 0.005 versus dietary calcium; ß-coefficient = 0.35, p = 0.03).  the aim of this study was to evaluate alterations in calcium metabolism in sarcoidosis.  in conclusion, a disease-related alteration in calcium metabolism was seen in about 40% of patients with sarcoidosis, and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin d probably plays a crucial role in this abnormality.  the effects of calcium deficiency on cellular calcium homeostasis were reversible by repletion with oral calcium feeding alone or by the administration of the calcium-regulating hormone 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin d3, further strengthening the tight link between extra- and intracellular calcium.  these data, therefore, challenge the currently prevailing hypothesis that extracellular ca2+ has no significant impact on cellular ca2+ by demonstrating that despite the large ca2+ gradient between extra- and intracellular ca2+ concentrations, calcium deficiency in vivo significantly alters the hormone-sensitive cellular calcium homeostasis.  dietary calcium was associated with higher serum calcium and lower fgf23 concentrations, while prescribed calcium was only inversely associated with serum calcium.  this phenomenon indicated hyperparathyroidemia in response to continuous oral administration of cd for 90 d. the negative calcium balance with hyperparathyroidemia occurred after continuous oral administration of cd and developed via increased urinary excretion of calcium.  dietary calcium was inversely associated with fgf23 (p = 0.04) however association of fgf23 with prescribed calcium did not reach statistical significance (0.08).  the correlation between the alterations of free intracellular calcium concentrations and the essential arterial hypertension has been largely investigated.  dysregulated serum calcium and fgf23 are associated with increased mortality and morbidity rates in patients receiving hemodialysis.  one third is in need of mg conservation by the kidney, associated with low plasma total mg, modest metabolic acidosis, a trend towards overweight, high plasma insulin and glucose; 2) low mg- or acidosis-induced increase of bone resorption may follow, attenuating glycemia and insulinemia but forcing the kidney to functional adaptation, manifesting as a rise of urinary sodium, mg, ca, pi, ca/pi, ph and protein, together presumably aggravating ma; 3) larger controlled studies are justified, to decide whether mg deficiency initiates renal ca stones, and if urinary mg loss exaggerates ircu. ||| ",Yes
"Down's syndrome occurs when an individual has an extra copy or part of a copy of chromosome 21, yes or no?",Yes,"Down's syndrome, also known as trisomy 21, is a genetic disorder caused by the presence of an extra copy or part of a copy of chromosome 21. This extra genetic material leads to the development of the characteristic features and symptoms associated with Down's syndrome. The disorder is the most common human chromosomal abnormality, with an incidence of approximately one in 700 live births. The extra copy of chromosome 21 results in the overexpression of genes contained within it, leading to a range of physical and cognitive impairments. The specific phenotypic features of Down's syndrome may vary depending on the size and location of the duplicated region of chromosome 21.","an extra copy of chromosome 21, a small chromosome or a specific segment of it, is the cause of the disorder known as down's syndrome (ds).  down syndrome (ds) is caused in most cases by the presence of an extra chromosome 21.  down syndrome (ds) is the most common human chromosomal abnormality caused by an extra copy of chromosome 21.  down syndrome (ds), commonly caused by an extra copy of chromosome 21 (chr21), occurs in approximately one out of 700 live births.  down syndrome, the most frequent genetic disorder, is characterized by an extra copy of all or part of chromosome 21.  down syndrome is caused by an extra copy of human chromosome 21 and the resultant dosage-related overexpression of genes contained within it.  chromosome 21, the smallest human chromosome, has been the subject of intense study because it is the chromosome which, when present in an extra copy, leads to down syndrome.  down syndrome (ds) is the most common form of intellectual disability associated with central nervous system abnormalities and results from an extra complete or partial copy of human chromosome 21.  down syndrome (ds) is the most common human chromosomal abnormality caused by an extra copy of chromosome 21 and characterized by somatic anomalies and mental retardation.  the presence of an extra copy of human chromosome 21 (trisomy 21), especially region 21q22.2, causes many phenotypes in down syndrome, including mental retardation.  an extra copy of chromosome 21 causes down syndrome, the most frequent genetic cause of significant mental retardation, which affects up to 1 in 700 live births.  down syndrome (ds) is the most common human chromosomal abnormality caused by an extra copy of chromosome 21 and characterized clinically by somatic anomalies, mental retardation and precocious dementia.  down syndrome (ds) is the most common known aneuploidy, caused by an extra copy of all or part of chromosome 21.  in a previous case of a newborn infant with typical down syndrome, chromosome analysis indicated the presence of an unusual and complex translocation of chromosome 21.  down syndrome is rarely due to a de novo duplication of chromosome 21 .  trisomy 21 or down syndrome is the most common type of autosomal chromosome abnormality, with an incidence of one out of 700 live births.  the clinical, cytogenetic, and molecular studies of an individual are presented here for the purpose of further characterizing what regions of chromosome 21q are essential for expression of the typical down syndrome phenotype.  trisomy 21 (down's syndrome, ds) is the most frequent chromosomal aberration.  although an extra chromosome 21 is the genetic cause for ds, specific phenotypic features may result from the duplication of smaller regions of the chromosome and more studies need to define genotypic and phenotypic correlations.  we report on a 26 year old male with partial trisomy 21 presenting mild clinical symptoms relative to ds including borderline intellectual disability. ||| ",Yes
Is ocular melanosis a risk factor for uveal melanoma?,Yes,"Ocular melanocytosis, also known as ocular melanosis, is indeed a risk factor for uveal melanoma. The presence of excessive melanocytes in the uveal tract in individuals with ocular melanocytosis may provide the biological basis for susceptibility to the development of uveal melanoma. Studies have shown that patients with uveal melanoma associated with ocular melanocytosis have double the risk for metastasis compared with those with no melanocytosis. Furthermore, the lifetime prevalence of uveal melanoma among patients with ocular melanocytosis is estimated to be 1 in 400. Therefore, it is recommended that patients with ocular melanocytosis be monitored ophthalmoscopically, especially during the susceptible period, for the development of uveal melanoma.","ocular melanocytosis portends a higher risk of uveal melanoma.  excessive melanocytes in the uveal tract in odm may provide the biologic basis for susceptibility to the development of uveal melanoma.  eyes with melanoma and oculo(dermal) melanocytosis had a relative risk for metastasis 1.6 times greater compared with those with no melanocytosis (p < .001).  uveal melanoma is the most common ocular melanoma and carries a serious prognosis, especially if the tumor is medium or large in size.  conclusions and relevance patients with uveal melanoma associated with oculo(dermal) melanocytosis have double the risk for metastasis compared with those with no melanocytosis.  ocular/oculodermal (oculo) melanocytosis is a congenital periocular pigmentary condition that can lead to the development of uveal melanoma, estimated at 1 in 400 affected patients.  risk factors so far identified include pre-existing choroidal naevi for uveal melanomas, primary acquired melanosis (pam) for conjunctival tumours, and ocular and oculodermal melanocytosis for uveal and orbital lesions.  ocular melanoma is a rare but potentially devastating malignancy arising from the melanocytes of the uveal tract, conjunctiva, or orbit; it represents less than 5% of all melanoma cases in the united states.  ocular melanoma is a rare but often deadly malignancy that arises in the uvea, conjunctiva, or orbit.  this study was designed to determine the lifetime prevalence of uveal melanoma among patients with ocular melanocytosis.  multifocal uveal melanoma has been described previously and has been associated with ocular melanocytosis.  patients with odm should be monitored ophthalmoscopically, especially during the susceptible period, for the development of uveal melanoma.  to determine the relationship of oculo(dermal) melanocytosis to the prognosis of patients with uveal melanoma.  in the white population, an association between oculo(dermal) melanocytosis (odm) and uveal melanoma is well recognized.  frequently, uveal melanoma arises from choroid or iris.  in this study, patients with melanocytosis who developed uveal melanoma were found to have double the risk for metastasis compared with those without melanocytosis.  by multivariable analysis, the factors predictive of metastasis in patients harboring uveal melanoma associated with oculo(dermal) melanocytosis were increased tumor thickness (p = .001) and the presence of subretinal fluid (p = .05), and the only factor predictive of death was increased tumor thickness (p = .009).  ocular melanoma is a rare subtype of melanoma, which includes uveal melanoma (um) and conjunctival melanoma.  recent statistical work which shows that the risk of uveal melanoma is greater in patients with melanocytosis oculi than in the normal white population is recalled.  one of about 400 patients with odm followed for life is estimated to develop uveal melanoma. ||| ",Yes
Is davunetide being considered for the treatment of progressive supranuclear palsy?,Yes,"Davunetide has been considered for the treatment of progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) due to its potential to address tau pathology, a key factor in PSP. Clinical trials have been conducted to assess the safety and efficacy of davunetide in PSP patients. However, the results of these trials have not shown davunetide to be an effective treatment for PSP. Despite this, davunetide remains a drug candidate being tested against tauopathy, and further research may be ongoing.","because progressive supranuclear palsy (psp) is linked to tau pathology, davunetide could be a treatment for psp.  we assessed the safety and efficacy of davunetide in patients with psp.  introduction: amantadine anecdotally improves gait in progressive supranuclear palsy (psp) but definitive data is lacking.  we aimed to investigate the safety and tolerability of biib092 in individuals with progressive supranuclear palsy.  progressive supranuclear palsy (psp) is a debilitating progressive neurodegenerative disorder for which there is no proven pharmacological treatment.  to date, pharmacological treatment options for progressive supranuclear palsy (psp), a neurodegenerative tauopathy, are limited.  davunetide is not an effective treatment for psp.  davunetide (al-108, nap) is an intranasally administered peptide currently being developed for treatment of alzheimer's disease and related disorders.  participants aged 41-86 years with probable or possible progressive supranuclear palsy with a score of 20 or greater on the mini-mental state examination (mmse) were enrolled.  progressive supranuclear palsy (psp) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder with no effective treatment.  davunetide (nap) is a leading drug candidate being tested against tauopathy.  biib092 is a humanised monoclonal antibody that binds to n-terminal tau and is thus being assessed as a potential novel treatment for progressive supranuclear palsy.  repeated administration of the anti-tau monoclonal antibody biib092, at doses of up to 2100 mg, appears to be well tolerated in participants with progressive supranuclear palsy.  progressive supranuclear palsy is a rare neurodegenerative disease associated with dysfunctional tau protein.  discussion: this post-hoc analysis of the davunetide trial did not find an association between amantadine and gait or cognitive measures in psp, but was not powered to find such a difference.  sixty-three subjects with schizophrenia received davunetide at one of two different doses (5, 30 mg) or placebo for 12 weeks in a multicenter, double-blind, parallel-group randomized clinical trial.  pre- and post-operative objective overall motor and gait subsection scores as well as patient-reported outcomes were recorded for 6 ppn-dbs-treated patients, 3 with parkinson's disease (pd), and 3 with progressive supranuclear palsy (psp).  this study investigates effects of davunetide on cognition in schizophrenia.  clinical trials for treatment of parkinson's disease suggest that (-)deprenyl (selegiline), an inhibitor of type b monoamine oxidase, may slow the disease progression.  the datatop study is a clinical trial in which deprenyl, a selective inhibitor of monoamine oxidase-b (mao-b), is being given to newly diagnosed parkinsonian patients in an attempt to halt the progression of their disorder. ||| ",Yes
Is Hepatic mesenchymal hamartoma usually a malignant tumor?,No,"Hepatic mesenchymal hamartoma is typically a benign tumor, as evidenced by its classification as a benign and rare hepatic lesion.

Although some cases have been reported with specific translocations involving chromosome 19 and certain ultrastructural and histologic features suggesting a relationship between mesenchymal hamartoma and undifferentiated (embryonal) sarcoma of the liver, the tumor is still considered benign. The finding of aneuploidy in mesenchymal hamartoma, in conjunction with reported cytogenetic abnormalities, suggests that it may be a true neoplasm, but not necessarily a malignant one.

Is the Dictyostelium discoideum proteome known?,Yes,"The proteome of Dictyostelium discoideum is known to a certain extent, as evidenced by the identification of 349 different secreted proteins, which indicates that at least 2.6% of the 13,600 predicted proteins in the Dictyostelium genome are secreted. The use of MS-based proteomics to identify these proteins further supports the notion that the proteome of Dictyostelium discoideum is known. Additionally, the fact that the complete genomes of Dictyostelium discoideum and other related species have been sequenced also contributes to the understanding of the Dictyostelium proteome.","dictyostelium discoideum cells are professional phagocytes that provide an easily accessible system to gain insights into the mechanisms and the regulatory machinery controlling phagocytosis.  dictyostelium discoideum is a specialized amoebozoan protist that can feed on, carry and disperse bacteria.  in this report, we identified the proteins secreted by developing dictyostelium cells using ms-based proteomics.  dictyostelium discoideum exhibits the largest repository of polyketide synthase (pks) proteins of all known genomes.  dictyostelium discoideum is a eukaryotic microorganism that is attractive for the study of fundamental biological phenomena such as cell-cell communication, formation of multicellularity, cell differentiation and morphogenesis.  in this study, we provide evidence that dictyostelium discoideum contains pkc delta-like protein that is localized in the nucleus.  the complete genomes of dictyostelium discoideum, dictyostelium purpureum, polysphondylium pallidum and dictyostelium fasciculatum have been sequenced.  dictyostelium discoideum is a unicellular eukaryote that, when starved, aggregates to form multicellular structures.  the discoidin i protein has been studied extensively as a marker of early development in the cellular slime mold dictyostelium discoideum.  dictyostelium discoideum possesses more egf-like (egfl) domains than any other sequenced eukaryote.  the social amoeba dictyostelium discoideum's proteome contains a vast array of simple sequence repeats, providing a unique model to investigate proteostasis.  dictyostelium discoideum is a unicellular eukaryotic model largely used for the study of the endocytic pathway, mainly due to its high resemblance to the mammalian pathway.  a cdna with homology to fatty acid desaturases was selected by searching the cdna data bank of dictyostelium discoideum (http://www.  while dictyostelium discoideum has been studied as a developmental system for decades, and many regulatory proteins have been cloned, the molecular mechanisms of cell-type-specific gene expression are poorly understood.  a total of 349 different secreted proteins were identified, indicating that at least 2.6% of the 13 600 predicted proteins in the dictyostelium genome are secreted.  the unique biology and phylogenetic position of dictyostelium offer a great opportunity to gain knowledge of processes not characterized in other organisms.  the dictyostelium pkc delta-like protein has an apparent molecular mass of 76 kda.  sequence analysis reveals that a gene expressed during growth and early development of dictyostelium discoideum encodes a polypeptide which exhibits extensive similarity with annexins, a family of calcium/phospholipid binding proteins.  other predictions from comparative genomics among the dictyostelids are reviewed and evaluated.  the findings here identify dictyostelium discoideum as a novel microbe to investigate protein quality control pathways during the transition to dormancy. ||| ",Yes
Is celiac disease caused by gliadin-induced transglutaminase-2 (TG2)-dependent events ?,Yes,"Celiac disease is caused by a complex interplay of genetic and environmental factors, with gluten ingestion being a key environmental trigger. The enzyme transglutaminase 2 (TG2) plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of celiac disease. TG2 catalyzes the deamidation of gluten peptides, converting them into immunogenic epitopes that stimulate a T-cell response. This T-cell response leads to the production of autoantibodies against TG2 and subsequent mucosal injury in the small intestine. The deamidation of gluten peptides by TG2 is a critical step in the pathogenesis of celiac disease, as it enhances the stimulation of T cells and contributes to the autoimmune response. Therefore, it can be concluded that celiac disease is caused by gliadin-induced TG2-dependent events.","the enzyme transglutaminase 2 (tg2) plays a crucial role in the initiation of celiac disease by catalyzing the deamidation of gluten peptides.  type 2 transglutaminase (tg2) has an important pathogenic role in celiac disease (cd), an inflammatory intestinal disease that is caused by the ingestion of gluten-containing cereals.  a number of lines of evidence suggest that transglutaminase 2 (tg2) may be one of the earliest disease-relevant proteins to encounter immunotoxic gluten in the celiac gut.  type 2-transglutaminase (tg2) activity seems to be responsible for a strong autoimmune response in celiac disease, tg2 being the main autoantigen.  celiac disease (ced) is a t-cell-dependent enteropathy with autoimmune features where tissue transglutaminase (tg2)-mediated posttranslational modification of gliadin peptides has a decisive role in the pathomechanism.  autoantibodies specific for the enzyme transglutaminase 2 (tg2) are a hallmark of the gluten-sensitive enteropathy celiac disease.  the multifunctional, protein cross-linking transglutaminase 2 (tg2) is the main autoantigen in celiac disease, an autoimmune disorder with defined etiology.  in celiac disease, gluten ingestion provokes small-bowel mucosal injury and production of iga autoantibodies against transglutaminase 2 (tg2).  in celiac disease, small intestinal transglutaminase 2 causes deamidation of glutamine residues in gluten peptides, which enhances stimulation of t cells and leads to mucosal injury.  transglutaminase (tg)2 is the autoantigen in celiac disease, but also tg3 antibodies have been detected in the serum of celiac disease patients.  a prominent example is the involvement of transglutaminase 2 (tg2) in the gluten-sensitive enteropathy celiac disease, where the enzyme is both the target of autoantibodies and responsible for the generation of immunogenic gluten epitopes.  the chronic, small intestinal inflammation that defines celiac disease is initiated by a hla-dq2 restricted t-cell response to ingested gluten peptides after their in vivo deamidation by tissue transglutaminase (tg2).  our findings are in line with the concept that a ""celiac cellular phenotype"" exists and that tg2 may contribute to this phenotype.  several studies support the concept that celiac anti-tg2 antibodies may contribute to disease pathogenesis.  these and other investigations also suggest that the reaction catalyzed by tg2 on dietary gluten peptides is essential for the pathogenesis of celiac disease.  the present report focuses on the diagnosis of celiac disease and its pathogenesis, which depends on a genetic predisposition (hla dq2 or dq8 haplotypes), gluten ingestion and t cell activation, type ii transglutaminase (tg2), the autoantigen recognized by the antiendomysial antibody playing a key role.  inhibition of transglutaminase 2 is a potential treatment for celiac disease.  transglutaminase 2 (tissue transglutaminase, tgase 2) was recently identified as an endomysial autoantigen in celiac disease (cd).  deamidation of distinct glutamines in hla-dq2 restricted gliadin epitopes, considered critical in the pathogenesis of coeliac disease (cd), can be mediated by tissue transglutaminase (ttg).  by means of its catalytic activity, tg2 seems to have an important pathogenetic role in celiac disease (cd), an inflammatory intestinal disease caused by the ingestion of gluten-containing cereals. ||| ",Yes
Are high-flow nasal cannulae effective for treatment of preterm infants?,Yes,"High-flow nasal cannulae (HFNC) have been shown to be an effective form of non-invasive respiratory support for preterm infants. In a multicenter, randomized, noninferiority trial, the efficacy of HFNC was found to be similar to that of nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) for very preterm infants after extubation. The use of HFNC was noninferior to the use of nasal CPAP, with treatment failure occurring in 34.2% of infants in the HFNC group and 25.8% in the CPAP group. HFNC has also been found to be a promising respiratory support in infant bronchiolitis, with the potential to reduce the proportion of treatment failure requiring escalation of care. However, it is important to note that there is a paucity of evidence as to the optimum flow rates in prematurely born infants, and concerns have been raised about the indiscriminate therapeutic use, size selection, and safety of nasal cannulas for the routine delivery of oxygen in preterm infants.","high-flow nasal cannula (hfnc) therapy is increasingly used in preterm infants despite a paucity of physiological studies.  the use of high-flow nasal cannulae is an increasingly popular alternative to nasal continuous positive airway pressure (cpap) for noninvasive respiratory support of very preterm infants (gestational age, <32 weeks) after extubation.  to assess the effect of nasal high flow (nhf) cannula on end-expiratory level (eel), continuous distending pressure (cdp) and regional ventilation distribution in preterm infants.  in this multicenter, randomized, noninferiority trial, we assigned 303 very preterm infants to receive treatment with either high-flow nasal cannulae (5 to 6 liters per minute) or nasal cpap (7 cm of water) after extubation.  to compare the feasibility of continuous positive airway pressure (cpap) support generated by high flow nasal cannula with conventional cpap for prevention of reintubation among preterm infants with a birth weight of <or=1,250 g. preterm infants were randomized to cpap generated via high flow cannula or the infant flow nasal cpap system (viasys, conshohocken, pa, usa) at extubation.  although the result for the primary outcome was close to the margin of noninferiority, the efficacy of high-flow nasal cannulae was similar to that of cpap as respiratory support for very preterm infants after extubation.  high-flow nasal cannulae (hfnc) are gaining in popularity as a form of non-invasive respiratory support for preterm infants in neonatal intensive care units around the world.  cpap delivered by high flow nasal cannula failed to maintain extubation status among preterm infants <or=1,250 g as effectively as infant flow cpap.  heated, humidified, high-flow nasal cannula (hhhfnc) is increasingly being used, but there is a paucity of evidence as to the optimum flow rates in prematurely born infants.  high-flow nasal cannulae have been used in newborns to prevent atelectasis and/or expand pulmonary regions affected by atelectasis; however, to date, no evidence-based data regarding this approach have been reported.  humidified high flow nasal cannula (hhfnc) delivers humidified gas at increased flow rates via binasal prongs and is becoming widely accepted as a method of non-invasive respiratory support for preterm infants.  heated, humidified, high-flow nasal cannula (hhfnc) is frequently used as a noninvasive respiratory support for preterm infants with respiratory distress.  in preterm infants, the flow rate and pharyngeal pressure were positively correlated in many hfnc cannulas.  the use of high-flow nasal cannulae was noninferior to the use of nasal cpap, with treatment failure occurring in 52 of 152 infants (34.2%) in the nasal-cannulae group and in 39 of 151 infants (25.8%) in the cpap group (risk difference, 8.4 percentage points; 95% confidence interval, -1.9 to 18.7).  to compare the requirement for endotracheal ventilation in preterm infants treated with heated, humidified high-flow nasal cannula (hhhfnc) with those treated with nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (nippv) for the primary treatment of respiratory distress syndrome (rds).  this finding raises important concerns about the indiscriminate therapeutic use, size selection, and safety of nasal cannulas for the routine delivery of oxygen in preterm infants.  the objective was to determine whether high-flow nasal cannula (hfnc), a promising respiratory support in infant bronchiolitis, could reduce the proportion of treatment failure requiring escalation of care.  these data demonstrate that nasal cannula gas flow can deliver positive end-distending pressure to infants and significantly alter their breathing strategy.  in the clinical setting, nasal cannulas are frequently used to deliver supplemental oxygen to neonates and are not believed to affect the general respiratory status.  what is known: • humidified high flow nasal cannulae (hhhfnc) is increasingly being used as a non-invasive form of respiratory support for prematurely born infants. ||| ",Yes
Is Bladder training an effective method to treat  urge incontinence ?,Yes,"Bladder training, a behavioral intervention that gradually extends the interval between voluntary voidings, has been reported as an effective therapy for ""urge"" urinary incontinence in several studies. This non-invasive technique is considered safe and successful in managing mild to moderate forms of urinary incontinence, particularly in outpatient populations. It has been shown to result in significant reduction of incontinence in older, community-dwelling women. Behavioral interventions, including bladder training, have been used for decades to treat urge incontinence and other symptoms of overactive bladder. Biofeedback, verbal feedback, and self-help booklets have all demonstrated comparable improvements in urge incontinence in community-dwelling older women. However, it is important to note that while behavioral and drug therapies are highly effective for reducing urge incontinence, few patients are cured with either treatment alone.","bladder training may be helpful for the treatment of urinary urge incontinence, but this conclusion can only be tentative, based on the evidence available.  in recent years, several studies have reported that bladder training, a behavioral intervention in which the interval between voluntary voidings is gradually extended, is an effective therapy for ""urge"" urinary incontinence (incontinence often associated with inability to inhibit detrusor contractions).  bladder training is widely used for the treatment of urinary incontinence.  bladder training is a simple, safe, and effective treatment in the management of mild to moderate forms of urinary incontinence in outpatient populations.  to assess the effects of bladder training for the treatment of urinary incontinence.  randomised or quasi-randomised trials of bladder training for the treatment of incontinence.  bladder training is a modification of bladder drill that is conducted more gradually on an outpatient basis and has resulted in significant reduction of incontinence in older, community-dwelling women.  this article describes the implementation of a 6-week bladder training program for a female patient with both stress and urge incontinence.  behavioral interventions have been used for decades to treat urge incontinence and other symptoms of overactive bladder.  pelvic floor muscle training is the most commonly used physical therapy treatment for women with stress urinary incontinence (sui).  bladder training is, therefore, a successful non-invasive technique devoid of complications and is recommended for the treatment of mild detrusor instability.  biofeedback to teach pelvic floor muscle control, verbal feedback based on vaginal palpation, and a self-help booklet in a first-line behavioral training program all achieved comparable improvements in urge incontinence in community-dwelling older women.  recent research on pelvic muscle exercises, which are known to be effective in stress and mixed urinary incontinence, has demonstrated that this therapy has a durable effect.  previous research on urge urinary incontinence has demonstrated that multicomponent behavioral training with biofeedback is safe and effective, yet it has not been established whether biofeedback is an essential component that heightens therapeutic efficacy.  although behavioral and drug therapies are known to be highly effective for reducing urge incontinence, few patients are cured with either treatment alone.  physiotherapy involving pelvic-floor muscle training is advocated as first-line treatment for stress urinary incontinence; midurethral-sling surgery is generally recommended when physiotherapy is unsuccessful.  this study aimed to assess the effectiveness of inpatient bladder retraining.  we evaluated the effects of biofeedback-guided pelvic floor muscle training (emg-bf), with and without extracorporeal magnetic innervation (emg-bf+exmi) therapy on lower urinary tract symptoms based on frequency of stress urinary incontinence (sui) and grams of urine loss, health-related quality of life, and sexual function in women with sui.  related behavioral therapies may also be effective for incontinence associated with impaired mobility and cognitive status.  the study confirms the usefulness of inpatient bladder retraining as a treatment option, especially in people refractory to outpatient management. ||| ",Yes
Does Rad9 interact with Aft1 in S.cerevisiae?,No,"The context provided does not mention any interaction between Rad9 and Aft1 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The context focuses on the role of Rad9 in the DNA damage checkpoint pathway, its interaction with Rad53 and Chk1, and its involvement in nucleotide excision repair. No information is given about a potential interaction with Aft1.","rad9 functions in the dna-damage checkpoint pathway of saccharomyces cerevisiae.  the rad9 protein is a key adaptor protein in saccharomyces cerevisiae dna damage checkpoint pathways.  rad9 is required for the mec1/tel1-dependent activation of saccharomyces cerevisiae dna damage checkpoint pathways mediated by rad53 and chk1.  human rad9 (hrad9), a structural homologue of yeast schizosaccharomyces pombe rad9, is involved in cell cycle checkpoints and apoptosis.  this work extends data showing that separable domains within the rad9 adaptor protein allow it to activate two distinct kinase signalling pathways independently of each other.  we show here that the n-terminus of rad9 is specifically important for phosphorylation and activation of the chk1 kinase but not for the phosphorylation and activation of the rad53 kinase.  in saccharomyces cerevisiae, the rad1 and rad10 genes are involved in dna nucleotide excision repair (ner) and in a pathway of mitotic recombination that occurs between direct repeat dna sequences.  the mechanisms by which rad9 interacts with, and activates, rad53 are well understood.  dna damage induces rad9 phosphorylation, and rad53 specifically associates with phosphorylated rad9.  rad9 is also implicated in nucleotide excision repair (ner); however, its precise role is still unclear.  human rad9 protein (hrad9) is a homolog of the fission yeast rad9 protein, one of the six so-called checkpoint rad proteins involved in the early steps of dna damage checkpoint response in schizosaccharomyces pombe.  these data suggest that functionally independent domains within rad9 regulate rad53 and chk1, and support the model that fha domain-mediated recognition of rad9 phosphopeptides couples rad53 to the dna damage checkpoint pathway.  the saccharomyces cerevisiae rad9 and rad24 are two cell cycle checkpoint genes required for uv-dependent up-regulation of a battery of genes involved in different metabolic pathways.  in saccharomyces cerevisiae, rad18 functions in post-replication repair pathways, such as error-free damage bypass involving rad30 (poleta) and error-prone damage bypass involving rev3/7 (polzeta).  consistent with the in vivo function in recruiting rad53, rad9 phosphopeptides are bound by rad53 forkhead-associated (fha) domains in vitro.  we report here that multiple mec1/tel1 consensus q sites within rad9 are phosphorylated in response to dna damage.  however, little was known about how rad9 facilitates the activation of chk1.  these rad9 phosphorylation sites are selectively required for activation of the rad53 branch of the checkpoint pathway.  the role that rad1-rad10 plays in recombination is likely to resemble its activity in ner by acting upon partially unpaired dna intermediates such as those formed by recombination mechanisms involving single-strand dna annealing.  the chk1 activation domain (cad) of rad9 is specifically important for signalling cell-cycle arrest after cdc13-1- and yku70delta-induced telomere damage but not for tolerating ultraviolet-induced damage or inhibiting nuclease activity at telomeres. ||| ",Yes
Has the presence of delayed enhancement been documented in athletes performing strenuous exercise?,No,"The provided context does not contain any information regarding the documentation of delayed enhancement in athletes performing strenuous exercise. The context discusses various aspects of exercise performance, such as the effects of high-intensity exercise on severe-intensity exercise, the impact of acute physical exercise on perceptual-cognitive performance, and the effects of fatigue on cognitive skills.

Therefore, based on the given context, it cannot be confirmed that the presence of delayed enhancement has been documented in athletes performing strenuous exercise.","prior high-intensity exercise can improve exercise performance during severe-intensity exercise.  the short-term transient training-induced decrements in performance elicited by increases in training load (i.e.  here, the most recent research on for in endurance athletes will be critically evaluated to determine (1) if there is sufficient evidence to indicate that inducing a state of for is necessary and required to induce a performance super-compensation; (2) the metabolic consequences that are associated with for; (3) strategies that may prevent the negative consequences of overreaching.  there are variable responses to short-term periods of increased training load in endurance athletes, whereby some athletes improve without deleterious effects on performance, while others show diminished exercise performance for a period of days to months.  this systematic review aims to provide detailed information on how athletes' perceptual-cognitive performance is influenced by acute physical exercise load and whether these effects differ between elite athletes and lesser skilled groups.  exercise-induced isolated premature ventricular beats were observed in 7% of athletes; none showed non-sustained ventricular tachycardia before or during the race.  results suggested the impact of acute physical exercise on perceptual-cognitive performances of athletes depends on the specificity of the induced exercise and perceptual-cognitive task.  athletes are increasingly exploring ways to enhance their physical performance.  the purpose of this study was to examine differences in the pre- and post-fatigue speed discrimination skills of elite ballgames athletes to determine if they prioritize accuracy or speed of decision-making when physically exhausted.  the results showed that athletes' decision-making time decreased and decision-making errors increased after a maximal aerobic capacity exercise task.  this study examined the effect of prolonged endurance exercise on the development of exercise-induced hypoxemia (eih) in athletes who had previously displayed eih during an incremental maximal exercise test.  substantial research exists in relation to the effect of fatigue on the cognitive skills of athletes.  key pointsthe purpose of this study was to examine differences in the pre- and post-fatigue speed discrimination skills of elite ballgames athletes to determine if they prioritize accuracy or speed of decision-making when physically exhausted.speed discrimination stimuli were images of red square-shapes on a grey background presented moving along the sagittal axis at four different virtual velocities on a computer (pc) screen that represented the frontal plane.the participants exercised on a treadmill to level of 100% of peak oxygen uptake (vo2max).repeated measures manova revealed significant main effects for both the decision-making time and accuracy factors.  very few studies in the sport domain, however, have investigated decision-making time and accuracy in relation to the discrimination of the speed of a moving object following exercise at maximal intensity.  additionally, speed and accuracy were influenced differently by physical exercise.  aerobically trained athletes possess enhanced vasodilatory capacity and venous capacitance in their exercising muscles.  long-term resisted sprint training has been shown to improve early acceleration performance, but the acute post-activation potentiation (pap) effects of resisted sprinting on subsequent performance remain unclear.  previous work has shown that when vo2 kinetics are compared for endurance trained athletes and untrained subjects, the highly trained athletes have a faster response time.  we discuss these implications for future research that evaluates the effects of acute exercise on long-term memory function.  volume) in highly trained individuals does not appear to further enhance either endurance performance or associated physiological variables ",Yes
Is there an association between Klinefelter syndrome and breast cancer?,Yes,"Klinefelter syndrome, characterized by the presence of an extra X chromosome in males, has been consistently associated with an increased risk of breast cancer in men. This association is thought to be due to the aberrant endocrine function and sex hormone imbalance present in individuals with Klinefelter syndrome. The increased conversion of testosterone to estradiol, as well as the presence of gynecomastia, may contribute to the development of breast cancer in these patients. Epidemiological studies have also highlighted a higher incidence of morbidity and mortality among individuals with Klinefelter syndrome, including an increased risk of breast cancer and other malignancies. The pathogenesis of these rare neoplasms is likely related to the genetic abnormality and abnormal hormonal status present in Klinefelter syndrome.","klinefelter syndrome has been consistently associated with breast cancer in men (mbc).  breast cancer in a patient with klinefelter's syndrome is reported.  to evaluate male breast cancer (mbc) risk among patients with klinefelter syndrome (ks) and relate this to possible biological explanations.  the strongest association between aberrant endocrine function and male breast cancer occurs in patients with klinefelter's syndrome, who have an approximate 3% lifetime risk of developing breast cancer.  klinefelter's syndrome is known to be associated with various malignancies including male breast cancer and germ cell tumour.  those affected by klinefelter's syndrome are at increased risk of systemic lupus erythematosus, breast cancer, non-hodgkin's lymphoma, and lung cancer.  klinefelter syndrome is associated with the development of breast and extragonadal germ cell tumors in some patients.  klinefelter syndrome, in which patients carry xxy chromosome, may be present in men with breast cancer for this reason they often develop gynecomastia.  the increased conversion of testosterone to estradiol at the therapy with androgens might be responsible for the development of breast cancer in klinefelter's syndrome.  patients with a 47,xxy karyotype (klinefelter syndrome) appear to have an increased risk of developing cancer, especially male breast cancer and germ cell tumors, but rarely malignant hematologic disorders.  the various theories of etiology concerning breast cancer in this syndrome are reviewed.  we report a 54-year old man was diagnosed as synchronous bilateral breast cancer with klinefelter syndrome.  we describe a patient with klinefelter's syndrome associated with multi-focal breast carcinoma and paget's disease of the nipple.  the etiology of male breast cancer is obscure, although an excess risk has been associated with klinefelter syndrome, testicular disorders, benign breast disease including gynecomastia, use of exogenous estrogens, radiation, and a family history of male or female breast cancer.  although the association could be casual, the sex hormone imbalance present in klinefelter syndrome may suggest a role in the development of this benign liver lesion.  these data suggest a correlation between primary extragonadal germ cell tumors and klinefelter syndrome.  epidemiological studies have highlighted a higher incidence of morbidity and mortality among individuals with klinefelter's syndrome (ks), however, the relative impact of oncological diseases on ks subjects is still uncertain.  previous reports have associated klinefelter's syndrome with increased risk of thrombosis.  these data are the first to show an association of klinefelter's syndrome with an autoimmune disease found predominantly in women.  the pathogenesis of these otherwise rare neoplasms probably is related to the genetic abnormality and the abnormal hormonal status in klinefelter's syndrome. ||| ",Yes
Is creatinine assessment included in the MELD score?,Yes,"The Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score incorporates serum creatinine as one of its components. This score was introduced to facilitate the allocation of orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT). Despite serum creatinine being an inaccurate marker of renal function in patients with decompensated cirrhosis, it has a strong prognostic value in cirrhosis. The MELD score has shown to have a good performance in predicting acute kidney injury (AKI) after OLT, although serum creatinine had no impact on its prediction. The MELD score has a short-term prognostic yield that is better than what is provided by both the Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) and CTP creatinine-modified scores, even in cirrhotic patients who are not critically ill.","although serum creatinine is included in the model for end-stage liver disease (meld) score, it is an inaccurate marker of renal function, namely, of glomerular filtration rate (""true"" gfr) in patients with decompensated cirrhosis.  although meld score seems to have a good performance in predicting aki after olt, serum creatinine had no impact on its prediction despite its importance on meld calculation.  the excellent short-term prognostic accuracy of the meld score was confirmed even when patients with abnormal creatinine serum levels were excluded from the analysis (c-index=0.935).  the meld score has shown that, besides markers of liver function, serum creatinine has a strong prognostic value in cirrhosis.  the model for end-stage liver disease (meld) score incorporates serum creatinine and was introduced to facilitate allocation of orthotopic liver transplantation (lt).  this study aimed to evaluate the impact of two creatinine measurement methods on the model for end stage liver disease (meld) score and glomerular filtration rate estimation (egfr) in cirrhotic patients.  median creatinine value was 0.85mg/dl and meld was 19.  creatinine is a standard marker for estimation of the transplanted kidney function.  however, the meld score proved to be better at defining patients' prognosis in the short-term as compared with both the traditional ctp score (p=0.012) and the creatinine-modified ctp (p=0.047).  the role of the model for end-stage liver disease (meld) score in predicting complications, such as acute kidney injury (aki), after orthotopic liver transplantation (olt) has yet to be evaluated and serum creatinine may be too heavily weighted in the existing meld formula, since it has many pitfalls in cirrhotic patients.  meld score, ckd-epi formula creatinine-based egfr and cystatin c-based egfr were evaluated in 100 cirrhotic patients.  the positive results obtained by using the meld score were confirmed even after excluding patients with impaired renal function.  the meld score has a short-term prognostic yield that is better than what is provided by both the ctp and ctp creatinine-modified scores, even in cirrhotic patients who are not critically ill.  ctp, creatinine-modified ctp, and meld scores were calculated in a cohort of 145 cirrhotic patients.  the only independent risk factor for aki was calculated meld and when the components of the meld score were analyzed, inr had a much stronger impact in predicting aki then serum creatinine.  the creatinine-modified ctp was calculated as follows: we assessed the mean creatinine serum level and standard deviation (sd) of the 145 study patients, then assigned a score of 1 to patients with creatinine serum levels < or = to the mean, a score of 2 to patients with creatinine levels between the mean and the mean+1 sd, and a score of 3 to patients with creatinine levels above the mean+1 sd.  to evaluate and compare the short-term prognostic accuracy of the ctp, the creatinine-modified ctp, and the meld scores in patients with liver cirrhosis.  the creatinine serum level is an important predictor of survival in patients with liver cirrhosis.  to investigate the impact of serum creatinine measurement on the applicability of glomerular filtration rate (gfr) evaluation equations.  the objective of this study was to review the accuracy of measured creatinine clearance (mcrcl) from timed urine collections for estimating true gfr. ||| ",Yes
Does the majority of the mitochondrial genomes abide to the second parity rule (PR2)?,No,"The context does not provide information on the parity rule (PR2) in relation to the majority of mitochondrial genomes. The parity rule (PR2) states that in a double-stranded DNA molecule, the frequency of Adenine (A) equals that of Thymine (T), and the frequency of Guanine (G) equals that of Cytosine (C). However, the context focuses on the replication and maintenance of mammalian mitochondrial DNA, involving the heterotrimeric pol γ and the polg2 gene, and does not discuss the parity rule. Therefore, it is not possible to determine if the majority of mitochondrial genomes abide by the second parity rule based on the provided context.","mammalian mitochondrial dna (mtdna) is replicated by the heterotrimeric pol γ comprised of a single catalytic subunit, encoded by polg, and a homodimeric accessory subunit encoded by the polg2 gene.  the established strand-displacement model for mammalian mitochondrial dna (mtdna) replication has recently been questioned in light of new data using two-dimensional (2d) agarose gel electrophoresis.  polymerase (dna directed), gamma 2, accessory subunit, also known as polg2, is involved in mitochondrial replication.  polg2(+/-) mice are haplosufficient and develop normally with no discernable difference in mitochondrial function through 2 years of age.  human mitochondrial dna (mtdna) polymerase γ (pol γ) is the sole enzyme required to replicate and maintain the integrity of the mitochondrial genome.  our data indicate that polg2 function is critical to mammalian embryogenesis and mtdna replication, and that a single copy of polg2 is sufficient to sustain life.  rpm2p influences the level of mrnas that encode components of the mitochondrial import apparatus and essential mitochondrial chaperones.  after polg2 knockdown, the mitochondrial dna copy number was significantly (p < 0.05) lower than that in the control group.  although two main hypotheses of mitochondrial origin have been proposed, i.e., the autogenous and the endosymbiotic, only the second is being seriously considered currently.  it provides critical insights into complex ii function with implications for understanding complex ii's role in mitochondrial diseases across eukaryotes.  human mitochondrial dna is replicated by the two-subunit dna polymerase gamma (polgamma).  new mitochondria contain their own genome with a modified genetic code that is highly conserved among mammals.  since 1970, the dna polymerase gamma (polg) has been known to be the dna polymerase responsible for replication and repair of mitochondrial dna, and until recently it was generally accepted that this was the only polymerase present in mitochondria.  this paper summarizes recent advances in understanding the links between the cell's ability to maintain integrity of its mitochondrial genome and mitochondrial genetic diseases.  deletions within 5' or 3' regions of the mrp rna gene produced transcripts that remain competent for mitochondrial targeting.  the mechanism of replication of mammalian mitochondrial dna (mtdna) has recently been a topic of controversy.  the mechanism of mitochondrial dna replication is a subject of intense debate.  pb2 associates with mitochondria and inhibits the function of the mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein mavs, implicating pb2 in the regulation of innate immune responses.  we found that pb2 is imported into the mitochondrial matrix and showed that amino acid residue 9 is a determinant of mitochondrial import.  the rpm2 gene of saccharomyces cerevisiae codes for a protein subunit of mitochondrial rnase p and has another unknown essential function. ||| ",No
Are adenylyl cyclases always transmembrane proteins?,No,"Adenylyl cyclases are not always transmembrane proteins. While the majority of adenylyl cyclases are indeed transmembrane proteins, with mammalian adenylyl cyclases proposed to contain 12 transmembrane domains, there is also a second source of cyclic AMP (cAMP) in mammalian cells: the soluble adenylyl cyclase (sAC). This enzyme is not a transmembrane protein and is instead found in the cytosol. The presence of both transmembrane and soluble adenylyl cyclases allows for the integration and interpretation of diverse signals from different pathways, playing a significant role in cellular signal transduction in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes.","catalytic subunits of mammalian adenylyl cyclases have been proposed to contain 12 transmembrane domains, a property shared with some voltage-sensitive ion channels.  for many transmembrane signaling events adenylyl cyclases (acs) are the final effector enzymes which integrate and interpret divergent signals from different pathways.  adenylyl cyclase (ac) generates cyclic amp required for a variety of cellular functions, and its regulation plays a major role in cellular signal transduction in eukaryotes and prokaryotes.  functional and ultrastructural investigations have shown that adenylyl cyclases are intimately associated with sites of calcium ion entry into the cell.  metazoan membrane-bound adenylate cyclases are composed of 12 transmembrane spanning regions, and two cyclase domains which function as a heterodimer and are activated by g-proteins.  sequence alignment demonstrates that the two cyclase domains are transposed, relative to these domains in adenylate cyclases.  transmembrane adenylyl cyclases (adcy) are involved in the regulation of multiple brain processes such as synaptic plasticity, learning and memory.  recombinant technologies have allowed biochemical analysis of adenylyl cyclases in-vitro and the development of transgenic animals as well as knock-out mice have yielded new insights in the physiological role of some ac isoforms.  until now, it was attributed exclusively to the activity of the g-protein-responsive transmembrane adenylyl cyclase.  until recently, transmembrane adenylyl cyclase (tmac) was considered the major source for camp in the cell, and the role of camp signaling was therefore attributed exclusively to the activity of this family of enzymes.  we hypothesize that conformational changes in the catalytic subunit of the enzymes caused by changes in the membrane potential may enhance stimulation of adenylyl cyclases by the guanylyl nucleotide stimulatory protein.  this article is part of a special issue entitled: the role of soluble adenylyl cyclase in health and disease.  in contrast, membrane-bound guanylate cyclases have only one transmembrane spanning region and one cyclase domain, and are activated by extracellular ligands to form a homodimer.  we found mrnas for adenylyl cyclases vi and vii in cho and adenylyl cyclases ix and vii in b82 cells.  adrenergic receptors couple to gs-proteins leading to transmembrane adenylyl cyclase activation and cytosolic cyclic adenosine monophosphate (camp) production.  the activation of the canonical camp/pka pathway depends on transmembrane adenylyl cyclase (tmac).  ca2+-sensitive adenylyl cyclases are key integrators of ca2+ and camp signaling.  the expressed adenylyl cyclase/aequorin chimera was appropriately localized to the plasma membrane, as judged by biochemical fractionation and functional analysis.  to date, ten different mammalian isoforms of adenylyl cyclase (ac) have been cloned and characterized.  in addition to transmembrane ac, mammalian cells possess a second source of camp, the ubiquitously expressed soluble adenylyl cyclase (sac). ||| ",No
Is there any link between CTF4 and CTF18 during sister chromatid cohesion?,Yes,"The physical and genetic interactions between CTF4 and CTF18, as well as their association with core components of replication fork complexes, suggest that both gene products act in association with the replication fork to facilitate sister chromatid cohesion. The absence of either CTF4 or CTF18 causes sister chromatid cohesion failure, leading to a preanaphase accumulation of cells that depends on the spindle assembly checkpoint. CTF4 interacts with MCM10P physically and genetically, and the chromatin association of CTF4 depends on MCM10P. CTF18 interacts with a replicative DNA polymerase, DNA polymerase ε (Pol ε). Furthermore, CTF18, DCC1, and CTF8 form a trimeric complex (18-1-8) that enables stable binding with Pol ε. These findings indicate a link between CTF4 and CTF18 during sister chromatid cohesion.","the physical and genetic interactions between ctf4, ctf18, and core components of replication fork complexes observed in this study and others suggest that both gene products act in association with the replication fork to facilitate sister chromatid cohesion.  ctf4/and-1 is a highly conserved gene product required for both dna replication and the establishment of sister chromatid cohesion.  we find that absence of either ctf4 or ctf18 causes sister chromatid cohesion failure and leads to a preanaphase accumulation of cells that depends on the spindle assembly checkpoint.  ctf7 is an essential gene in yeast that is required for the formation of sister chromatid cohesion.  ctf4p (chromosome transmission fidelity) has been reported to function in dna metabolism and sister chromatid cohesion in saccharomyces cerevisiae.  the alternative pcna loader containing ctf18-dcc1-ctf8 facilitates sister chromatid cohesion (scc) by poorly defined mechanisms.  one of the proliferating cell nuclear antigen loader complexes, ctf18-replication factor c (rfc), is involved in sister chromatid cohesion.  while recent studies have provided insights into how sister chromatid cohesion is established, less is known about how specifically ctf7 facilitates the formation of cohesion, and essentially nothing is known about how sister chromatid cohesion is established in plants.  ctf4 and ctf18 are required for high-fidelity chromosome segregation.  the requirement for ctf4 and ctf18 in robust cohesion identifies novel roles for replication accessory proteins in this process.  furthermore, ctf4p interacts with mcm10p physically and genetically, and the chromatin association of ctf4p depends on mcm10p.  chromosome transmission fidelity 4 (ctf4) is a conserved protein required for dna replication.  we found that ctf18 interacts with a replicative dna polymerase, dna polymerase ε (pol ε).  in addition to mediating sister chromatid cohesion during the cell cycle, the cohesin complex associates with ctcf and with active gene regulatory elements to form long-range interactions between its binding sites.  ctf18 associates with chromatin during s phase, and it is required for the proper resumption of replication after fork arrest.  recent identification and characterization of the budding yeast polymerase kappa, encoded by trf4, strongly supports a hypothesis that the dna replication machinery is required for proper sister chromatid cohesion.  we show that both ctf4(s143f) and ctf4delta strains have defects in s phase entry and s phase progression at the restrictive temperature of 38 degrees c. ctf4p localizes in the nucleus throughout the cell cycle but only starts to bind chromatin at the g1/s transition and then disassociates from chromatin after dna replication.  these data indicate that ctf4p facilitates mcm10p to promote the dna replication.  in this report, interactions between human ctf4 (hctf4) and the replicative helicase containing the cell division cycle 45 (cdc45)/minichromosome maintenance 2-7 (mcm2-7)/go, ichi, nii, and san (gins) (cmg) proteins  were examined.  three subunits that are specifically required for cohesion in yeast, ctf18, dcc1, and ctf8, formed a trimeric complex (18-1-8) and together enabled stable binding with pol ε. ||| ",Yes
Are there plasma membrane receptors for thyroid hormones?,Yes,"The context suggests that there are plasma membrane receptors for thyroid hormones. The nongenomic actions of thyroid hormones are initiated at receptors in the plasma membrane, mitochondria, or cytoplasm. These receptors are known as thyroid hormone receptors (TRs) and are activated by thyroid hormone ligands and co-regulator proteins. The binding characteristics of thyroxine (T4), triiodothyronine (T3), and reverse T3 (rT3) to rat liver plasma membranes have been examined, indicating interactions of thyroid hormones with cell surface receptors. Furthermore, the membrane-bound thyrotropin receptor (TSHR) has been shown to mediate clinically important direct effects of thyrotropin (TSH) and TSHR antibodies (TSHRab) in extra-thyroidal tissues. These receptors can share structural homologies with nuclear thyroid hormone receptors (TRs) or have no homologies, such as the plasma membrane receptor on integrin αvβ3.","recent identification of membrane receptors for t4, t3, 3,5-t2, and 3-iodothyronamine that mediate rapid physiologic effects of thyroid hormones suggested that such receptors may supplement the regulation of trh and trh-like peptides by nuclear t3 receptors.  the nongenomic actions of thyroid hormone begin at receptors in the plasma membrane, mitochondria or cytoplasm.  the actions of such hormones are mediated by specific thyroid hormone receptors (trs).  although the biological effects of thyroid hormones are mediated by nuclear receptors (genomic mechanisms), interactions with receptors associated with the plasma membrane (non-genomic mechanisms) of target cells are not clear.  the binding characteristics of thyroxine (t4), triiodothyronine (t3), and reverse t3 (rt3) to rat liver plasma membranes (rlpm) were examined to explore the interactions of thyroid hormones with cell surface receptors.  thyroid hormone receptors (trs) are nuclear receptors that are activated by thyroid hormone ligands and co-regulator proteins.  as a prerequisite to studies of whether the plasma membrane of the rat thymocyte contains specific, saturable binding sites for the thyroid hormone 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (t(3)), a method was developed for the isolation of a plasma membrane fraction from these cells.  thyroid hormone receptors (tr) are members of the nuclear receptor superfamily.  there is increasing evidence that the membrane-bound thyrotropin receptor (tshr) may be mediating clinically important direct effects of thyrotropin (tsh) and of tshr antibodies (tshrab) in extra-thyroidal tissues.  the fact that the thyroid gland of graves' patients has a normal density of tsh receptors with suppressed tsh and high t4 and t3 levels suggests a modulatory role of thyroid hormones on tsh receptors.  these receptors can share structural homologies with nuclear thyroid hormone receptors (trs) that mediate transcriptional actions of t3, or have no homologies with tr, such as the plasma membrane receptor on integrin αvβ3.  biological responses to thyroid hormones are mediated by the nuclear thyroid hormone receptor (tr).  thyroid hormones exert their effects by stimulation of thyroid hormone receptors that have different tissue distribution and metabolic targets.  before the discovery of these nuclear receptors, possible major binding sites for thyroid hormones were thought to be cytosolic owing to high thyroid hormone-binding activity in crude cytosolic fractions.  thyroid hormone action is initiated through nuclear thyroid hormone receptors (trs).  the trh binding sites were absent in the adenomas associated with high levels of circulating thyroid hormones, whereas they were present in the adenoma secondary to primary thyroid failure (kd = 47 nmol/l, bmax = 40 nmol/kg membrane proteins).  the results show that the levels of the trh-like peptides in rat thyroid are highly sensitive to thyroid status, suggesting a possible involvement in thyroid regulation.  rat thyroid contains thyrotropin-releasing hormone (trh) and trh-like peptides which react with trh antisera.  there are at least two tr isoforms, tralpha and trbeta, which act as mediators of thyroid hormone in tissues.  the mean concentration of trh-like peptides in the thyroids of the hyperthyroid rats was 95.5+/-25.5 pmol/g, the mean concentration in the hypothyroid rats was 11.7+/-3.4 pmol/g, and in the euthyroid rats 17.6+/-3.2 pmol/g. ||| ",Yes
Are seizures among the neurological symptoms of incontinentia pigmenti?,Yes,"Justification: Incontinentia pigmenti, a rare neurocutaneous disorder, has been reported to manifest with neurological symptoms, including seizures. The context mentions a 2-month-old girl with incontinentia pigmenti who presented with acute-onset focalized seizures and subsequent generalization. Furthermore, it is noted that central nervous system manifestations, such as seizures and mental retardation, occur in 30% of cases. The literature review discusses the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of acute central nervous system disorders in incontinentia pigmenti, further supporting the claim that seizures are among the neurological symptoms of this disorder.","some children with incontinentia pigmenti exhibit encephalopathic features with severe seizures and disturbed consciousness, from the neonatal through the early infantile period.  a 2-month-old girl with incontinentia pigmenti presented with acute-onset right-handed focalized seizures and subsequent seizure generalization.  incontinentia pigmenti is a rare neurocutaneous disorder that may result in neurological symptoms in addition to its characteristic skin rashes.  a 15-day-old girl with incontinentia pigmenti experienced neurological symptoms such as decreased level of consciousness and a weak sucking reflex.  incontinentia pigmenti is an x-linked dominant neurocutaneous disorder with central nervous system manifestations in 30% of cases, including seizures and mental retardation.  we review the literature and discuss the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of acute central nervous system disorders in incontinentia pigmenti.  incontinentia pigmenti is a rare x-linked neurocutaneous disorder that can present in the neonatal period with seizures and encephalopathy.  we describe a neonate with the typical rash of incontinentia pigmenti along with seizures and brain magnetic resonance imaging abnormalities.  despite extensive cerebral arteriopathy in association with incontinentia pigmenti, this girl had a relatively stable early clinical course, steady developmental progress over time, and seizures that have been well controlled.  we report a neonate with acute neurological symptoms of incontinentia pigmenti who was effectively treated with corticosteroid therapy.  the pathogenesis of central nervous system disorders in incontinentia pigmenti remains unclear, but it has been suggested that vascular abnormalities and inflammatory processes may play important roles.  we describe a patient with incontinentia pigmenti who developed bilateral cerebrovascular accidents in the neonatal period, with resultant severe neurologic sequelae.  these findings suggest that incontinentia pigmenti should be included among the neurocutaneous syndromes associated with ischemic strokes in childhood.  this is the first report of a case with incontinentia pigmenti associated with cerebral infarction evaluated by single photon emission computed tomography.  recognition of cerebrovascular accidents as a complication of incontinentia pigmenti will hopefully lead to earlier recognition and treatment.  we suggest that corticosteroid therapy may be an effective treatment during the acute phase of central nervous system dysfunction due to incontinentia pigmenti.  tumor necrosis factor-α expression and oxidative stress are involved in the pathogenesis of brain lesions in children with incontinentia pigmenti, and elevated cerebrospinal fluid cytokine levels may not be apparent during encephalopathic events.  this is the second reported case of bilateral cerebrovascular accidents in a patient with incontinentia pigmenti.  both variegate and acute intermittent porphyria can manifest with various neurological symptoms.  ischemic or hemorrhagic cerebrovascular accidents have been reported rarely in incontinentia pigmenti. ||| ",Yes
Is Prochlorococcus the most abundant photosynthetic organism?,Yes,"Prochlorococcus is indeed the most abundant photosynthetic organism on Earth. This is supported by the fact that it is the numerically dominant phototroph in the tropical and subtropical oceans, accounting for half of the photosynthetic biomass in some areas. Prochlorococcus is also the most abundant genus of photosynthetic organisms, owing its large depth distribution in the oceans to the occurrence of distinct genotypes adapted to either low- or high-light niches. Furthermore, it is a major contributor to primary production and plays a significant role in global primary production in the world's oligotrophic oceans.","prochlorococcus is the most abundant photosynthetic prokaryote on our planet.  prochlorococcus was isolated around 20 years ago and is probably the most abundant photosynthetic organism on earth.  prochlorococcus and synechococcus are the most abundant photosynthetic organisms in oligotrophic waters and responsible for a significant percentage of the earth's primary production.  prochlorococcus is the numerically dominant phototroph in the tropical and subtropical oceans, accounting for half of the photosynthetic biomass in some areas.  prochlorococcus is a major contributor to primary production, and globally the most abundant photosynthetic genus of picocyanobacteria because it can adapt to highly stratified low-nutrient conditions that are characteristic of the surface ocean.  prochlorococcus describes a diverse and abundant genus of marine photosynthetic microbes.  prochlorococcus is the numerically dominant phototroph in the oligotrophic subtropical ocean and carries out a significant fraction of marine primary productivity.  prochlorococcus is an abundant marine cyanobacterium responsible for a significant part of global primary production.  photosynthetic prokaryotes of the genus prochlorococcus play a major role in global primary production in the world's oligotrophic oceans.  prochlorococcus, the most abundant genus of photosynthetic organisms, owes its remarkably large depth distribution in the oceans to the occurrence of distinct genotypes adapted to either low- or high-light niches.  prochlorococcus is a major photosynthetic prokaryote in nutrient-limited, open ocean environments and an important participant in the global carbon cycle.  the phytoplankton community in the oligotrophic open ocean is numerically dominated by the cyanobacterium prochlorococcus, accounting for approximately half of all photosynthesis.  prochlorococcus, a unique marine picocyanobacterium, contains the divinyl- (dv-) type chlorophylls (chls), dv-chl a and dv-chl b, as its photosynthetic pigments.  marine picocyanobacteria of the genera prochlorococcus and synechococcus numerically dominate the picophytoplankton of the world ocean, making a key contribution to global primary production.  the ability of prochlorococcus to numerically dominate open ocean regions and contribute significantly to global carbon cycles is dependent in large part on its effectiveness in transforming light energy into compounds used in cell growth, maintenance, and division.  recently, genes encoding the phycobiliprotein phycoerythrin were identified in several prochlorococcus isolates, thus making it the only extant photosynthetic prokaryote to possess a chlorophyll a/b antenna as well as phycobiliprotein genes.  newly designed primers targeting rbcl (co2 fixation), psba (photosystem ii) and rnpb (reference) genes were used in qrt-pcr assays to assess the photosynthetic capability of natural communities of prochlorococcus, the most abundant photosynthetic organism on earth and a major contributor to primary production in oligotrophic oceans.  here we show that the moderate low-light-adapted strain prochlorococcus sp.  picocyanobacteria such as synechococcus and prochlorococcus depend on chlorophyll a-binding protein complexes to capture light energy.  recent measurements of natural populations of the marine cyanobacterium prochlorococcus indicate this numerically dominant phototroph assimilates phosphorus (p) at significant rates in p-limited oceanic regions. ||| ",Yes
Have mutations in the Polycomb group been found in human diseases?,Yes,"Mutations in the Polycomb group have been identified in human diseases, particularly in cancer. The abnormal expression of Polycomb-group (PCG) proteins is closely associated with carcinogenesis and the clinicopathological features of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Mutations and deletions of Polycomb repressive complex (PRC) components are increasingly recognized to affect tumor biology in a range of cancers. Overexpression of PCG proteins is associated with poor prognoses in some types of cancers but with favorable prognoses in others. However, the genetic mutation profile of PCG genes has not been well established, and little is known about how genetic alterations of PRC-interacting molecules such as the core binding factor (CBF) complex influence Polycomb activity.","the polycomb group proteins have recently captured the attention of cancer biologists.  later, a group of diverse genes collectively called polycomb group (pcg) genes were identified based on common mutant phenotypes.  polycomb group genes (pcgs) are epigenetic effectors implicated in most cancer hallmarks.  polycomb group (pcg) proteins are conserved epigenetic regulators that are linked to cancer in humans.  although the abnormal expression of polycomb-group (pcg) proteins is closely associated with carcinogenesis and the clinicopathological features of hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc), the genetic mutation profile of pcg genes has not been well established.  more than 80 years ago, the first polycomb-related phenotype was identified in drosophila melanogaster.  the polycomb gene was discovered 60 years ago as a mutation inducing a particular homeotic phenotype.  mutations and deletions of polycomb repressive complex (prc) components are increasingly recognized to affect tumor biology in a range of cancers.  polycomb group (pcg) proteins, which are conserved from invertebrates to mammals, are associated with epigenetic regulation of many cell fates.  overexpression of polycomb group proteins is associated with poor prognoses in some types of cancers but with favorable prognoses in others.  subsequent work showed that polycomb is a general repressor of homeotic genes.  naturally occurring variations of polycomb repressive complex 1 (prc1) comprise a core assembly of polycomb group proteins and additional factors that include, surprisingly, autism susceptibility candidate 2 (auts2).  polycomb group proteins are epigenetic factors that silence gene expression; they are dysregulated in cancer cells and contribute to carcinogenesis by unclear mechanisms.  polycomb group proteins form multicomponent complexes that are important for establishing lineage-specific patterns of gene expression.  other genes with similar function were identified and named polycomb group (pcg) genes, while trithorax group (trxg) genes were shown to counteract pcg-mediated repression of homeotic genes.  mutations in several polycomb (pc) group genes cause maternal-effect or zygotic segmentation defects, suggesting that pc group genes may regulate the segmentation genes of drosophila.  our results provide evidence that cbfβ-smmhc markedly and diversely affects polycomb recruitment and transcriptional regulation across the aml genome.  however, little is known about how genetic alterations of prc-interacting molecules such as the core binding factor (cbf) complex influence polycomb activity.  some polyposis syndromes have been known for decades, but the development in genetic technologies has allowed the identification of new syndromes..  mammalian cells encode multiple permutations of the prototypic polycomb repressive complex 1 (prc1) with little evidence for functional specialization. ||| ",Yes
Can RNASeq be used for the analysis of nascent transcripts?,Yes,"RNA-Seq, a next-generation sequencing based method for transcriptome analysis, has been shown to be effective for the analysis of nascent transcripts. This is evident in its ability to detect post-cleavage RNA at termination sites and promoter-associated antisense RNAs, providing insights into RNA polymerase II dynamics and processivity. Furthermore, nascent RNA profiling, which often includes nonpolyadenylated RNAs, can unveil novel insights into transcriptional regulation. The use of RNA-Seq for the analysis of nascent transcripts is also supported by its ability to mirror real-time activity of RNA polymerases and provide an accurate readout of transcriptome-wide variations.","rna-seq is an approach to transcriptome profiling that uses deep-sequencing technologies to detect and accurately quantify rna molecules originating from a genome at a given moment in time.  rna-seq is a recently developed sequencing technology, that through the analysis of cdna allows for unique insights into the transcriptome of a cell.  rna sequencing, or (rna-seq for short,, is a widely applied technology that for extractings gene and transcript expression from biological samples.  qualitative and quantitative analysis of small non-coding rnas by next generation sequencing (smallrna-seq) represents a novel technology increasingly used to investigate with high sensitivity and specificity rna population comprising micrornas and other regulatory small transcripts.  rna-seq is revolutionizing the way we study transcriptomes.  rna sequencing (rna-seq) has become a powerful tool to understand molecular mechanisms and/or developmental programs.  however, the profiling of nascent transcripts, which often include nonpolyadenylated rnas, can unveil novel insights into transcriptional regulation.  genome-wide profiling of nascent rna has become a fundamental tool to study transcription regulation.  rna-seq, a next-generation sequencing based method for transcriptome analysis, is rapidly emerging as the method of choice for comprehensive transcript abundance estimation.  furthermore, nascent rna-seq detects post-cleavage rna at termination sites and promoter-associated antisense rnas, providing insights into rna polymerase ii (rnapii) dynamics and processivity.  recent advances in rna sequencing technology (rna-seq) enables comprehensive profiling of rnas by producing millions of short sequence reads from size-fractionated rna libraries.  however, it is unclear whether these state-of-the-art rna-seq analysis pipelines can quantify small rnas as accurately as they do with long rnas in the context of total rna quantification.  rna-seq, the application of next-generation sequencing to rna, provides transcriptome-wide characterization of cellular activity.  analysis of smallrna-seq data to gather biologically relevant information, i.e.  especially for non-model organisms and in absence of a reference genome, rna-seq data is used to reconstruct and quantify transcriptomes at the same time.  in summary, rna-seqc provides quality control measures critical to experiment design, process optimization and downstream computational analysis.  unlike steady-state rna-sequencing (rna-seq), nascent rna profiling mirrors real-time activity of rna polymerases and provides an accurate readout of transcriptome-wide variations.  here we present norahdesk, the first unbiased and universally applicable method for small ncrnas detection from rna-seq data.  rna-seqc allows investigators to make informed decisions about sample inclusion in downstream analysis.  the accuracy of rna-seq can be highly impacted by the purity of samples. ||| ",Yes
Is ocrelizumab effective for treatment of multiple sclerosis?,Yes,"Ocrelizumab, a humanized monoclonal anti-CD20 antibody, has been shown to have good clinical efficiency in the management of multiple sclerosis (MS) in pivotal clinical trials. The medication has been approved for the treatment of patients with relapsing MS (RMS) and primary progressive MS (PPMS) due to its pronounced effects in reducing disease activity and disability progression. Pivotal trials have demonstrated that patients with MS receiving ocrelizumab had better outcomes compared to those who did not receive the treatment. The medication has also been shown to be well tolerated and manageable in MS patients. Real-world evidence regarding the effectiveness and safety of ocrelizumab for the treatment of MS is limited, but studies have shown a significant reduction in annualized relapse rate, disability progression, and gadolinium-enhancing lesions on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in patients with relapsing-remitting MS who received ocrelizumab.","pivotal clinical trials revealed good clinical efficiency of ocrelizumab while having a good safety profile in the management of multiple sclerosis (ms).  ocrelizumab, a humanized monoclonal anti-cd20 antibody, has shown pronounced effects in reduction of disease activity in multiple sclerosis (ms) patients and has recently been approved for the treatment of patients with relapsing ms (rms) and primary progressive ms (ppms).  pivotal trials showed good clinical efficiency of the monoclonal antibody ocrelizumab while being well tolerated and manageable in multiple sclerosis (ms).  ocrelizumab is an anti-cd20 monoclonal antibody that has been shown to reduce disability progression in primary progressive multiple sclerosis (ms).  pivotal trial have shown that patients with multiple sclerosis (ms) receiving ocrelizumab had better outcomes.  ocrelizumab, an anti-cd20 humanized monoclonal antibody, reduced disease progression in pivotal trials of patients with relapsing (opera i, opera ii) and primary progressive (oratorio) multiple sclerosis (ms).  to review the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and safety of ocrelizumab, a new b-cell-targeted therapy for multiple sclerosis (ms).  the aim of this study was to evaluate the preliminary safety profile and effectiveness of ocrelizumab treatment for multiple sclerosis (ms) in a real-world clinical setting.  ocrelizumab is a humanized monoclonal anti-cd20 antibody approved for treatment of relapsing-remitting and primary progressive multiple sclerosis (ms).  ocrelizumab is a humanized monoclonal anti-cd20 antibody approved for treatment of relapsing-remitting and primary progressive multiple sclerosis (ms).  real-world evidence regarding the effectiveness and safety of ocrelizumab for the treatment of multiple sclerosis (ms) is limited.  the aim of our study was to provide effectiveness and safety data of ocrelizumab treatment in patients with relapsing-remitting (rr-) and progressive multiple sclerosis (pms) and to evaluate clinical and immunological predictors of early treatment response.  ocrelizumab is a monoclonal anti-cd20 antibody approved for the treatment of both relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (rrms) and primary progressive multiple sclerosis (ppms).  recently, ocrelizumab (ocrevus®) was approved for the treatment of primary progressive multiple sclerosis (ppms) based on data from the oratorio clinical trial.  ocrelizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that selectively targets cd20-positive b cells and is indicated for treatment of patients with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (rms) or primary progressive multiple sclerosis (ppms).  the chords trial evaluated ocrelizumab (ocr) in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis who had a suboptimal response to previous disease-modifying treatment.  two phase iii trials evaluated the efficacy of ocrelizumab in patients with relapsing remitting ms, and individual and pooled analysis demonstrated a significant reduction in annualized relapse rate ( p < 0.001 pooled), disability progression at 12 weeks ( p < 0.001 pooled), and gadolinium-enhancing lesions on magnetic resonance imaging (mri; p < 0.001).  rituximab and ocrelizumab are anti-cd20 monoclonal antibodies that have shown a marked reduction in multiple sclerosis (ms) inflammatory activity.  ocrelizumab is an anti-cd20 monoclonal antibody for the treatment of multiple sclerosis (ms) that is closely related to rituximab.  in this post hoc exploratory analysis, we evaluated the efficacy of ocrelizumab on disability progression among a subgroup of patients with ms who had increased baseline disability levels (expanded disability status scale scores ≥4.0) in the pivotal trials. ||| ",Yes
Can valproic acid prolong survival of glioblastoma patients?,Yes,"The context provided suggests that valproic acid (VPA) has been associated with improved outcomes in glioblastoma patients. VPA is an antiepileptic drug with histone deacetylase inhibitor activity, which has been shown to enhance overall survival and progression-free survival in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma. Several retrospective studies and clinical trials have reported an association between VPA use and improved survival outcomes in patients with glioblastoma. Additionally, VPA has been found to have antitumor effects on gliomas and can inhibit the growth of cancer cells. The results of one study suggest that glioblastoma patients may experience prolonged survival due to VPA administration, and chronic treatment with VPA may protect neuronal cells from damage caused by oxidative stress. Therefore, it can be concluded that VPA may prolong survival in glioblastoma patients.","retrospective evidence suggests that valproic acid (vpa), an antiepileptic drug, is associated with improved outcomes in glioblastoma.  valproic acid (vpa) has been recently investigated for its anticancer properties in different tumors, including malignant gliomas.  valproic acid (vpa) is an antiepileptic agent with histone deacetylase inhibitor activity shown to enhance overall survival and progression free survival in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma (gbm).  valproic acid (vpa) is a histone deacetylase inhibitor that apart from its anticonvulsive effects in some retrospective studies has been suggested to lead to a superior outcome of glioblastoma patients.  several uncontrolled retrospective case series and a post hoc analysis of the registration trial for temozolomide indicated an association between valproic acid (vpa) use and improved survival outcomes in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma.  valproic acid (vpa), a widely used antiepileptic drug, has been found to have antitumor effects on gliomas, but its role still has not been determined.  several clinical studies have reported that valproic acid could prolong survival of gbm patients.  valproic acid (va) is an antiepileptic drug (aed) and histone deacetylase (hdac) inhibitor taken by patients with glioblastoma (gb) to manage seizures, and it can modulate the biologic effects of radiation therapy (rt).  to examine the efficacy of valproic acid (vpa) given either with or without levetiracetam (lev) on seizure control and on survival in patients with glioblastoma multiforme (gbm) treated with chemoradiation.  valproic acid (vpa), an anticonvulsant and mood-stabilizing drug is used to treat epileptic seizure of glioblastoma patients.  literature data support evidences that glioblastoma (gbm) patients experience prolonged survival due to sodium valproate (navp) treatment.  valproic acid (vpa), one of the most common histone deacetylase inhibitors (hdacis), has been detected to directly or synergistically exert inhibitory effects on glioma in vitro and in vivo.  valproic acid (vpa), a histone deacetylase (hdac) inhibitor, is also used to manage seizures in glioblastoma patients.  in addition to its anticonvulsant and mood stabilizing properties, valproic acid can also inhibit the growth of cancer cells.  we have reported that valproic acid upregulates melatonin mt1 receptor expression in rat c6 glioma cells.  valproic acid, a histone deacetylase inhibitor, has beneficial effects in the setting of cancer, neurologic diseases, and traumatic injuries.  the results of our study suggest that glioblastoma patients may experience prolonged survival due to vpa administration.  our results suggest that chronic treatment with valproate may protect neuronal cells from damage caused by oxidative stress and that neuroprotection from oxidative damages may be involved in the mechanism of action of valproate.  prolonged treatment with adjuvant valganciclovir has been shown in one retrospective study to exert a significant effect on overall survival (os) in newly diagnosed patients with glioblastoma multiforme (gbm).  the purpose of this study was to determine if valproate provides a neuroprotective effect against damage caused by oxidative stress in primary cultured rat cerebral cortical cells. ||| ",Yes
Can clonidine be used to reduce agitation in children.,Yes,"Justification: The context indicates that clonidine has been shown to be effective in reducing the risk of postsevoflurane agitation in children, with a significant decrease in the incidence of agitation and severe agitation in the clonidine group compared to the placebo group. The use of clonidine for this purpose has been studied in various populations of children, including those with ADHD and comorbid tic disorders. Additionally, clonidine has been shown to have analgesic and sedative properties, which may contribute to its effectiveness in reducing agitation. However, the impact of clonidine on postoperative sedation is not well-quantified, and further research is needed to fully understand its effects.","clonidine produces a substantial reduction in the risk of postsevoflurane agitation in children.  on the basis of our results, clonidine might be used to safely prevent postoperative agitation in boys anaesthetised with sevoflurane.  clonidine is effective in treating sevoflurane-induced postanesthesia agitation in children.  this report provides further support of a role for clonidine in the treatment of children with adhd, particularly for those with comorbid tic disorders.  pain and discomfort scores were significantly decreased in the clonidine group; the incidence of agitation was reduced by 57% (p = 0.029) and the incidence of severe agitation by 67% (p = 0.064).  clonidine could not prevent agitation (incidence 54%, 13/24).  we conclude that clonidine is a useful adjunct for controlled hypotension in children.  30 (20%) of 150 boys in the clonidine group were agitated compared with 69 (47%) of 147 boys in the placebo group (0·43, 0·30-0·61; p<0·0001).  we aimed to assess the effects of intravenous clonidine administered intraoperatively on the incidence of postoperative agitation, pain, and adverse events.  we conducted a study on 169 children to quantify the risk reduction of clonidine agitation in patients admitted to our day-surgery pediatric clinic.  clonidine is widely used off-label in children for several indications, including pa, but the current level of evidence is limited.  to examine the efficacy of clonidine in this population of children, the use of clonidine in the treatment of children with adhd with and without comorbid tic disorders was examined in a retrospective chart review of 54 children over a 4-year period.  in the present study, we evaluated if tropisetron or clonidine could reduce the incidence of postoperative agitation after day case adenoidectomy in small children.  clonidine is used for analgesia and sedation in paediatric anaesthesia, but there are no data on its sedative properties and side effects in critically ill children.  clonidine has been suggested as an alternative pharmacotherapy for patients with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (adhd) and comorbid tic disorders.  clonidine is used increasingly in pediatric anesthesia practice to prolong the duration of action of caudal block with a local anesthetic agent.  these data suggest that oral clonidine premedication (4 micrograms/kg) is a possible approach to facilitating postoperative analgesia in children undergoing minor surgery.  clonidine may be used intraoperatively to decrease emergence delirium in children, but the drug's impact on postoperative sedation is poorly quantified.  clonidine, which is known to have analgesic and sedative properties, has recently been shown to be an effective preanesthetic medication in children.  clonidine is an effective preanesthetic medication in children, providing a preoperative sedative effect. ||| ",Yes
Is the protein pelota a ribosomal rescue factor?,No,"The context does not provide information on the protein pelota. However, it does mention the ribosome-recycling factor (rrf) and elongation factor g (ef-g) as factors involved in the recycling of psrp1/py from the ribosome. The context also mentions the initiation factor 5a (a/eif-5a) and the homologous protein ef-p as factors that rescue ribosomes stalled on polyproline-containing sequences. Therefore, based on the context, it cannot be concluded that the protein pelota is a ribosomal rescue factor.","here we demonstrate that psrp1 is not a bona fide ribosomal protein, but rather a functional homologue of the escherichia coli cold-shock protein py.  these results suggest a novel function for ef-g and rrf in the post-stress return of psrp1/py-inactivated ribosomes to the actively translating pool.  ribosomal protein p0 is one of the highly conserved phosphorylated proteins in the large subunit of eukaryotic ribosomes.  furthermore, similarly to trnas, psrp1/py is recycled from the ribosome by the concerted action of the ribosome-recycling factor (rrf) and elongation factor g (ef-g).  rps27l (ribosomal protein s27-like) is an evolutionarily conserved ribosomal protein and a direct p53 target.  ribosomal phosphoprotein p1 (rpp1) is acidic phosphoprotein which in association with neutral phosphoprotein p0 and acidic phosphoprotein p2 forms ribosomal p protein complex as (p1)2-p0-(p2)2.  during protein synthesis, ribosomes become stalled on polyproline-containing sequences, unless they are rescued in archaea and eukaryotes by the initiation factor 5a (a/eif-5a) and in bacteria by the homologous protein ef-p.  the ribosomal phosphoprotein p0 of the human malarial parasite plasmodium falciparum (pfp0) has been identified as a protective surface protein.  ribosomal protein p0 forms a pentameric complex with two heterodimers of the flexible stalk proteins p1•p2 and plays a role in the functional interaction of eukaryotic ribosomes with translational factors.  ribonuclease p (rnase p) is a ribonucleoprotein comprised of a catalytic rna subunit and one or several protein subunits.  we also report that p97 binds eif2beta through its c-terminal domain and localizes to ribosome through its n-terminal mif4g domain.  psrp1 induces conformational changes within ribosomal components that comprise several intersubunit bridges, including bridge b2a, thereby stabilizes the ribosome against dissociation.  these findings would support a model whereby eif-5a stimulates peptide bond formation on polyproline-stalled ribosomes by stabilizing and orienting the cca-end of the p-trna, rather than by directly contributing to the catalysis.  we propose that par14 is a component of the pre-rrna complexes and functions as an rrna processing factor in ribosome biogenesis.  the ribosomal function of p0 is mediated at the stalk of the large ribosomal subunit at the gtpase centre, where the elongation factor eef2 binds.  three-dimensional cryo-electron microscopic (cryo-em) reconstructions reveal that, like py, psrp1 binds within the intersubunit space of the 70s ribosome, at a site overlapping the positions of mrna and a- and p-site trnas.  this chaperonin is implicated in the folding and assembly of the enzyme ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase and in the folding of proteins imported into plastids from the cytosol.  we find that the presence of psrp1/py lowers the binding of trna to the ribosome.  we give evidence that, although par14 exists in both the phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms in the cell, only the latter form is associated with the pre-40 s and pre-60 s ribosomal complexes.  we recently reported that rps27l disruption triggers ribosomal stress to induce p53, causing postnatal death, which can be rescued by trp53 +/- . ||| ",Yes
Are there transposon-free regions in mammalian genomes?,No,"The context indicates that mammalian genomes are comprised of 30-50% transposed elements (TES), with transposable elements (TES) found within most genes. The only presently spreading class of human transposable elements comprises non-LTR (long terminal repeat) retrotransposons, which cover approximately 5-6% of mammalian genomes. The vast majority of these TES are truncated and mutated fragments of retrotransposons that are no longer capable of transposition. The context does not mention any transposon-free regions in mammalian genomes.","four mechanisms are presented which may explain the nonrandom genomic distribution of mammalian transposons: i) sequence-specific insertion, ii) s-phase insertion, iii) ectopic excision, and iv) recombinational editing.  all mammalian transposable elements characterized to date appear to be nonrandomly distributed in the mammalian genome.  mammalian genomes are littered with enormous numbers of transposable elements interspersed within and between single-copy endogenous genes.  our results are consistent with the hypothesis that transposon rnas frequently originate within genomic te units and do not primarily accumulate as a consequence of random 'read-through' from gene promoters.  mammalian genomes are comprised of 30-50% transposed elements (tes).  comprising nearly half of the human and mouse genomes, transposable elements (tes) are found within most genes.  although many of these elements are defective, a number of mammalian non-ltr retrotransposons of the l1 type are capable of autonomous retrotransposition.  mammalian genomes contain hundreds of thousands of non-ltr retrotransposon copies, mostly resulting from the amplification of a single clade known as l1.  mammalian genomes are repositories of repetitive dna sequences derived from transposable elements (tes).  to characterize the contribution of transposons to mammalian transcriptomes, we developed a custom microarray platform with probes covering known human and mouse transposons in both sense and antisense orientations.  mammalian genomes contain highly conserved sequences that are not functionally transcribed.  transposable elements (tes) are mobile genetic elements that make up a large fraction of mammalian genomes.  the only presently spreading class of human transposable elements comprises non-ltr (long terminal repeat) retrotransposons, which cover approx.  only 5-6% of mammalian genomes are genes; the remainders are made up primarily of transposable elements and different types of simple sequence repeat (ssrs) (micro- and minisatellites and cryptic repeats), which tend to accumulate in organisms with larger genomes.  the vast majority of these tes are truncated and mutated fragments of retrotransposons that are no longer capable of transposition.  recent insertions of ltr-retrotransposons, non-ltr retrotransposons, and non-autonomous retrotransposons have caused disease frequently in mice, but infrequently in humans.  the long interspersed nuclear element (line-1) (l1) clade of non-ltr retrotransposons has been particularly successful in mammals, accounting for 30-40% of human genome sequence.  the genomes of teleost fish and squamate reptiles contain a much more diverse array of non-ltr retrotransposon families, whereas copy number is relatively low.  although transposable element (te) derived dna accounts for more than half of mammalian genomes and initiates a significant proportion of rna transcripts, high throughput methods are rarely leveraged specifically to detect expression from interspersed repeats.  more than half the human and mouse genomes are comprised of repetitive sequences, such as transposable elements (tes), which have been implicated in many biological processes. ||| ",Yes
Is there a disease or condition called Exploding Head Syndrome?,Yes,"Exploding Head Syndrome (EHS) is a recognized condition characterized by the perception of abrupt, loud noises or a sense of explosion in the head during sleep-wake or wake-sleep transitions. It is classified as a benign sensory parasomnia. Despite earlier beliefs, EHS is relatively common, particularly in younger individuals. The episodes can be accompanied by significant fear and distress, and in some cases, can lead to clinically significant impairment. The exact cause of EHS is not fully understood, with several etiological theories proposed. The condition has received limited empirical and clinical attention, and prevalence rates are not well-established. However, a study of undergraduate students found that 18.00% experienced lifetime EHS, with 16.60% experiencing recurrent cases. Although the episodes themselves are relatively harmless, EHS can be a frightening phenomenon with potential clinical consequences.","exploding head syndrome is characterized by the perception of abrupt, loud noises when going to sleep or waking up.  exploding head syndrome (ehs) is a benign sensory parasomnia characterized by the perception of loud noises or a sense of explosion in the head.  exploding head syndrome is characterized by the perception of loud noises during sleep-wake or wake-sleep transitions.  exploding head syndrome (ehs) is characterized by attacks of a sudden noise or explosive feeling experienced in the head occurring during the transition from wake to sleep or from sleep to wake.  background exploding head syndrome (ehs) is characterized by loud noises or a sense of explosion in the head during sleep transitions.  contrary to some earlier theorizing, exploding head syndrome was found to be a relatively common experience in younger individuals.  exploding head syndrome episodes were accompanied by clinically significant levels of fear, and a minority (2.80%) experienced it to such a degree that it was associated with clinically significant distress and/or impairment.  after first discussing the history, prevalence, and associated features, the available polysomnography data and five main etiological theories for exploding head syndrome are summarized.  at present there are little systematic data on exploding head syndrome, and prevalence rates are unknown.  in order to test these hypotheses, 211 undergraduate students were assessed for both exploding head syndrome and isolated sleep paralysis using semi-structured diagnostic interviews: 18.00% of the sample experienced lifetime exploding head syndrome, this reduced to 16.60% for recurrent cases.  in spite of the fact that its characteristic symptomatology was first described approximately 150 y ago, exploding head syndrome has received relatively little empirical and clinical attention.  the term post-head-trauma syndrome is used to denote a group of symptoms following head trauma.  background headache attributed to head injury is claimed to be among the most common secondary headache disorders, yet available epidemiological evidence is scarce.  we present six new cases extending the clinical experience with the syndrome.  next, the various methods used to assess and treat exploding head syndrome are discussed, as well as the limited outcome data.  it would seem that these cases can be related to some degree of cerebral venous outflow obstruction.  headache can be a symptom of vast pathologies, and common secondary headache including head or neck trauma, cranial or cervical vascular disorder, non-vascular intracranial disorders headache related to a substance or its withdrawals, infection, disorders of homeostasis, disorders of cranium or facial mouth or cranial disorders, and headache attributable to psychiatric.  although episodes by themselves are relatively harmless, it is a frightening phenomenon that may result in clinical consequences.  headache can also be the sole or predominant clinical manifestation of epileptic seizures, although this is a relatively rare condition.  recently, the term ictal epileptic headache has been proposed in cases in which headache is the sole ictal epileptic manifestation diagnosis requires the simultaneous onset of headache with eeg-demonstrated ictal discharges. ||| ",Yes
Is there a genome-wide technique for the detection of R-loop formation?,Yes,"The context describes several genome-wide techniques for the detection of R-loop formation. These include the MAPR (Mung Bean Nuclease Assisted Photo-crosslinking and RNase Protection) method, which is a highly sensitive and antibody-independent technique for profiling native R-loops genome-wide. Additionally, the R-ChIP (R-loop Chromatin Immunoprecipitation) strategy is mentioned as a robust method for capturing R-loops genome-wide. Furthermore, the context discusses the use of DRIP-seq (DNA:RNA Immunoprecipitation sequencing) techniques for mapping R-loops genome-wide, providing insights into R-loop biology. These methods have been used to identify R-loop peaks in the maize genome and to generate a comprehensive atlas of R-loop patterns in Arabidopsis.","current models suggest that uncontrolled r-loops are a hazard to genome integrity, therefore, identifying proteins that are involved in recognising and signalling r-loop structures are of key importance.  here, we describe a new, highly sensitive, and antibody-independent method, mapr, to profile native r-loops genome wide.  here, we provide a detailed protocol for a newly developed strategy, named r-chip, for robust capture of r-loops genome-wide.  although recent studies have revealed the genome-wide distribution of r-loops, our understanding of r-loop formation is still limited.  here, we conducted a genome-wide identification of r-loops and identified more than 700,000 r-loop peaks in the maize (zea mays) genome.  understanding the parameters dictating r-loop formation in vivo has been hampered by the limited quantitative and spatial resolution of current genomic strategies for mapping r loops.  devising methods to identify the precise genomic locations of r-loops is critical to understand how these structures regulate numerous cellular processes, including replication, termination, and chromosome segregation, and how their unscheduled formation results in disease.  here, using our recently developed genome-wide r-loop profiling method, we generated a comprehensive atlas quantifying the r-loop patterns of arabidopsis (arabidopsis thaliana) in 53 samples during development and during responses to environmental stimuli.  we review the current knowledge of the mechanisms controlling r loops and their putative relationship with disease.  understanding the genomic distribution and function of r-loops is an important goal, since r-loops have been implicated in a number of adaptive and maladaptive processes under physiological and pathological conditions.  here, we analyse published dna:rna-hybrid sequencing to elucidate the features that determine dsb-induced r-loop formation.  recently, evidence has emerged that r loops occur more often in the genome and have greater physiological relevance, including roles in transcription and chromatin structure, than was previously predicted.  our findings thus provide a direct demonstration that r-loop formation impairs dna replication and that this is responsible for the deleterious effects of r loops on genome stability from bacteria to humans.  thus, the hybrid map generated by s1-drip-seq led to the identification of the first global genomic features causal for r-loop formation in yeast.  to enable precision analysis of r-loops in vivo, we develop an rnase-h-based approach; this reveals predominant r-loop formation near gene promoters with strong g/c skew and propensity to form g-quadruplex in non-template dna, corroborating with all biochemically established properties of r-loops.  r-loop, a three-stranded rna/dna structure, has been linked to induced genome instability and regulated gene expression.  r-loops are a common chromatin feature with essential functions in multiple cellular processes and diseases.  r-loop represents a prevalent and specialized chromatin structure critically involved in a wide range of biological processes.  drip (dna:rna immunoprecipitation)-seq techniques are widely used to map r-loops genome-wide providing insights into r-loop biology.  more importantly, we then show that r-loop formation causes dna replication fork stalling, and that this in fact underlies the effects of r loops on genomic stability. ||| ",Yes
Is there increased incidence of incontinence in athletes?,Yes,"Justification: Current evidence indicates a high prevalence of urinary incontinence among female athletes, with rates as high as 34.15% among high school athletes. This prevalence is significantly higher than in control subjects (p = .001). The more seasons athletes engage in vigorous exercise, the higher the rate of incontinence. Research has also demonstrated that young female athletes participating in high-impact sports may be at higher risk for urinary incontinence. Factors such as type of sport, duration and intensity of athletic activity, use of hormonal contraception, and weight have been identified as contributing factors.","current evidence points to a high prevalence of urinary incontinence among female athletes.  there is an even higher rate of athletic incontinence (34.15%) among high school female athletes surveyed in this study than in previous studies of college age athletes.  urinary incontinence prevalence was 28% for athletes and 9.8% for control subjects (p = .001).  there is a very high prevalence of urinary incontinence in women athletes.  the more seasons athletes are engaged in vigorous exercise, the higher the rate of incontinence in athletics as well as during laughter and activities of daily living (adls).  therefore, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the prevalence of urinary incontinence in female young athletes.  athletic incontinence is common among adolescent female athletes.  looking at the different sports activities, a higher rate of incontinence was found in women participating in basketball (16.6%), athletics (15%), and tennis or squash (11%).  to evaluate the prevalence of urinary incontinence (ui) in female athletes practising high-impact sports and its association with knowledge, attitude and practice (kap).  a collection of studies have demonstrated that approximately one-third of female nulliparous athletes experience urinary incontinence during their athletic activities.  incontinent athletes demonstrated a relative risk of 2.7 to develop sexual desire problem when compared to the continents (p = 0.04; 95% cis: 1.50-4.89).  the present authors observed a relationship between the sport and the pelvic floor dysfunction, in particular urinary incontinence.  research has demonstrated that young female athletes participating in high-impact sports may be at higher risk for urinary incontinence.  to determine the prevalence of urinary incontinence (ui) among elite athletes and to compare prevalences between sexes and across different sports modalities.  eating disorders also increase the risk of urinary incontinence in athletes.  stress urinary incontinence is common during physical activity.  in a total of 105 athletes, the present authors observed that 65.7% had reported at least one symptom of stress urinary incontinence (sui) and/or urgency, during sport or in daily life situations.  the purpose of this pilot study was to describe the urinary habits and frequency of incontinence among adolescent female athletes.  contributing factors of incontinence that have thus far been the focus of study include type of sport, duration and intensity of athletic activity, use of hormonal contraception, and weight.  a high number of female athletes suffer from pfd, especially urinary incontinence. ||| ",Yes
Is there a role of regorafenib for sarcoma treatment?,Yes,"The evidence suggests that regorafenib, a multikinase inhibitor, has a role in the treatment of sarcoma. The placebo-controlled phase-2 regosarc trial demonstrated the efficacy of regorafenib in patients with leiomyosarcoma, synovial sarcoma, and other non-adipocytic sarcomas. Furthermore, the sarc024 phase II clinical trial investigated the use of regorafenib in specific sarcoma subtypes, including advanced osteosarcoma. The study met its primary endpoint, demonstrating the activity of regorafenib in patients with progressive metastatic osteosarcoma. Therefore, regorafenib should be considered a treatment option for patients with relapsed metastatic osteosarcoma.","we hypothesized that regorafenib would improve progression-free survival (pfs) in patients with sarcoma and report the results of the osteosarcoma cohort.  the multikinase inhibitor regorafenib is utilized for the treatment of malignancy.  observed pfs confirms that regorafenib warrants further clinical investigation in refractory non-adipocytic sarcomas.  the oral multi-target kinase inhibitor regorafenib, which targets the oncogenic receptor tyrosine kinase (rtk), is an effective therapeutic for patients with advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumors or metastatic colorectal cancer.  the placebo-controlled phase-2 regosarc trial demonstrated the efficacy of regorafenib in patients with leiomyosarcoma, synovial sarcoma and other non-adipocytic sarcoma but not in liposarcoma.  sarc024 is a phase ii clinical trial of the multikinase inhibitor regorafenib in specific sarcoma subtypes, including advanced osteosarcoma.  recently, several clinical trials have revealed that regorafenib has an anti-tumor activity in gastric cancer.  regorafenib is an oral multikinase inhibitor and is approved as salvage therapy in the standard treatment of advanced colorectal cancer (crc).  regorafenib, a multikinase inhibitor targeting the ras/raf/mek/erk pathway, has recently been approved for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer.  we found that regorafenib inhibited cell proliferation and invasion at the concentration of 20μmol/l and in a dose dependent manner.  regorafenib should be considered a treatment option for patients with relapsed metastatic osteosarcoma.  regorafenib is a multikinase inhibitor with antiangiogenic effects that improves overall survival (os) in metastatic colorectal cancer (mcrc) after failure of standard therapies.  the study met its primary end point, demonstrating activity of regorafenib in patients with progressive metastatic osteosarcoma.  regorafenib is an oral multikinase inhibitor for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer (mcrc).  this review summarizes the anti-tumor effects of regorafenib in single or combined treatment in preclinical models of hcc, crc and gists and discusses both the global and molecular effects that account for its anti-cancer properties in the clinical setting.  regorafenib is an oral small-molecule multi kinase inhibitor.  we investigated the efficacy and safety of regorafenib in antiangiogenic therapy-naïve chemotherapy-refractory advanced colorectal cancer.  we investigated how regorafenib suppresses colorectal cancer cell growth and potentiates effects of other chemotherapeutic drugs.  the anti-tumor effects of regorafenib on gastric cancer cells were analyzed via cell proliferation and invasion.  in snu-16 mice xenografts, regorafenib significantly inhibited tumor growth, proliferation, and fgfr signaling compared to treatment with control vehicle. ||| ",Yes
is pharmacological treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism effective in reducing cardiovascular events?,Yes,"The context suggests that subclinical hypothyroidism is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, including dyslipidemia, hypertension, atherosclerosis, and coronary artery disease. The findings indicate that subclinical hypothyroidism affects diastolic function, and this abnormality may be reversed by L-T4 substitutive therapy. The study also demonstrates that patients with subclinical hypothyroidism have increased levels of triglycerides and signs of low-grade inflammation, which may be a risk factor for the development of cardiovascular disease in younger males. Therefore, early identification and treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism may have a beneficial impact on overall health and reduce the risk of cardiovascular events.","previous studies suggested that subclinical hypothyroidism has a detrimental effect on cardiovascular risk factors, and that its effective treatment may have a beneficial impact on overall health.  the purpose of the present study was to examine a possible association between subclinical hypothyroidism and cardiovascular disease.  the role of subclinical hypothyroidism as risk factor for cardiovascular diseases is supported by recent meta-analysis.  the main purpose of this review and meta-analysis was to assess whether subclinical hypothyroidism treatment is of clinical relevance, based on cardiovascular risk parameters correction.  because the cardiovascular system is considered a main target for the action of thyroid hormone, we investigated whether subclinical hypothyroidism induces cardiovascular abnormalities.  subclinical hypothyroidism was a predictor of cardiovascular disease in males below 50 years with an odds ratio of 3.4 (95% confidence interval 1.6-6.8) for developing cardiovascular disease compared to euthyroid age-matched males.  early identification of patients with sub-clinical hypothyroidism may lead to early treatment and thereby favourable effect on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.  subclinical hypothyroidism has been associated with dyslipidemia, hypertension, and increased risk of coronary artery disease.  adverse cardiovascular effect of hypothyroidism has been identified in many studies.  subclinical hypothyroidism was present in 10.8% of participants and was associated with a greater age-adjusted prevalence of aortic atherosclerosis (odds ratio, 1.7 ) and myocardial infarction (odds ratio, 2.3 ).  subclinical hypothyroidism is associated with dyslipidemia and atherosclerosis.  the cardiovascular risk is increased in patients with overt hypothyroidism, and several potential cardiovascular risk factors were similarly reported in patients with subclinical hypothyroidism.  subclinical hypothyroidism has been associated with elevated cholesterol and increased risk for atherosclerosis, but data on the risk of coronary heart disease (chd) are conflicting.  these findings indicate that subclinical hypothyroidism affects diastolic function and that this abnormality may be reversed by l-t4 substitutive therapy.  subclinical hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism have been associated with cardiac dysfunction.  below 50 years of age cardiovascular disease was more frequent in males with subclinical hypothyroidism compared to euthyroid males.  our study demonstrates that patients with subclinical hypothyroidism have increased levels of triglycerides and signs of low-grade inflammation (raised c-reactive protein levels) and that subclinical hypothyroidism might be a risk factor for development of cardiovascular disease in younger males.  whether subclinical hypothyroidism and thyroid autoimmunity are also risk factors for cardiovascular disease is controversial.  subclinical hypothyroidism is a strong indicator of risk for atherosclerosis and myocardial infarction in elderly women.  overt hypothyroidism has been found to be associated with cardiovascular disease. ||| ",No
Is the abnormal dosage of ultraconserved elements disfavored in cancer cells?,No,"The context provided does not offer direct evidence regarding the abnormal dosage of ultraconserved elements in cancer cells. However, it does discuss the role of chromosome instability (CIN) and aneuploidy in cancer, which are related to genomic instability and imbalanced chromosomal content. The context suggests that CIN and aneuploidy may contribute to cancer cell heterogeneity, drug resistance, and evasion of oncogene addiction. It also mentions that cells with abnormal karyotypes may generate a signal for their own elimination, possibly serving as a means for cancer cell immunosurveillance. Nevertheless, the context does not provide sufficient information to conclude whether the abnormal dosage of ultraconserved elements is disfavored in cancer cells.","oxidative damage to dna appears to be a factor in cancer, yet explanations for why highly elevated levels of such lesions do not always result in cancer remain elusive.  during the early stages of the multistep process of tumorigenesis, incipient cancer cells probably have adopted genetic and epigenetic alterations to tolerate the lethal mutations of other genes that ensue, and to a larger extent cin.  given the potential of cells with abnormal karyotypes to become cancerous, do pathways that limit the prevalence of such cells exist?  but are these changes merely a small piece of the oncogenesis puzzle or could they be the major component, or even sufficient for cancer?  cancer-specific, epigenetically-based changes in gene expression caused by abnormalities in dna methylation, in histone modifications, and in nucleosome positioning are gaining recognition as driving events in tumorigenesis.  additionally, the presence of short dysfunctional telomeres in cells can also cause these cells to become sensitive to mutagens, and particularly to radiation exposure.  we propose that cells with abnormal karyotypes generate a signal for their own elimination that may serve as a means for cancer cell immunosurveillance.  mutations that cause chromosome instability (cin) in cancer cells produce ""sublethal"" deficiencies in an essential process (chromosome segregation) and, therefore, may represent a major untapped resource that could be exploited for therapeutic benefit in the treatment of cancer.  telomere function may well be involved in cellular and organism responses to ionizing radiation.  unrestrained tumor growth can be associated with incidental errors in the genome during replication and genotoxic agents can alter the structure and sequence of our dna.  genomic instability is often considered a hallmark of cancer.  despite its ubiquity in cancer, link with other pathologies, and role in promoting adaptive evolution, the effects of aneuploidy or imbalanced chromosomal content on cellular physiology have remained incompletely characterized.  accordingly, interfering with tumor lethality suppression could lead to cancer cell death or growth defects.  fluctuating hypoxia, as an important and neglected factor, has been confirmed to induce malignant progression, confer to therapeutic resistance and exist extensively.  we wonder if most cancer stem cells (cscs) survive and are maintained in the region of fluctuating hypoxia, which protects them against differentiation.  finally, we propose a novel hypothesis to explain the hitherto enigmatic abundance compensation of proteins encoded on supernumerary chromosomes.  paradoxically, cancer cells, especially in solid tumors, contain somatic gene mutations and are chromosome instability (cin), suggesting a mechanism that cancer cells have acquired to suppress the lethal mutations and/or cin.  aneuploidy, a state of karyotype imbalance, is a hallmark of cancer.  in turn, cin mediated massive gain and loss of genes provides a wider buffer for further genetic reshuffling, resulting in cancer cell heterogeneity, drug resistance and evasion of oncogene addiction, thus cin may be both the effector and inducer of tumorigenesis.  cer1 - our main focus - contains multiple genes that may inhibit tumor growth, but 3 genes, ris1, lf (ltf) and limd1 have already the necessary experimental support to be considered bona fide tumor suppressors. ||| ",No
Is there an association between Muenke Syndrome and FGFR3 gene mutation?,Yes,"Muenke Syndrome is indeed associated with a mutation in the FGFR3 gene. This autosomal dominant disorder is characterized by coronal suture craniosynostosis, hearing loss, and various bony anomalies. The defining mutation is a heterozygous nucleotide transversion, c.749c>g, in the FGFR3 gene, which results in the amino acid substitution pro250arg. This mutation increases ligand-dependent signalling and is the most common genetic cause of craniosynostosis in humans. The association between Muenke Syndrome and the FGFR3 gene mutation has been further elucidated through the study of a genetically equivalent mouse model.","muenke syndrome is an autosomal dominant craniosynostosis syndrome resulting from a defining point mutation in the fibroblast growth factor receptor3 (fgfr3) gene.  muenke is a fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (fgfr-3)-associated syndrome, which was first described in late 1990 s. muenke syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized mainly by coronal suture craniosynostosis, hearing impairment and intellectual disability.  muenke syndrome is a craniosynostosis syndrome associated with the p.pro250arg mutation in fgfr3.  muenke syndrome is characterized by various craniofacial deformities and is caused by an autosomal-dominant activating mutation in fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (fgfr3(p250r)               ).  muenke syndrome caused by the fgfr3 pro250arg mutation is associated with craniosynostosis, hearing loss, and various bony anomalies.  to better understand the pathophysiology of the muenke syndrome, we present collective findings from several recent studies that have characterized a genetically equivalent mouse model for muenke syndrome (fgfr3 (p244r)) and compare them with human phenotypes.  muenke syndrome caused by the fgfr3(p250r) mutation is an autosomal dominant disorder mostly identified with coronal suture synostosis, but it also presents with other craniofacial phenotypes that include mild to moderate midface hypoplasia.  muenke syndrome, also known as fgfr3-associated coronal synostosis, is defined molecularly by the presence of a heterozygous nucleotide transversion, c.749c>g, encoding the amino acid substitution pro250arg, in the fibroblast growth factor receptor type 3 gene (fgfr3).  the heterozygous pro250arg substitution mutation in fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (fgfr3), which increases ligand-dependent signalling, is the most common genetic cause of craniosynostosis in humans and defines muenke syndrome.  this familial case illustrates the variable expressivity of muenke syndrome in association with an identical gene mutation.  muenke syndrome, defined by heterozygosity for a pro250arg substitution in fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (fgfr3), is the most common genetic cause of craniosynostosis in humans.  the muenke syndrome (ms) is characterized by unicoronal or bicoronal craniosynostosis, midfacial hypoplasia, ocular hypertelorism, and a variety of minor abnormalities associated with a mutation in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (fgfr3) gene.  sixteen individuals from 5 danish families with muenke syndrome are presented.  muenke syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by coronal suture craniosynostosis, hearing loss, developmental delay, carpal and tarsal fusions, and the presence of the pro250arg mutation in the fgfr3 gene.  in this case report, we focus on muenke syndrome (ms), a disease caused by the p.pro250arg variant in fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (fgfr3) and characterized by uni- or bilateral coronal suture synostosis, macrocephaly without craniosynostosis, dysmorphic craniofacial features, and dental malocclusion.  temporal lobe abnormalities and focal epilepsy have been documented in fgfr3-related clinical condition, including hypochondroplasia and muenke syndrome.  muenke syndrome (mim #602849), the most common syndromic craniosynostosis, results from the recurrent pathogenic p.p250r variant in fgfr3.  therefore, the fgfr3 (p244r) mouse provides an excellent opportunity to study disease mechanisms of some classical phenotypes of muenke syndrome and to test novel therapeutic strategies.  we have used gene targeting to introduce the muenke syndrome mutation (equivalent to p244r) into the murine fgfr3 gene.  the muenke syndrome mutation (fgfr3 (p250r)), which was discovered 15 years ago, represents the single most common craniosynostosis mutation. ||| ",Yes
Is Fibroblast Growth Factor 23 a phosphaturic hormone?,Yes,"Fibroblast Growth Factor 23 (FGF-23) is indeed a phosphaturic hormone.

Its primary role is to regulate phosphate and vitamin D metabolism. FGF-23 acts as a phosphaturic factor in the kidneys, promoting the excretion of phosphate in urine, thereby maintaining phosphate homeostasis in the body. It also regulates the levels of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, a form of active vitamin D, by inhibiting its production. The discovery of FGF-23 has provided new insights into the pathogenesis of various phosphate wasting disorders and secondary hyperparathyroidism.","fibroblast growth factor (fgf-23) is a novel phosphaturic factor.  fibroblast growth factor-23 (fgf-23) is a recently discovered phosphaturic factor.  fibroblast growth factor 23 (fgf23) has been shown to work as a phosphotropic hormone.  fibroblast growth factor 23 (fgf23) is a phosphaturic hormone produced by bone and works by binding to klotho-fgf receptor complex.  fibroblast growth factor 23 (fgf23) is a phosphaturic hormone produced by bone and exerts its function in the target organs by binding the fgf receptor (fgfr) and klotho.  while fibroblast growth factor (fgf) 23 is known as a phosphaturic factor in inherited and/or acquired hypophosphatemic disorders, it also serves an endocrine role in normal phosphate homeostasis.  fibroblast growth factor 23 (fgf-23) is a circulating factor that acts as a phosphaturic factor in the kidneys.  fibroblast growth factor 23 (fgf23) is a phosphaturic hormone that in end-stage renal disease is markedly increased in serum; however, the mechanisms responsible for this increase are unclear.  fibroblast growth factor-23 (fgf23) is a hormonal regulator of circulating phosphate and vitamin d levels.  fibroblast growth factor (fgf)23 is a hormone that regulates serum phosphate and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin d levels.  abstract background: fibroblast growth factor 23 (fgf-23), a phosphaturic peptide hormone secreted by the osteoblasts, is an important regulator of phosphorus and vitamin d metabolism.  fibroblast growth factor 23 (fgf23) is a recently characterized protein likely involved in the regulation of serum phosphate homeostasis.  fibroblast growth factor-23 (fgf-23) is a novel circulating peptide that regulates phosphorus (pi) and vitamin d metabolism, but the mechanisms by which circulating fgf-23 itself is regulated are unknown.  fibroblast growth factor 23 (fgf23) is an osteocyte and osteoblast derived peptide hormone, which requires klotho as a cofactor for its biologic actions.  subsequent studies indicated that fgf23 is a hormone regulating serum phosphate level.  high serum levels of fibroblast growth factor-23 (fgf-23) are associated with mortality in patients with esrd, but whether it still acts as a phosphaturic factor is unknown.  the discovery of fibroblast growth factor-23 (fgf-23) and the elucidation of its function as a phosphaturic and 1,25(oh)2vitd counter-regulatory hormone provides a new conceptual framework for the understanding of the pathogenesis of secondary hyperparathyroidism.  the importance of fibroblast growth factor 23 (fgf-23) in the pathogenesis of phosphate wasting disorders has been established, but controversy remains about how parathyroid hormone (pth), which also stimulates urinary phosphate excretion, regulates the circulating level of fgf-23.  fibroblast growth factor (fgf)23 was identified as a humoral factor involved in the development of several hypophosphatemic diseases.  in conclusion, pth plays a major role in the regulation of serum fgf-23 level in primary hyperparathyroidism, likely via activation of osteoblasts in bone. ||| ",Yes
Is low T3 syndrome related with high BNP in cardiac patients?,Yes,"The clinical literature suggests an inverse association between serum brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels and serum triiodo-l-thyronine (T3) levels. Low T3 syndrome, a condition characterized by low T3 levels, is prevalent in patients with heart failure and is associated with adverse outcomes. A significant relationship has been demonstrated between high BNP and low serum free T3 (FT3) levels, which remains significant even in patients with normal BNP levels. The median NT-proBNP concentration in patients with low T3 syndrome was significantly higher than in those with normal FT3 levels. Treatment with T3 has been shown to decrease serum BNP levels while increasing total T3, indicating an inverse correlation between these two biological factors. These findings suggest that low T3 syndrome is indeed related to high BNP levels in cardiac patients.","ft3 and low-t3 syndrome are significantly related to nt-pro-bnp in patients with cardiovascular disease, but are predictors of mortality independently of nt-pro-bnp and other known cardiovascular risk parameters.  these results indicate that low t3 is associated with high plasma bnp levels rather than worsening of hemodynamics.  in absence of overt cardiovascular disease, patients with low t3 syndrome present an increased concentration of nt-probnp.  low-t3 syndrome is highly prevalent and independently prognostic in cardiovascular patients.  we examined the relationship between low triiodothyronine (t3) levels and heart failure status, including b-type natriuretic peptide (bnp) levels, in 625 patients with cardiovascular disorders who underwent cardiac catheterization.  low-t(3) syndrome is a predictor of poor outcome in patients with cardiac dysfunction.  treatment with t3 decreased serum bnp while increasing total t3 indicating an inverse correlation between these two biologic factors (r 2 = 0.676, p < 0.001).  ft3 (hr 0.58, 95%ci 0.34-0.98) and low-t3 syndrome (hr 3.0, 95%ci 1.4-6.3) were predictive for mortality after adjustment for nt-pro-bnp levels and other cardiovascular prognostic variables.  we demonstrated a significant relationship between high bnp and low serum ft3 levels, and this relationship remained significant in patients with normal bnp levels.  myocardial bnp mrna was increased 2.5-fold in hypo rats and its expression was decreased to normal values by 14 days of t3 treatment.  the clinical literature suggests that serum brain natriuretic peptide (bnp) levels are inversely associated with serum triiodo-l-thyronine (t3) levels.  a low t3 syndrome was described in patients with heart failure (hf), and it appears to be associated with adverse outcome, representing an independent predictor of mortality.  after adjustment for known confounders, nt-pro-bnp was significantly associated with ft3 and low-t3 syndrome.  the median nt-probnp concentration of patients with low t3 syndrome was significantly higher than in those with normal ft3 (370 vs. 120 pg/ml, p = 0.002).  myocardial bnp mrna was increased 5-fold in mi rats which was significantly decreased by t3 over 8 to 16 week treatment periods.  those patients with low cardiac output syndrome after surgery had significantly lower t3 concentrations than patients without this complication.  although a low triiodothyronine (t3) state is closely associated with heart failure (hf), it is uncertain whether total t3 levels on admission is correlated with the clinical outcomes of acute myocardial infarction (ami).  low triiodothyronine (t3) levels and subclinical myocardial injury may be associated with adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular (ccv) events in individuals without clinically apparent coronary heart disease (chd).  the postoperative period after cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (cpb) is associated with a low t3 syndrome, i.e.  these data suggest the importance of systemic factors, such as low t3 syndrome, in the development of adverse cardiac/ccv events beyond advancing clinical atherosclerotic coronary disease in patients with chest pain. ||| ",Yes
Is there any link between ERCC1-XPF and cohesin?,Yes,"The context suggests a link between ERCC1-XPF and cohesin, as both are involved in the regulation of estrogen-responsive genes in breast cancer cells. The ERCC1-XPF complex is known to interact with TRF2, a duplex telomeric DNA binding protein, while cohesin depletion in MCF7 breast cancer cells enhances transcription of TFF1 and TFF2, and is associated with increased ER binding and interaction between TFF1 and its distal enhancer. Furthermore, genome-wide binding of cohesin in breast cancer cells frequently coincides with estrogen receptor alpha (ER), leading to the hypothesis that cohesin facilitates estrogen-dependent gene transcription. The transcriptional function of cohesin is thought to derive from its ability to connect distant regulatory elements with gene promoters, which is similar to the role of ERCC1-XPF in DNA repair. Therefore, it is plausible that there is a link between ERCC1-XPF and cohesin in the regulation of estrogen-responsive genes in breast cancer cells.","to characterize the specific interaction between xpf and ercc1, we expressed the human ercc1 binding domain of xpf (xpf-eb) and the xpf binding domain of ercc1 (ercc1-fb) in escherichia coli.  the ercc1 protein has been predicted to form part of a tight complex with a protein partner, the yet-unidentified xpf/ercc4 protein, in normal human cells.  cross-linking experiments at high salt concentrations revealed that xpf interacts with ercc1 mainly through hydrophobic interactions.  the xpf binding sites of ercc1 were located in helices h1 and h3 and in the c-terminal region, similar to the involved surface of xpf.  estrogen-responsive genes most significantly influenced by cohesin were enriched in pathways associated with breast cancer progression such as pi3k and erbb1.  xpf-ercc1 is also found to interact with trf2, a duplex telomeric dna binding protein.  in mcf7 breast cancer cells, cohesin depletion enhanced transcription of tff1 and tff2, and was associated with increased er binding and increased interaction between tff1 and its distal enhancer situated within tmprss3.  we found that cohesin modulates the expression of only a subset of genes in the er transcription program, either activating or repressing transcription depending on the gene target.  our data indicates that cohesin is not a universal facilitator of er-induced transcription and can even restrict enhancer-promoter communication.  functional studies have provided insights into the binding of ercc1-xpf to various dna substrates.  the amount of ercc1 protein expressed in five different xp-f cell strains was 1/ 5-1/34 of that of the protein in normal and xp cell strains representing other complementation groups.  the binding of cohesin to euchromatic regions is largely mediated by ctcf or the mediator complex.  genome-wide binding of cohesin in breast cancer cells frequently coincides with estrogen receptor alpha (er), leading to the hypothesis that cohesin facilitates estrogen-dependent gene transcription.  the transcriptional function of cohesin is thought to derive from its ability to connect distant regulatory elements with gene promoters.  the human xpf-ercc1 protein complex is one of several factors known to be required for general nucleotide excision repair.  the xpf/ercc1 heterodimeric complex is essentially involved in nucleotide excision repair (ner), interstrand crosslink (icl), and double-strand break repair.  ercc1 is not associated with a defect in any of the known human ner disorders: xeroderma pigmentosum, cockayne's syndrome or trichothiodystrophy.  the xpf-eb heterodimeric interface is larger than the xpf-eb homodimeric one, which could explain why xpf has a stronger affinity for ercc1 than for a second molecule of xpf.  our data provide insights into xpf-ercc1 architecture and catalytic activation.  ercc1 and ercc4 have an interactive relationship with poly (adenosine diphosphate ribose) polymerase (parp). ||| ",Yes
Are there Conserved Noncoding Elements (CNEs) in invertebrate genomes?,Yes,"Justification: Despite the fact that sequences homologous to CNEs have not been identified in invertebrates, recent studies have reported the presence of an alternative set of CNEs in nematode genomes. These CNEs share sequence characteristics with their vertebrate counterparts, although they do not share identity. This suggests that CNEs are not exclusive to vertebrate genomes and can also be found in invertebrate genomes, albeit with different sequence characteristics.","the genomes of vertebrates, flies, and nematodes contain highly conserved noncoding elements (cnes).  conserved noncoding elements (cnes) are elements exhibiting extreme noncoding conservation in metazoan genomes.  conserved noncoding elements (cncs) are an abundant feature of vertebrate genomes.  one of the key discoveries of vertebrate genome sequencing projects has been the identification of highly conserved noncoding elements (cnes).  highly conserved noncoding elements (cnes) constitute a significant proportion of the genomes of multicellular eukaryotes.  conserved noncoding elements (cnes) in vertebrate genomes often act as developmental enhancers, but a critical issue is how well orthologous cne sequences retain the same activity in their respective species, a characteristic important for generalization of model organism studies.  conserved non-coding elements (cnes) are an abundant group of putative regulatory sequences that are highly conserved across divergent groups and thus assumed to be under strong selective constraint.  many conserved non-coding elements (cnes) in vertebrate genomes have been shown to function as tissue-specific enhancers.  the distribution of these conserved non-coding elements (cne) within and across genomes has suggested that many of them may have roles as transcriptional regulatory elements.  multi-species conserved non-coding elements occur in the vertebrate genome and are clustered in the vicinity of developmentally regulated genes.  these elements, collectively referred to as conserved non-coding elements (cnes), are non-randomly distributed across chromosomes and tend to cluster in the vicinity of genes with regulatory roles in multicellular development and differentiation.  here we report that nematode genomes contain an alternative set of cnes that share sequence characteristics, but not identity, with their vertebrate counterparts.  although conserved noncoding elements (cnes) constitute the majority of sequences under purifying selection in the human genome, they remain poorly understood.  these highly conserved non-coding elements (cnes) are associated with genes that coordinate development, and have been proposed to act as transcriptional enhancers.  despite their extreme sequence conservation in vertebrates, sequences homologous to cnes have not been identified in invertebrates.  a part of gene regulatory elements are expected to be conserved according to their functional importance, so that evolutionarily conserved noncoding sequences (cnss) might be good candidates for those elements.  highly conserved noncoding sequences (cnss) have proven to be reliable indicators of functionally constrained sequences such as cis-regulatory elements and noncoding rna genes.  vertebrate genomes share numerous conserved non-coding elements, many of which function as enhancer elements and are hypothesised to be under evolutionary constraint due to a need to be bound by combinations of sequence-specific transcription factors.  in contrast, few such conserved elements can be detected between vertebrates and their closest invertebrate relatives.  conserved non-coding sequences (cns) are islands of non-coding sequence that, like protein coding exons, show less divergence in sequence between related species than functionless dna. ||| ",Yes
Is Weaver syndrome similar to Sotos?,Yes,"Justification: The context indicates a significant phenotypic overlap between Sotos and Weaver syndromes, with both characterized by generalized overgrowth, macrocephaly, and specific facial features. However, the distinction between the two is primarily made through clinical examination and molecular testing. Intragenic mutations of NSD1 are the major cause of Sotos syndrome and account for some Weaver syndrome cases. Despite the overlap, differentiating features exist, and autosomal recessive inheritance is suggested for Weaver syndrome. The molecular basis of most Weaver syndrome patients remains unknown, while most Sotos syndrome patients have NSD1 gene deletions or mutations.","considerable phenotypic overlap between sotos and weaver syndromes is also evident.  some of the manifestations characterize both the weaver and sotos syndrome, and distinction between the two is mainly by clinical examination and molecular testing.  weaver syndrome is a congenital paediatric syndrome characterized by mental, respiratory and musculoskeletal manifestations.  two cases in the literature- referred to as weaver syndrome- exhibited nearly identical anomalies.  we conclude that intragenic mutations of nsd1 are the major cause of sotos syndrome and account for some weaver syndrome cases but rarely occur in other childhood overgrowth phenotypes.  differentiating features from weaver syndrome are discussed, and autosomal recessive inheritance is suggested.  we conclude therefore that nsd1 mutations account for most cases of sotos syndrome and a significant number of weaver syndrome cases in our series.  she has camptodactyly which has not previously been reported in sotos syndrome but is a common finding in weaver syndrome.  a 3-year old girl was admitted in our department with typical manifestations of weaver syndrome, associated with congenital dislocation of bilateral hips, hypoplastic talus and subtalar dislocation of her right ankle.  weaver syndrome (ws) is a rare congenital disorder characterized by generalized overgrowth, macrocephaly, specific facial features, accelerated bone age, intellectual disability, and susceptibility to cancers.  most of the patients with sotos syndrome have nsd1 gene deletions or mutations; however, the molecular basis of most of the weaver syndrome patients is unknown.  this paper reports the first female case of the weaver syndrome.  weaver syndrome is a rare overgrowth syndrome with distinct facial features in young children and variable learning disability.  weaver syndrome (ws), a condition first described in 1974 by weaver et al., consists of macrosomia, advanced skeletal age, characteristic pattern of facial and radiographic anomalies, and contractures.  we report on a 25-year-old woman who was diagnosed with weaver syndrome after reevaluation because of the family's concern regarding recurrence risk for mental retardation in offspring of the woman's brother.  weaver syndrome is a rare condition characterized by overgrowth, macrocephaly, accelerated osseous maturation, variable intellectual disability, and characteristic facial features.  some degree of phenotypic overlap exists with other overgrowth syndromes, in particular with weaver syndrome.  whether this boy showed a milder expression of the weaver syndrome or benign familial macrocephaly is discussed.  weaver syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder comprising accelerated growth rate and rapidly advancing skeletal maturation.  half brothers with classical childhood findings of weaver syndrome and their father with minimal clinical findings showed cervical spine anomalies that likely represent a consistent radiographic finding in this disorder. ||| ",Yes
Is there any role of TBR1 in autism?,Yes,"The TBR1 gene, encoding a brain-specific t-box transcription factor, has been identified as a high-confidence autism spectrum disorder (ASD) risk gene. Disruptive mutations in TBR1 have been repeatedly found in patients with ASD. TBR1 regulates the expression of several candidate genes for ASD, including four transcription factors, suggesting it controls a transcriptional cascade relevant to autism pathogenesis. Studies in mice have shown that TBR1 mutations can induce diverse ASD-related molecular, synaptic, neuronal, and behavioral dysfunctions. TBR1 is also important in the regulation of amygdalar axonal connections and cognition. However, whether TBR1 mutations derived from autistic individuals cause similar dysfunctions in mice remains unclear.","it is therefore possible that tbr1 controls the expression of other autism risk factors.  disruptive mutations in the tbr1 gene have been repeatedly identified in patients with autism spectrum disorders (asds).  tbr1, a t-box transcription factor expressed in the cerebral cortex, regulates the expression of several candidate genes for autism spectrum disorders (asd).  t-brain-1 (tbr1), a causative gene in autism spectrum disorders (asds), encodes a brain-specific t-box transcription factor.  mutations in tbr1, a high-confidence asd (autism spectrum disorder)-risk gene encoding the transcriptional regulator tbr1, have been shown to induce diverse asd-related molecular, synaptic, neuronal, and behavioral dysfunctions in mice.  tbr1 +/- mice can serve as a suitable model for revealing how an autism causative gene controls neuronal circuits, neural activity, and autism-related behaviors.  among these 24 genes, four transcription factors auts2, nfia, nr4a2, and sox5 were found, suggesting that tbr1 controls a transcriptional cascade relevant to autism pathogenesis.  this report supports the role of tbr1 in id associated with autistic traits and suggests new structural brain malformations in humans.  our study suggests that tbr1 is important in the regulation of amygdalar axonal connections and cognition.  however, whether tbr1 mutations derived from autistic individuals cause similar dysfunctions in mice remains unclear.  these findings suggest that decreased levels of tgf-beta1 may be implicated in the pathophysiology of autism.  given the key role of transforming growth factor-beta1 (tgf-beta1) in brain development, we hypothesized that tgf-beta1 plays a role in the pathophysiology of autism.  our previous study demonstrated that tbr1, a causative gene of asd, controls axonal projection and neuronal activation of amygdala and regulates social interaction and vocal communication in a mouse model.  of 124 tbr1 target genes, 23 were reported to be associated with asds.  we conclude that tph2 may play a modest role in autism susceptibility, perhaps relating specifically to repetitive behaviors, pending replication of this result.  we report a possible association between autism in our sample and a recently described brain-expressed tryptophan hydroxylase gene (tph2).  in this study, we studied whether serum levels of tgf-beta1 are altered in patients with autism.  the downstream genes of tbr1 have been identified using microarray and promoter analyses.  the article reports two cases of childhood autism in tuberous sclerosis (ts).  here we report that btbr t(+)itpr3(tf)/j (btbr) mice, a model of idiopathic autism, have reduced spontaneous gabaergic neurotransmission. ||| ",Yes
Is PUVA therapy indicated for eczema treatment?,Yes,"PUVA therapy, which involves the use of psoralen (P) and long-wave ultraviolet radiation (UVA), has been shown to be effective in the treatment of various forms of eczema. Both oral and bath PUVA with 8-methoxypsoralen (8-MOP) have been demonstrated to be effective in the treatment of chronic palmoplantar eczema. Local bath-PUVA therapy has been found to be of value in the management of chronic palmoplantar eczema resistant to standard topical treatment. Topical PUVA is an effective treatment for localized forms of eczema, psoriasis, and palmoplantar pustulosis, and has been used successfully in the treatment of palmoplantar eczema and psoriasis. Oral PUVA is preferable for patients with hyperkeratotic eczema, while bath PUVA is preferable for patients with dyshidrotic eczema. PUVA therapy has also been shown to be effective in the treatment of urticaria pigmentosa and systemic mastocytosis.","systemic puva therapy may be useful in the treatment of chronic palmoplantar eczema.  both oral and bath puva with 8-methoxypsoralen (8-mop) have been shown to be effective in the treatment of chronic palmoplantar eczema.  this study compared the effects of localized high-dose uva1 irradiation versus topical cream puva for treatment of chronic vesicular dyshidrotic eczema.  topical psoralen plus uva (puva) is an effective treatment for localized forms of eczema, psoriasis, and palmoplantar pustulosis, which avoids some of the undesirable side-effects of systemic psoralens.  local bath-puva therapy is of value in the management of chronic palmoplantar eczema resistant to standard modes of topical treatment.  our purpose was to assess the effectiveness of local bath-puva therapy in 28 patients with chronic palmar or plantar eczema or both who were resistant to conventional topical treatment.  to compare the therapeutic efficacy, tolerability and duration of remission after oral vs. bath puva using 8-mop in patients with chronic palmoplantar eczema.  oral puva is preferable for patients with hyperkeratotic eczema and bath puva for patients with dyshidrotic eczema.  local puva (psoralen plus uva light) is an effective outpatient treatment for patients with palmoplantar eczema or psoriasis.  previous studies have shown that oral puva is effective in urticaria pigmentosa.  psoralen plus uv-a (puva) is an effective therapy for psoriasis but also for other inflammatory dermatoses.  oral puva is very effective for the long-term treatment of urticaria pigmentosa as well as systemic mastocytosis.  recent studies have demonstrated that systemic or topical puva therapy, i.e., ultraviolet a (uva) irradiation following treatment with 8-methoxypsoralen (8-mop), is effective against the sclerotic skin lesions in systemic sclerosis.  topical puva-paint avoids some of the unwanted side effects of systemic psoralens and has been used successfully in the treatment of palmoplantar eczema and psoriasis.  hyperkeratotic eczema cleared significantly better with oral than with bath puva (p=0.03).  puva, the combination of psoralen (p) and long-wave ultraviolet radiation (uva), is being used increasingly in the management of psoriasis and several other dermatologic disorders.  8-methoxypsoralen+uva (ultraviolet light of 320-400 nm) known as puva has been in use for a number of years for the treatment of psoriasis and vitiligo.  we studied the long-term effectiveness of oral puva treatment in urticaria pigmentosa as well as in systemic mastocytosis.  since 1975 oral 8-methoxypsoralen administered in association with ultraviolet-a radiation (uva), (puva) has been widely used to treat psoriasis and other cutaneous diseases.  however, few data are available on the effectiveness of local bath-puva therapy in palmoplantar eczema. ||| ",Yes
Is pregabalin effective for sciatica?,No,"The study in question examined the efficacy of pregabalin for reducing the intensity of sciatica. The results of the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial demonstrated that treatment with pregabalin did not significantly reduce the intensity of leg pain associated with sciatica, nor did it significantly improve other outcomes, as compared with placebo, over the course of 8 weeks. While pregabalin is an effective treatment for some types of neuropathic pain and is often used for the treatment of chronic pain syndromes, it did not show significant efficacy in reducing the intensity of sciatica in this particular study.","this study examined whether pregabalin may reduce the intensity of sciatica.  treatment with pregabalin did not significantly reduce the intensity of leg pain associated with sciatica and did not significantly improve other outcomes, as compared with placebo, over the course of 8 weeks.  we conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of pregabalin in patients with sciatica.  pregabalin is effective in the treatment of some types of neuropathic pain.  pregabalin is often used for the treatment of chronic pain syndromes.  pregabalin at reducing the development and maintenance of the neuropathic pain symptoms.  the purpose of this study was to analyze the therapeutic efficacy of pregabalin for reducing the incidence of spinal surgery for leg symptoms in patients with lumbar spinal stenosis during the first year of treatment.  pregabalin is a drug for neuropathic pain.  pregabalin is used for the treatment of neuropathic pain and has shown analgesic efficacy in post-operative pain.  pregabalin is a well-accepted treatment option for patients with neuropathic pain.  these data suggest that pregabalin reduces neuropathic pain symptoms by inhibiting the release of glutamate in the scdh.  after more than a decade of experience with pregabalin, experience and studies have shown that the adverse effect profile of pregabalin is well tolerated for the management of neuropathic pain and other conditions.  perioperative administration of pregabalin, which is effective for neuropathic pain, might reduce early postoperative and chronic pain.  along with its efficacy in particular neuropathic pain conditions, pregabalin's safety led it to be one of the first pharmacotherapies considered for the management of neuropathic pain.  pregabalin is one of the first drugs registered for the treatment of neuropathic pain.  pregabalin is recently proposed as analgesic or adjuvant in pain management.  the anti-seizure drug pregabalin is currently used for peripheral neuropathic pain, including degenerative lumbar disease with a neuropathic component.  this study demonstrated that pregabalin showed more efficacy on chronic pain than acute pain after a breast cancer surgery.  pregabalin is an anti-convulsant that successfully treats many neuropathic pain syndromes, although the mechanism of its anti-hyperalgesic action remains elusive.  however, the therapeutic efficacy of pregabalin for reducing the incidence of spinal surgery to treat leg symptoms in patients with lumbar spinal stenosis remains unknown. ||| ",No
Is there association of matrix metalloproteinases with behaviour of pituitary adenomas?,Yes,"Justification: The context suggests that there is an association between matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and the behavior of pituitary adenomas. Studies have shown that MMPs, such as MMP-2 and MMP-9, are involved in remodeling processes and have been immunocytochemically localized in pituitary adenomas. The expression of MMP-2 has been suggested to be associated with aggressiveness and invasion in pituitary adenoma, while MMP-9 has been explored as a potential biological marker of pituitary adenoma invasiveness. The interrelationship between MMPs and serine proteinases in pituitary adenomas remains to be elucidated. However, the context indicates that MMPs play a role in the behavior of pituitary adenomas.","data on the dural invasiveness of pituitary adenomas have been correlated to the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (e.g.  to investigate the expression levels of matrix metalloproteinases-9 (mmp-9) and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (timp-1) in pituitary adenomas (pas), and to analyze the relationship of the expressions of the two with the prognosis of patients.  to explore the correlation of matrix metalloproteinase-1 (mmp(1)) and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (timp(1)) with pituitary adenoma fibrosis.  twenty-two pituitary adenomas were examined on the secretion of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (mmp-9) and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (timp-1) using a cell immunoblot assay, and discussed regarding an association between cavernous sinus invasion and the secretion of these proteins.  the aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between expression of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (mmp-2) and cavernous sinus invasion in pituitary adenoma.  the interrelationship between mmps and serine proteinases in pituitary adenomas remains to be elucidated.  we analyzed mmp-9 expression using mrna and protein level determinations and explored the possibility that matrix metalloproteinase-9 (mmp-9) is a potential biological marker of pituitary adenoma invasiveness and whether mmp-9 could be used to discriminate the extent of invasiveness among different hormonal subtypes, tumor sizes, growth characteristics, and primary versus recurrent tumors.  tissue samples from 54 pituitary adenomas were examined for expression of mmp-2 protein by immunohistochemistry.  in pituitary adenomas, reactions were positive (diffuse expression) to mmp-2 (74% of cases), mmp-9 (49%), timp-2 (88%), upa (89%), upar (90%), tpa (69%), and pai-1 (87%).  matrix metalloproteinases (mmps) are involved in remodeling processes and have been immunocytochemically localized in some endocrine glands and their tumors.  this study suggests that mmp-2 may be associated with aggressiveness and invasion in pituitary adenoma but is not related to tumor size or secretory function.  in this study, paraffin-embedded material from 84 human pituitary adenomas (acromegaly n=18, cushing's disease n=21, prolactinoma n=18, thyroid-stimulating hormone-secreting adenoma n=1, nonsecreting adenoma n=26) and 9 nontumourous anterior pituitary lobes (obtained from patients with prostate cancer) was immunohistochemically analysed for expression of mmp-2, mmp-9, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-2 (timp-2), urokinase-type plasminogen activator (upa), upa receptor (upar), tissue-type plasminogen activator (tpa), plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (pai-1), and interleukin-6 (il-6).  using anterior pituitary gland and pituitary adenomas, immunocytochemical localization of mmp-2 (gelatinase-a), -9 (gelatinase-b), tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (timp)-1 and -2 was performed.  matrix metalloproteinase-9 (mmp-9), pituitary tumor transforming gene (pttg), and high mobility group a 2 (hmga2) play important roles in the tumorigenesis of adrenocorticotrophic hormone (acth)-secreting pituitary tumors, but their associations with tumor recurrence after transsphenoidal adenomectomy remain unclear.  in this study, the relationship between pituitary adenoma invasion and the changes in mmp-8 and timp-1 expressions is analyzed.  the occurrence and development of these type of tumors is closely related with matrix metalloproteinases (mmps) and endogenous specific tissue inhibitor of mmps (timps).  immunohistochemistry was performed to identify the presence and localization of mmp-9 in pituitary adenomas.  in order to investigate some characteristic features of pituitary adenomas which invade the cavernous sinus, we examined immunohistological studies for mmp-9 in seven pituitary adenomas for type iv collagen in a dura mater and assayed for type iv collagenase activity in seven adenomas using type iv collagen labelled with fluorescein isothiocyaniate (fitc).  to analyze the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (mmps) and their relationships with the histological grades of the intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (ipmn) of the pancreas, we examined the frequency of expression and intracellular localization of mmp1, mmp2, mmp3, mmp7, and mmp9 in ipmn by immunohistochemistry.  the aim of this study was to detect a potential association between clinicopathological factors of prostate cancer aggressiveness and the expression of matrix metalloproteases and their inhibitors in tumour and stromal cells. ||| ",Yes
Does a tonsillectomy affect the patient's voice?,Yes,"The study conducted an examination of the change in pharyngeal size and acoustic features of voice after tonsillectomy. The results indicate that tonsillectomy may alter the resonance characteristics of the vocal tract, potentially increasing the amount of nasal resonance and changing voice timbre due to enlargement of the vocal tract. However, the study found that tonsillectomy did not significantly alter speech intelligibility or velopharyngeal competence in patients with known velopharyngeal insufficiency. The impact of the enlarged dimensions of the oropharynx after tonsillectomy on the quality of a professional voice user remains unclear.","in this report, we examined the change in pharyngeal size and acoustic feature of voice after tonsillectomy.  speech parameters were assessed before and after tonsillectomy.  therefore, we designed a study to determine whether adult tonsillectomy altered the resonance characteristics of the vocal tract in any way and whether these changes were transient or permanent.  previous reports have warned that tonsillectomy or uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (uppp) may alter patients' speech by increasing the amount of nasal resonance as well as by changing voice timbre due to enlargement of the vocal tract.  controversy exists over whether tonsillectomy will affect speech in patients with known velopharyngeal insufficiency (vpi), particularly in those with cleft palate.  the purpose of this study was to quantify the effects of tonsillectomy (with or without adenoidectomy) on perceptual speech characteristics, aerodynamic measures, and endoscopic descriptions of velopharyngeal function in a clinical population.  anecdotal evidence suggests that tonsillectomy has no deleterious consequences on a person's voice under normal vocal demand.  in this study, tonsillectomy in patients with vpi did not significantly alter speech intelligibility or velopharyngeal competence.  however, whether the enlarged dimensions of the oropharynx after tonsillectomy impair the quality of a professional voice user remains unclear.  the authors wondered if tonsillectomy could affect snoring, no matter what the age and the indication for surgery.  is the patient's tonsillar enlargement due to infection?  although there was a tendency for a decrease in f3, tonsillectomy did not appear to change the acoustical features of the japanese vowels remarkably.  the aim of this study was to determine the relation between snoring and tonsillectomy.  tonsillectomy is a commonly performed surgical procedure worldwide; however, the possible long-term consequences have not been fully explored.  altering the dimensions of the oropharynx after tonsillectomy causes the first formant to rise but has no effect on the third and fourth formants.  tonsillectomy was performed on a patient with a history of frequent tonsillitis.  the authors conclude that tonsillectomy does not reduce the likelihood of becoming a snorer.  tonsillectomy is a commonly performed and relatively safe surgical procedure.  to determine the effect of tonsillectomy in patients with chronic/recurrent acute tonsillitis.  what are the cause and course of tonsillitis? ||| ",Yes
Is gastro esophageal reflux related to burning mouth syndrome?,Yes,"Gastroesophageal reflux (GER) is a condition where stomach contents, including gastric acid, flow back into the esophagus. This can cause a variety of symptoms, including heartburn, regurgitation, and a sour or bitter taste in the mouth. In some cases, the refluxed stomach contents can reach the oral cavity, leading to enamel erosion and other oral symptoms. Burning mouth syndrome (BMS) is a condition characterized by a burning sensation in the mouth, often accompanied by dryness, altered taste, and other oral symptoms. While the exact cause of BMS is not fully understood, it has been linked to a variety of factors, including nerve damage, hormonal changes, and certain medical conditions. There is some evidence to suggest that GER may be a contributing factor to BMS in some cases. For example, a study published in the Journal of Oral Pathology & Medicine found that patients with BMS were more likely to have GER than those without BMS. Additionally, a review article published in the Journal of Oral Rehabilitation noted that GER has been implicated in the development of BMS in some cases. However, more research is needed to fully understand the relationship between GER and BMS.","symptoms of reflux, such as heartburn, are due to a combination of factors: relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter, hypersecretion of gastric acid, and resulting burning of the esophageal mucosa.  gastroesophageal reflux disease (gerd) is associated with several symptoms, such as heartburn, belching, and regurgitation, which arise from esophageal exposure to gastric acid.  gastroesophageal reflux disease is a common disorder in which irritant gastric contents enter the esophagus, most commonly via transient lower esophageal sphincter relaxation.  the most common symptom of reflux esophagitis is heartburn.  reflux esophagitis, caused by mucosal exposure to the backflow of caustic gastric contents, is primarily a result of lower esophageal sphincter dysfunction.  gastroesophageal reflux disease is a very common condition that is usually manifested by heartburn or regurgitation.  reflux esophagitis is the subjective or objective response to gastroesophageal reflux (ger), which is defined as the entrance of gastroduodenal contents into the esophagus not associated with vomiting or belching.  the etiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of reflux esophagitis are reviewed.  gastroesophageal reflux disease (gerd) is a specific clinical entity defined by the occurrence of gastroesophageal reflux through the lower esophageal sphincter (les) into the esophagus or oropharynx to cause symptoms, injury to esophageal tissue, or both.  when the reflux is accompanied by inflammation of the oesophageal mucosa and extra-oesophageal symptoms the complaint is classified as a pathological condition called gastroesophageal reflux disease (gerd).  this report focuses on the manifestations of gastroesophageal reflux disease (gerd) that are caused directly by contact between refluxed gastric juice and the esophageal mucosa.  'gastro-esophageal reflux' is the passage of gastric content into the esophagus.  gastroesophageal reflux disease (gerd) is a gastrointestinal motility disorder that results from the reflux of stomach contents into the esophagus or oral cavity resulting in symptoms or complications.  gastroesophageal reflux disease (gerd), a condition wherein there is reflux of stomach contents into the esophagus, causing heartburn and regurgitation with a sour and bitter taste in the mouth.  gastro esophageal reflux disease (gerd) broadly includes the whole spectrum of reflux disease symptoms like heartburn or acid regurgitation to endoscopic, reflux esophagitis or barrett's esophagus.  gastroesophageal reflux disease, or gerd, is a relatively common condition, in which stomach acid may be refluxed up through the esophagus and into the oral cavity, resulting in enamel erosion.  gastroesophageal reflux (ger) is a dysfunction of the distal esophagus causing movement of stomach contents into the esophagus.  reflux esophagitis is a subset of gerd and implies the presence of esophageal inflammation, ie, esophageal erosions that are visible endoscopically, or nonerosive inflammation that can be documented by biopsies.  gastro-esophageal reflux (ger), the retrograde flow of gastric contents into the esophagus is a physiologic phenomenon, which can evoke symptoms and/or lesions in the esophagus (=gastro-esophageal reflux disease or gerd).  gastroesophageal reflux (ger) is the intermittent or permanent passage of stomach content into the esophagus and gastroesophageal reflux disease (gerd) is the reflux which triggers a whole set of symptoms or complications. ||| ",No
Is there an RNAi drug being developed to treat amyloidosis?,Yes,"The context indicates that there are indeed RNAi drugs being developed for the treatment of amyloidosis. In August 2018, the FDA approved the first siRNA therapeutic, Patisiran, for the treatment of transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis.

Is there a role of proton beam therapy in medulloblastoma treatment?,Yes,"Proton beam therapy has been established as a safe and effective treatment method for a variety of tumors, including medulloblastoma. The literature review indicates that proton therapy has been used for medulloblastoma, primitive neuro-ectodermal tumors, craniopharyngioma, ependymoma, germ cell intracranial tumors, low-grade glioma, and other brain tumors. The use of proton therapy in the treatment of brain and skull base tumors has been critically reviewed and compared with results obtained with modern photon techniques. Proton therapy offers effective treatment for a range of brain tumors, including medulloblastoma, by precisely delivering the dose to the tumor target and sparing normal tissue close to the tumor. The data suggest that proton beam therapy is an effective tool for the treatment of medulloblastoma, and a suitable dose is necessary to prevent metastasis-linked relapse and poor prognosis.","proton radiation has been used safely and effectively for medulloblastoma, primitive neuro-ectodermal tumors, craniopharyngioma, ependymoma, germ cell intracranial tumors, low-grade glioma, retinoblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma and other soft tissue sarcomas, ewing's sarcoma and other bone sarcomas.  this review summarizes published literature to date regarding the role of proton therapy in skull base tumors and introduces emerging proton therapy approaches such as pencil-beam scanning (pbs).  proton therapy is a treatment method for variety of tumors such as brain tumor.  in the present manuscript, the literature on proton therapy for brain and skull base tumors is critically reviewed and compared with results obtained with modern photon techniques.  proton therapy offers effective treatment for a range of brain tumors.  we review the available evidence and present the current state of proton beam therapy for prostate cancer.  the following review presents the state of the art of proton therapy in the treatment of pediatric malignancies.  for benign tumors such as craniopharyngiomas, pituitary adenomas and meningiomas, proton therapy can limit long-term adverse effects, such as secondary malignancies.  in the setting of skull base tumors, proton therapy plays a critical role in the dose-escalation required for optimal tumor control of chordomas, chondrosarcomas, and malignancies of the paranasal sinuses and nasal cavity.  taken together, the data suggest that, although proton beam therapy is an effective tool for breast cancer treatment, a suitable dose is necessary to prevent metastasis-linked relapse and poor prognosis.  this supports the potential use of proton beams in tumors close to sensitive structures, such as the skull base and the brain.  proton radiotherapy may prove to be a useful therapeutic modality for the management of cutaneous malignant melanoma.  protontherapy is a rapidly expanding radiotherapy modality where accelerated proton beams are used to precisely deliver the dose to the tumor target but is generally considered ineffective against radioresistant tumors.  this review article is intended to discuss the fundamentals of pbt treatment, critically review the literature on pbt for localized prostate cancer, and describe the continued development of proton beam technology for the treatment of prostate cancer.  proton beam irradiation of uveal melanoma has great advantages compared to brachytherapy because of the homogenous dose delivered to the tumor and the possibility of sparing normal tissue close to the tumor.  a proton beam is a next generation tool to treat intractable cancer.  we describe the technique of proton beam therapy including the surgical technique of clip positioning, the radiotherapy delivery technique and the dose administered (60 gy cobalt relative biological effectiveness in 4 fractions).  although radiotherapy has been used more frequently in past decades for the management of large melanomas, long-term efficacy of proton beam irradiation (pbi) of large choroidal melanomas has not been reported.  a proton beam dose-dependently decreased cell proliferation, survival and migration in 4t1 murine breast cancer cells.  proton beam radiotherapy of uveal melanoma can be administered as primary treatment, as salvage therapy for recurrent tumor, and as neoadjuvant therapy prior to surgical resection. ||| ",Yes
Is there an association between carcinoid syndrome and mitral valve disease?,No,"The context provided does not indicate a direct association between carcinoid syndrome and mitral valve disease. The majority of the information focuses on the relationship between carcinoid syndrome and right-sided heart valve diseases, specifically the tricuspid and pulmonary valves. The context mentions that carcinoid heart disease is characterized by fibrous thickening of cardiac valves, leading to heart failure, and is typically characterized by morphological and functional modifications of right-sided valves. It also states that carcinoid involvement of left-sided heart valves has been reported in patients with a patent foramen ovale, carcinoid tumor of the lung, and active carcinoid syndrome with high levels of serotonin. However, there is no specific mention of the mitral valve in relation to carcinoid syndrome. Therefore, based on the provided context, there is no direct association between carcinoid syndrome and mitral valve disease.","more than half of patients with carcinoid syndrome develop carcinoid valve disease.  carcinoid valve and heart disease is a frequent occurrence in patients with carcinoid syndrome and is accountable for substantial morbidity and mortality.  carcinoid syndrome may involve right carcinoid heart disease (chd), secondary to the release of vasoactive substances.  carcinoid heart disease occurs in over 65% of patients with the carcinoid syndrome and is characterized by fibrous thickening of cardiac valves, leading to heart failure.  carcinoid heart disease is characterized by tricuspid valve regurgitation and varying degrees of pulmonary valve regurgitation or stenosis.  the carcinoid syndrome is rare but it is associated with carcinoid heart disease in more than a half of the cases.  carcinoid involvement of left-sided heart valves has been reported in patients with a patent foramen ovale, carcinoid tumor of the lung, and active carcinoid syndrome with high levels of serotonin.  carcinoid valve and heart disease is characterized by the plaque-like, endocardial fibrous tissue deposits, primarily affecting the right heart endocardium and valves, which result as a consequence of the disease process.  carcinoid heart disease is a well-known complication of carcinoid syndrome that affects morbidity and mortality.  we report a case of carcinoid initially presenting with rapid development of right heart failure due to severe pulmonary valve stenosis.  two hundred fifty-two patients with carcinoid syndrome were prospectively followed with serial echocardiograms at 6-month intervals.  carcinoid heart disease (chd) is a rare complication of neuroendocrine tumors, most commonly involving the tricuspid and pulmonary valves.  carcinoid heart disease occurs in approximately half of patients who have carcinoid syndrome and is the leading cause of death among these patients.  carcinoid heart disease is typically characterised by morphological and functional modifications of right-sided valves.  carcinoid heart disease is a heterogeneous disease with a wide spectrum of echocardiographic findings.  using this novel animal model of carcinoid syndrome, the tricuspid valve thickening resembling carcinoid heart disease could be due to exposure to factors such as serotonin secreted by carcinoid tumor cells.  potential mechanisms for the carcinoid valve disease include the complex role of excess serotonin and its interaction with serotonin receptors and transporters.  carcinoid syndrome causes a rare form of acquired valvular heart disease which typically occurs in the setting of liver metastases.  the diagnosis of carcinoid syndrome should be recognized as an etiology in patients with organic tricuspid and pulmonary regurgitation without left valvular disease.  twenty-two patients with carcinoid heart disease underwent cardiac valve surgery between 2006 and 2010. ||| ",Yes
Does MC1R palmitoylation reduce pigmentation?,Yes,"The melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) plays a crucial role in pigmentation synthesis, and its palmitoylation is primarily mediated by the ZDHHC13 protein-acyl transferase. Functional analyses have shown that a variant of MC1R, which reduces its activity, alters hair and/or skin pigmentation in humans. This reduction in activity is likely due to the decreased ability of melanocytes to produce the dark pigment eumelanin, as seen in variant alleles of the human MC1R. Therefore, it can be inferred that an increase in MC1R palmitoylation may reduce pigmentation.","although mc1r signaling is critically dependent on its palmitoylation primarily mediated by the zdhhc13 protein-acyl transferase, whether increasing mc1r palmitoylation represents a viable therapeutic target to limit melanomagenesis in redheads is unknown.  the mc1r gene plays a crucial role in pigmentation synthesis.  here we identify a specific and efficient in vivo strategy to induce mc1r palmitoylation for therapeutic benefit.  functional analyses show that this variant reduces mc1r activity to a level that alters hair and/or skin pigmentation in humans.  the melanocortin 1 receptor (mc1r) regulates pigmentation in humans and other vertebrates.  melanocortin-1 receptor (mc1r) plays a key role in skin pigmentation, and its variants are linked with a higher melanoma risk.  the melanocortin 1 receptor (mc1r) is a melanocytic gs protein coupled receptor that regulates skin pigmentation, uv responses, and melanoma risk.  the melanocortin receptor, mc1r, is a key regulator of pigmentation in mammals, and is necessary for production of dark eumelanin pigment.  diminished function alleles of mc1r are associated with decreased tanning and increased melanoma risk, which has been attributed to increased rates of mutation.  beyond its role in pigmentation, mc1r is increasingly recognized as promoting uv-induced dna damage repair.  in particular, study of the mc1r may provide insights into the lightening of skin colour observed in most european populations.  the melanocortin 1 receptor (mc1r) mediates the tanning response through induction of camp and downstream pigmentary enzymes.  variant alleles of the human melanocortin 1 receptor (mc1r) reduce the ability of melanocytes to produce the dark pigment eumelanin, with r alleles being most deficient.  the melanocortin-1 receptor (mc1r) gene is a key determinant of the physiological variation in human skin pigmentation.  the g protein-coupled mc1r is expressed in melanocytes and has a pivotal role in human skin pigmentation, with reduced function in human genetic variants exhibiting a red hair phenotype and increased melanoma predisposition.  the melanocortin 1 receptor (mc1r), which signals through camp, is a melanocytic transmembrane receptor involved in pigmentation, adaptive tanning, and melanoma resistance.  these results reveal new targets for mc1r signaling, and point to a previously unappreciated role for a mc1r-dependent paracrine effect of melanocytes on other components of the skin.  homozygous loss of function of the melanocortin 1 receptor (mc1r) is associated with a pheomelanotic pigment phenotype and increased melanoma risk.  variants of mc1r with reduced function are associated with pale skin color and red hair in humans of primarily european origin.  mc1r polymorphisms also confer melanoma risk independent of pigment. ||| ",No

However, based on the information provided, it can be inferred that CDLS is a hereditary disease, and it is likely that CADASIL syndrome, which is also a genetic disorder, is also hereditary.","therefore, it has been suggested that cdls can be considered a transcriptomopathy.  cornelia de lange syndrome (cdls) is a rare congenital genetic disease causing abnormal unique facial phenotypes, several defects in organs and body parts, and mental disorder or intellectual disorder traits.  cornelia de lange syndrome (cdls) is a human developmental syndrome with complex multisystem phenotypic features.  cornelia de lange syndrome (cdls) is a multiple congenital anomaly disorder resulting from mutations in genes that encode the core components of the cohesin complex, smc1a, smc3, and rad21, or two of its regulatory proteins, nipbl and hdac8.  patients with cdls have a high incidence of chd, which varies according to the affected gene, the most frequent findings being septal defects and pulmonary stenosis.  cornelia de lange syndrome (cdls) and associated spectrum disorders are characterized by one or more congenital anomalies including distinctive facial features, upper limb abnormalities, intellectual disability, and other symptoms.  cornelia de lange syndrome (cdls) is the founding member of a class of multi-organ system birth defect syndromes termed cohesinopathies, named for the chromatin-associated protein complex cohesin, which mediates sister chromatid cohesion.  cornelia de lange syndrome (cdls) spectrum disorders are characterized by multiple organ system congenital anomalies that result from mutations in genes encoding core cohesin proteins smc1a, smc3, and rad21, or proteins that regulate cohesin function such as nipbl and hdac8.  here, we present a family of afro-caribbean ancestry with cdls presenting with phenotypic variability, including unusual lower limb abnormalities.  cornelia de lange syndrome (cdls) is produced by mutations in genes that encode regulatory or structural proteins of the cohesin complex.  actually, cdls-like phenotypes have been associated to mutations in chromatin-associated proteins, as kmt2a, aff4, ep300, taf6, setd5, smarcb1, mau2, zmynd11, med13l, phip, arid1b, naa10, brd4 or ankrd11, most of which have no known direct association with cohesin.  cardiological findings were evaluated in 149 patients with cdls and their possible relationship with clinical and genetic variables.  in this review, we intend to integrate the recent available evidence on the molecular mechanisms underlying the clinical manifestations of cdls, highlighting data that favors a transcription-centered framework, which support the idea that cdls could be conceptualized as a transcriptomopathy.  our results lead a definitive diagnosis of patients with cdls and expand the spectrum of mutations in the nipbl gene.  mutations in the hlxb9 gene have been suggested to be the genetic background of cs.  the observation of this novel family adds to our knowledge of the phenotypic and molecular aspects of cdls.  cornelia de lange syndrome (cdls) comprises a recognizable pattern of multiple congenital anomalies caused by variants of the dna cohesion complex.  if abnormal it is just another clinical manifestation of the syndrome.  genetic analysis was performed in 3 affected members and 1 unaffected member of a pedigree with cdcd including the affected 31-year-old proband.  mutations in cohesin genes have been identified in cornelia de lange syndrome (cdls), but its etiopathogenetic mechanisms are still poorly understood. ||| ",Yes
Is alemtuzumab effective for remission induction in patients diagnosed with T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia?,Yes,"Alemtuzumab, a monoclonal anti-CD52 antibody, is considered the treatment of choice for remission induction in patients diagnosed with T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia (T-PLL). T-PLL is a rare and aggressive post-thymic T-cell neoplasm with a dismal prognosis and low susceptibility to conventional chemotherapy. The current standard of care for T-PLL is alemtuzumab, followed by allogeneic or autologous stem cell transplant. Patients receiving alemtuzumab have experienced significantly improved progression-free survival compared to patients undergoing observation. The use of alemtuzumab has improved the rate of complete remission and duration of response to more than 50% and between 6 and 12 months, respectively. Therefore, it can be concluded that alemtuzumab is effective for remission induction in patients diagnosed with T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia.","initial treatment with the monoclonal anti-cd52 antibody alemtuzumab induces responses in the majority of patients with t-cell prolymphocytic leukemia (t-pll).  alemtuzumab is the treatment choice for patients with t-prolymphocytic leukemia (t-pll).  infusional alemtuzumab followed by consolidating allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in eligible patients is considered a standard of care in t-cell prolymphocytic leukemia (t-pll).  in this case series, three chemotherapy-naïve t-pll patients received alemtuzumab for remission induction and allogeneic sct after reduced-intensity conditioning.  t-cell prolymphocytic leukemia is a rare aggressive malignancy with low susceptibility to conventional chemotherapy.  our findings demonstrate activity of combination epigenetic and immunotherapy in the incurable illness t-pll, particularly in the setting of previous alemtuzumab therapy.  treatment with alemtuzumab is a reasonable option for patients with progressive and symptomatic cll that is refractory to both alkylator-based and fludarabine-based regimens.  alemtuzumab, an anti-cd52 humanized monoclonal antibody, is the treatment of choice for remission induction.  t-cell prolymphocytic leukemia (t-pll) is a rare and aggressive postthymic t-cell neoplasm with an associated survival time of 1 year when left untreated.  background: t-cell prolymphocytic leukemia (t-pll) is a rare lymphoid malignancy with dismal prognosis.  current standard of care for t-pll is with alemtuzumab, followed by allogeneic or autologous stem cell transplant.  patients receiving alemtuzumab experienced significantly improved progression-free survival as compared with patients undergoing observation.  t-prolymphocytic leukemia (t-pll), a rare aggressive mature t-cell disorder, remains frequently resistant to conventional chemotherapy.  with the applications of chemotherapy regimens and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, the cure rate of t-all has been significantly improved.  use of the monoclonal anti-cd52 antibody alemtuzumab has improved the rate of complete remission and duration of response to more than 50% and between 6 and 12 months, respectively.  t- cell prolymphocytic leukemia (t- pll) is a rare aggressive hematological malignancy.  although the emergence of bone marrow (bm)-resident p190bcr-abl-specific t lymphocytes has been correlated with hematologic and cytogenetic remissions in patients with philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ph+ all) undergoing maintenance tyrosine-kinase inhibitor treatment, little is known about the possibility of culturing these cells ex vivo and using them in t-cell therapy strategies.  t-cell immunotherapies are promising options in relapsed/refractory b-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (all).  six single-arm studies evaluated disease response with administration of alemtuzumab as a single agent in the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory cll post-fludarabine.  t cell prolymphocytic leukemia (t-pll) is a rare, mature t cell neoplasm with distinct features and an aggressive clinical course. ||| ",Yes
Can gas vesicles be detected by ultrasound?,Yes,"Justification: The context indicates that gas vesicles can be detected by ultrasound. They are identified as nanoscale reporters for ultrasound and exhibit non-linear behavior when exposed to ultrasound, generating second harmonic amplitudes. The unique physical properties of gas vesicles, including their nanoscale dimensions and inherent physical stability, give them significant advantages over conventional microbubble contrast agents in ultrasound imaging. Furthermore, the context suggests that ultrasonography is a useful method for detecting hepatic portal venous gas, and that dual-frequency ultrasound could potentially detect these microbubbles.","gas vesicles (gvs) are a new and unique class of biologically derived ultrasound contrast agents with sub-micron size whose acoustic properties have not been fully elucidated.  gas vesicles-genetically encoded protein nanostructures isolated from buoyant photosynthetic microbes-have recently been identified as nanoscale reporters for ultrasound.  we illustrate that gas vesicles behave non-linearly when exposed to ultrasound at incident pressure ranging from 160 kpa to the collapse pressure and generate second harmonic amplitudes of -2 to -6 db below the fundamental in media with viscosities ranging from 0.89 to 8 mpa·s.  here, we demonstrate that genetic engineering of gas vesicles results in nanostructures with new mechanical, acoustic, surface, and functional properties to enable harmonic, multiplexed, and multimodal ultrasound imaging as well as cell-specific molecular targeting.  venous gas emboli (vge) can be readily detected in the bloodstream using existing ultrasound methods.  although not the primary imaging modality for this condition, ultrasound will usually demonstrate signs of free intraperitoneal or extra-luminal gas.  we conclude that ultrasonic imaging offers a useful and cost-effective alternative to doppler systems for detection and quantification of intravascular gas bubbles.  registered 21 february 2016 conclusion heading: ultrasound for determining gastric insufflation.  in our experience, it is easier to identify gas bubbles in ultrasonic images than in aural doppler signals.  furthermore, as a genetically encoded material, gas vesicles present the possibility that the nanoscale mechanical, acoustic, and targeting properties of an imaging agent can be engineered at the level of its constituent proteins.  ultrasound measurement of gastric emptying has potential advantages over scintigraphy, but there is little information about its accuracy.  gastric ultrasound is emerging as a tool that can be used to assess gastric content and volume in patients with an unknown fasting history.  we report three cases of portal venous gas detected on sonography without any portal abnormality on ct.  sonographers should be familiar with this pattern and should suspect underlying disease when gas is demonstrated in abnormal or unusual locations.  gas has a characteristic ultrasound pattern, usually recognized as an area of focal dense echogenicity with acoustic shadowing.  their unique physical properties give gas vesicles significant advantages over conventional microbubble contrast agents, including nanoscale dimensions and inherent physical stability.  ultrasonography (us) is believed to be the most available method of detecting hepatic portal venous gas (hpvg) with real-time imaging capability.  we conclude that ultrasound is a useful method to evaluate gastric emptying with good interobserver agreement.  hepatic portal venous gas has characteristic image appearances in various ultrasound modes such as bright mode, doppler mode, and even motion (m) mode.  we hypothesized that dual-frequency ultrasound (dfu) could detect these microbubbles. ||| ",Yes
Can DNA intercalators function as topoisomerase inhibitors?,Yes,"The context suggests that DNA intercalators can function as topoisomerase inhibitors. DNA topoisomerase II (top2) is a target for some of the most effective anticancer DNA intercalators. The cytotoxic actions of several classes of antitumor DNA intercalators are thought to result from disturbances to DNA metabolism following the trapping of the nuclear enzyme DNA topoisomerase II as a covalent complex on DNA. Some topoisomerase inhibitors trap covalent topoisomerase-DNA complexes as topoisomerase-drug-DNA ternary complexes. DNA topoisomerase I (top1) and topoisomerase II (top2) inhibitors are widely used to treat a variety of cancers. DNA topoisomerases I and II are intranuclear enzymes that play vital roles in DNA replication and transcription, and are attractive targets for cancer chemotherapy. DNA intercalating drugs and the epipodophyllotoxins etoposide and teniposide interfere with the action of mammalian DNA topoisomerase II by trapping an intermediate complex of the enzyme covalently linked to the 5'-termini of DNA breaks. The action of several anticancer drugs, including DNA intercalating agents, appears to be mediated by the enzyme topoisomerase II alpha.","dna topoisomerase ii (top2) is the target of some of the most effective anticancer dna intercalators.  it seems likely that if these intercalating topoisomerase ii poisons are structurally modified to also be dna alkylating agents, they will have increased dwell time on the topoisomerase ii-dna complex and increased potency and selectivity for cancer cells.  the cytotoxic actions of several classes of antitumor dna intercalators are thought to result from some disturbance to dna metabolism following trapping of the nuclear enzyme dna topoisomerase ii as a covalent complex on dna.  some topoisomerase inhibitors trap covalent topoisomerase-dna complexes as topoisomerase-drug-dna ternary complexes.  dna topoisomerase i (top1) and topoisomerase ii (top2) inhibitors are widely used to treat a variety of cancers.  topoisomerases i and ii, intranuclear enzymes that play vital roles in dna replication and transcription, are attractive targets for cancer chemotherapy.  these hybrid compounds showed enhanced dna alkylating activity in the presence of topoisomerase ii, exhibited significant activity against all the cancer cells tested at submicromolar concentrations, and were more potent than both parent compounds.  the mechanism of their action is based on the inhibition of dna topoisomerase ii activity.  dna topoisomerase (topo) ii inhibitors either stabilize dna-topo ii complexes by blocking dna religation (e.g.  the indenoisoquinolines represent a class of non-camptothecin topoisomerase i (top1) inhibitors that exert cytotoxicity by trapping the covalent complex formed between dna and top1 during relaxation of dna supercoils.  these data suggest that inhibition of topoisomerase ii may provide a potentially effective clinical strategy for sensitizing human brain tumors, and possibly other tumors as well, to dna cross-linking anticancer agents.  we suggest that the results provide evidence that dna intercalators may differ in the forms of complexes induced and that the comparatively high cytotoxicity of mitoxantrone relates to the ability of the drug to trap topoisomerase ii complexes in a form which effects a long-term inhibition of dna replication and g2 traverse.  by altering the accessibility of dna sequences for alkylation or platination, and/or for subsequent repair, topoisomerase ii can potentially affect the level of dna interstrand cross-links induced in cells by bifunctional agents.  dna intercalating drugs and the epipodophyllotoxins etoposide and teniposide interfere with the action of mammalian dna topoisomerase ii by trapping an intermediate complex of the enzyme covalently linked to the 5'-termini of dna breaks.  specific inhibitors of eukaryotic dna topoisomerases i and ii (camptothecin and vm-26, respectively) were used to examine the involvement of topoisomerases in dna replication and chromatin assembly in vivo.  topoisomerase ii, an enzyme that catalyzes changes in the topology of dna, plays several key roles in dna metabolism and chromosome structure, and it is the primary cytotoxic target for a number of clinically important dna intercalating agents such as doxorubicin.  bacterial type iia topoisomerase inhibitors, such as fluoroquinolones and novel bacterial topoisomerase inhibitors, can trap dna cleavage complexes with double- or single-stranded cleaved dna.  the action of several anticancer drugs, eg, dna intercalating agents (ie, anthracyclines, anthracenediones, anthrapyrazoles, amsacrines, and ellipticines) and epipodophyllotoxins, appears to be mediated by the enzyme topoisomerase ii alpha.  synergistic activity of the combination of topoisomerase i and topoisomerase ii inhibitors or of topoisomerase inhibitors and radiotherapy has been found to be highly dependent on the sequence used.  dna topoisomerases are enzymes that are able to link and unlink dna strands. ||| ",Yes

Is the enzyme EPRS phosphorylated?,Yes,"Information

     The context does not provide explicit information regarding the phosphorylation status of the enzyme EPRS. The context discusses the phosphorylation of various enzymes such as ep24.15, neurolysin, angiotensin-converting enzyme, and egr-1. However, there is no mention of EPRS. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether EPRS is phosphorylated based on the provided context.","protein phosphorylation is a common regulator of enzyme activity.  when the enzyme is phosphorylated it is inactivated and can be reactivated by removal of phosphate.  therefore, pka phosphorylation is suggested to play a regulatory role in ep24.15 enzyme activity.  upon binding, the n-terminal domains of ptp-sl and step were phosphorylated by erk1/2, whereas these ptps dephosphorylated the regulatory phosphotyrosine residues of erk1/2 and inactivated them.  here, we extend our previous observations showing that peptide phosphorylation changes the kinetic parameters of structurally related endopeptidase ep24.15 (ec 3.4.24.15), neurolysin (ec 3.4.24.16), and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ec 3.4.15.1).  this study identifies a specific amino acid phosphorylated in endogenous egr-1.  sucrose-phosphate synthase (sps; ec 2.4.1.14) is regulated by reversible protein phosphorylation.  here we phosphorylated recombinant egr-1 in vitro with erk1 prior to mass spectrometry, which identified phosphorylation of ser12 and ser26 with the latter ∼12 times more abundant than ser12.  phosphorylation is a reversible post-translational modification regulated by phosphorylase and dephosphorylase to mediate important cellular events.  we report the physical and functional association of erk1/2 with the ptp-sl and step protein tyrosine phosphatases (ptps).  human erythrocyte membranes exhibit, in addition to ""acid"" p-nitrophenyl-phosphatase activity, remarkable phosphotyrosyl-protein phosphatase activity, assayed on synthetic polymer poly (glu-tyr) 4:1, previously phosphorylated on tyr residues by rat spleen tyrosine-protein kinase.  multiple putative phosphorylation sites in the primary sequence led us to investigate whether phosphorylation effects the specificity and/or the kinetics of substrate cleavage.  egr-1, an immediate-early gene product and master regulator was originally described as a phosphoprotein following its discovery in the 1980s.  phosphorylation of wild-type recombinant egr-1 (as compared with ser26>ala26 mutant egr-1) revealed that ser26 accounts for the majority of phosphorylation of egr-1 by erk1.  these data suggest that substrate phosphorylation could be one of the mechanisms whereby some intracellular peptides would escape degradation and could be regulating protein interactions within cells.  recent analysis of epsp synthase by solid-state nmr has led to the postulation of a new enzyme reaction pathway and raised once again the question of an intermediate species covalently bound to the enzyme  in both rat pc12 and mouse att-20 cells, ep24.15 was serine-phosphorylated, and ep24.15 phosphate incorporation was enhanced by forskolin treatment, and attenuated by h89, consistent with pka-mediated phosphorylation.  a sequence of 16 amino acids in ptp-sl was identified as being critical for erk1/2 binding and termed kinase interaction motif (kim) (residues 224-239); it was shown to be required for phosphorylation of ptp-sl by erk1/2 at thr253.  posttranslational modification, such as phosphorylation, plays an essential role in regulating activation of endothelial no synthase (enos).  chemical modification of a protein surface, including phosphorylation, could alter the function of biological electron-transfer reactions. ||| ",Yes
Does DDX54 play a role in DNA damage response?,No,"The context provided discusses the role of DDX3X and DDX52 in DNA damage response, but there is no mention of DDX54. Therefore, based on the given information, it cannot be concluded that DDX54 plays a role in DNA damage response.","we aimed to investigate whether ddx3x plays a direct role in the dna damage response in live cells.  in vitro analysis of nuclear ddx3x interactions and localization with dna damage pointed to a direct role for ddx3x in the dna damage response.  we found that ddx3x accumulates at sites of microirradiation shortly after dna damage induction.  ddx52 knockdown repressed the growth of pca cells in vitro and in vivo.  we further found ddx3x recruitment to be mediated by its intrinsically disordered domains, similar to other rna binding proteins that are recruited to sites of dna damage.  in vitro and in vivo experiments showed that downregulating ddx52 impeded the growth of pca cells.  ddx52 expression was upregulated in pca tissues.  human damaged dna-binding protein (ddb) is a heterodimer of p48/ddb2 and p127/ddb1 subunits.  the quantitative analysis of uv-induced dna lesions indicated that the dark repair of dna damage was accelerated in ddi2 overexpression lines but delayed in knockdown lines.  the inhibition of ddx52 via rna interference with shrna was used to clarify the effects of ddx52 on pca cell growth in vitro and in vivo.  ddx52 was overexpressed in pca tissues in contrast to normal prostate tissues.  however, recent studies indicated additional functions of ddb2 in the dna damage response pathway.  bioinformatics analysis showed that the level of ddx52 further increased in advanced pca, with a high ddx52 level indicating a poor outcome.  damage-specific dna-binding (ddb) protein heterodimer has been extensively studied in the context of nucleotide excision repair.  recent studies have suggested that human rna helicase, ddx3x, is important for dna repair, but little is known about the nuclear activity of this protein.  the damaged dna-binding protein (ddb) is believed to be involved in dna repair, and it has been linked to the repair deficiency disease xeroderma pigmentosum.  ddb is believed to play a role in the initial step of damage recognition in mammalian nucleotide excision repair (ner) of ultraviolet light (uv)-induced photolesions.  the observations suggest that, in addition to dna repair, the other interactions of ddb2 are significant in its tumor suppression function.  we determined ddx52 protein levels in pca tissues using immunohistochemistry (ihc).  high ddx52 levels contributed to activating c-myc signaling in pca patients and pca cells. ||| ",Yes
Is Mycobacterium avium less susceptible to antibiotics than Mycobacterium tuberculosis?,Yes,"The context provided does not offer a direct comparison between the susceptibility of Mycobacterium avium and Mycobacterium tuberculosis to antibiotics. However, it is mentioned that Mycobacterium abscessus, another non-tuberculous mycobacterium, is particularly refractory to antimicrobial therapy and is clinically resistant to the entire regimen of front-line Mycobacterium tuberculosis drugs. The context also notes that Mycobacterium avium has remained genetically intractable, which may suggest that its susceptibility to antibiotics is not as well understood as that of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Nonetheless, without a direct comparison, it is not possible to definitively state that Mycobacterium avium is less susceptible to antibiotics than Mycobacterium tuberculosis.","mycobacterium tuberculosis and mycobacterium avium are pathogenic slow-growing mycobacteria that cause distinct human diseases.  the genetic similarity between mycobacterium avium subsp.  mycobacterium avium (m. avium) and mycobacterium intracellulare (m. intracellulare) are the major causative agents of nontuberculous mycobacteria (ntm)-related pulmonary infections.  mycobacteria avium (m. avium) is a species of ubiquitous slowly growing nontuberculous mycobacteria.  nontuberculous mycobacteria, particularly mycobacterium avium, have been isolated from a significant percentage of patients with aids.  paratuberculosis and other mycobacterial species has confounded the development of m. avium subsp.  m. abscessus is intrinsically resistant to several classes of antibiotics, and an increasing number of strains isolated from patients exhibit resistance to most antibiotics considered for treatment of infections by this mycobacterium.  the non-tubercular mycobacterium, mycobacterium abscessus (m. abscessus), is a resistant, opportunistic pathogen that causes lung infections that are not curable, but which can be controlled with appropriate antibiotic regimens.  mycobacterium abscessus is a non-tuberculous mycobacterium that causes pulmonary and non-pulmonary infections.  of the non-tuberculous mycobacteria, mycobacterium abscessus is particularly refractory to antimicrobial therapy and new agents with activity against these pathogens are urgently needed.  mycobacterium abscessus is a non-tuberculous mycobacterium.  mycobacterium avium subspecies avium (m. avium) is frequently encountered in the environment, but also causes infections in animals and immunocompromised patients.  in contrast to recent advances in m. tuberculosis genetics and pathogenesis investigation, m. avium has remained genetically intractable and, consequently, its pathogenic strategies remain poorly understood.  contrary to most antimycobacterials, the whole-cell activity of ept was greater against m. abscessus than m. tuberculosis, but crystallographic and equilibrium binding data showed that ept binds leursmabs and leursmtb with similar residues and dissociation constants.  as such, m. abscessus is clinically resistant to the entire regimen of front-line m. tuberculosis drugs, and treatment with antibiotics that do inhibit m. abscessus in the lab results in cure rates of 50% or less.  nontuberculous mycobacterial infections caused by mycobacterium abscessus are responsible for a range of disease manifestations from pulmonary to skin infections and are notoriously difficult to treat, due to innate resistance to many antibiotics.  key points: mycobacterium abscessus subsp.  in contrast, mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (m. paratuberculosis) is a slow-growing organism that is the causative agent of johne's disease in cattle and chronic granulomatous infections in a variety of other ruminant hosts.  mycobacterium intracellulare is a slow-growing pathogenic mycobacterium closely related to mycobacterium avium.  mycobacterium abscessus is a rapid-growing, multidrug-resistant, non-tuberculous mycobacterial species responsible for a variety of human infections, such as cutaneous and pulmonary infections. ||| ",Yes
Is phospholamban a regulatory/inhibitory protein of the Ca ATPase SERCA?,Yes,"Phospholamban (PLN) is a regulatory protein that functions as an inhibitory cofactor for cardiac Ca-ATPase (SERCA2). It is a pentameric transmembrane phosphoprotein that regulates the activity of the Ca(2+)-transporting ATPase (SERCA2a) in the cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum. Phospholamban modulates the active transport of Ca2+ by the cardiac sarcoplasmic reticular Ca(2+)-ATPase enzyme (SERCA2) into the lumen of the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Steady-state and presteady-state kinetic studies of the Ca pump ATPase suggest that phospholamban functions as an inhibitory cofactor for cardiac Ca ATPase (SERCA 2). Phospholamban is a phosphoprotein that regulates the apparent Ca(2+) affinity of the sr Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA2). Phospholamban (PLB) regulates the cardiac Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA2a) in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR).

Phospholamban (PLB) is a pentameric protein that plays an important role in regulating cardiac contractility via a reversible inhibitory association with the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ATPase (SERCA","phospholamban (pln) functions as an inhibitory cofactor for cardiac ca-atpase (serca2).  phospholamban is a pentameric transmembrane phosphoprotein that regulates the activity of the ca(2+)-transporting atpase (serca2a) in cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum.  phospholamban is a regulatory phosphoprotein which modulates the active transport of ca2+ by the cardiac sarcoplasmic reticular ca(2+)-atpase enzyme (serca2) into the lumen of the sarcoplasmic reticulum.  functional properties of phospholamban by steady-state and presteady-state kinetic studies of ca pump atpase suggest that phospholamban functions as an inhibitory co-factor for cardiac ca atpase (serca 2).  phospholamban is a phosphoprotein in the cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum (sr) which regulates the apparent ca(2+) affinity of the sr ca(2+)-atpase (serca2).  phospholamban (plb) regulates the cardiac ca2+-atpase (serca2a) in sarcoplasmic reticulum (sr).  phosphorylation by protein kinase a and dephosphorylation by protein phosphatase 1 modulate the inhibitory activity of phospholamban (pln), the endogenous regulator of the sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum calcium ca(2+) atpase (serca).  phospholamban (plb) is a pentameric protein that plays an important role in regulating cardiac contractility via a reversible inhibitory association with the sarcoplasmic reticulum ca2+atpase (serca), the enzyme responsible for maintaining correct calcium homeostasis.  these findings indicate that phospholamban is an inhibitor of the ca2(+)-atpase in cardiac sr and phosphorylation of phospholamban relieves this inhibition.  the sarcoplasmic reticulum (sr) ca2+-atpase (serca2a) is under the control of an sr protein named phospholamban (pln).  the mechanism by which phospholamban inhibits the ca2+ pump is unknown, but our findings with the synthetic peptide suggest that a direct interaction between the ca2(+)-atpase and the hydrophilic portion of phospholamban may be one of the mechanisms for regulation.  these results indicate that phospholamban suppresses ca2+ pump atpase at two different sites, the cytoplasmic domain for vmax and the transmembrane domain for kca, and that camp-dependent phosphorylation de-suppresses these inhibitory effects on the atpase.  phospholamban, which is a reversible inhibitor of serca2, represses the enzyme's activity, and this inhibition is relieved upon phosphorylation of phospholamban in response to beta-adrenergic stimulation.  phospholamban is the regulator of the cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum (sr) ca(2+)-atpase activity and an important modulator of basal contractility in the heart.  phospholamban alters the apparent calcium affinity of serca in a process that is modulated by phosphorylation via the β-adrenergic pathway.  protein kinase a-catalyzed phosphorylation of phospholamban results in the dissociation of phospholamban from the ca atpase, thus augmenting the atpase activity.  in this way, phospholamban is an important regulator of serca2-mediated myocardial relaxation during diastole.  regulation of the sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum ca2+-atpase (serca 2a) depends on the phosphorylation state of phospholamban (plb).  phospholamban, a putative regulator of cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum ca2+ transport, has been shown to be phosphorylated in vitro by camp-dependent protein kinase and an intrinsic ca2+-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase activity.  phospholamban (pln) is a key regulator of ca(2+) homeostasis and contractility in the heart. ||| ",Yes
Is there any protein that undergoes both mono-ubiquitination and poly-ubiquitination?,Yes,".

     The process of ubiquitination, involving the attachment of ubiquitin molecules to lysine residues on substrate proteins, can result in either mono- or polyubiquitination. The versatility of this post-translational modification allows for the targeting of proteins to different fates. The functional consequences of the type of ubiquitination vary, with polyubiquitinated proteins being targeted for degradation by the proteasome, and monoubiquitination implicated in other cellular functions. The interplay between different ubiquitin-conjugating and ubiquitin-ligase enzymes can generate diverse ubiquitinated proteins topologies, including proteins that undergo both mono- and polyubiquitination.","proteins can be both mono- or poly-ubiquitinated.  addition of ubiquitin or ubiquitin chains to target proteins leads to their mono- or polyubiquitination, respectively.  ubiquitination involves the attachment of ubiquitin (ub) to lysine residues on substrate proteins or itself, which can result in protein monoubiquitination or polyubiquitination.  ubiquitination is a versatile and dynamic post-translational modification in which single ubiquitin molecules or polyubiquitin chains are attached to target proteins, giving rise to mono- or poly-ubiquitination, respectively.  ubiquitination involves the attachment of ubiquitin to lysine residues on substrate proteins or itself, which can result in protein monoubiquitination or polyubiquitination.  protein (poly-)ubiquitination is a posttranslational modification that plays a key role in almost all cellular processes.  in the current review, we discuss mechanisms utilized by the ub-conjugating and ub-ligase enzymes to generate structural diversity during protein ubiquitination, with a focus on recent mechanistic insights into protein monoubiquitination and polyubiquitination.  ubiquitination is a post-translation modification in which ubiquitin chains or single ubiquitin molecules are appended to target proteins, giving rise to poly- or monoubiquitination, respectively.  the ability of the ubiquitination pathway to generate different protein-ub structures provides versatility of this pathway to target proteins to different fates.  protein ubiquitination is a multi-functional post-translational modification that affects all cellular processes.  ubiquitylation is best known for its role in protein turnover.  the functional consequences of the type of ubiquitination vary, such that polyubiquitinated proteins are targeted for degradation by the proteasome, whereas monoubiquitination is implicated in other cellular functions, including endocytic trafficking and dna repair.  protein ubiquitination requires a cascade of three enzymes, where the interplay between different ubiquitin-conjugating and ubiquitin-ligase enzymes generates diverse ubiquitinated proteins topologies.  the activity, localization and fate of many cellular proteins are regulated through ubiquitination, a process whereby one or more ubiquitin (ub) monomers or chains are covalently attached to target proteins.  ubiquitination is an important post-translational process involving attachment of the ubiquitin molecule to lysine residue/s on a substrate protein or on another ubiquitin molecule, leading to the formation of protein mono-, multi- or polyubiquitination.  these include monoubiquitinated proteins, polyubiqutinated proteins with homotypic chains through a particular lysine on ub or mixed polyubiquitin chains generated by polymerization through different ub lysines.  ubiquitination is one of the most common post-translational modifications of proteins, and mediates regulated protein degradation among other cellular processes.  here, we discuss the potential cellular strategies for generating monoubiquitinated proteins using a few, relatively well characterized examples of monoubiquitinated proteins.  ubiquitination is an important post-translational protein modification that functions in diverse cellular processes of all eukaryotic organisms.  overall, our results imply that ubiquitination can modify the biophysical properties of the attached protein in the folded state and that, in some proteins, different ubiquitination sites will lead to different biophysical outcomes. ||| ",Yes
Has depression been shown to be a predictor of frailty?,No,"The context provided does not support the claim that depression has been shown to be a predictor of frailty. Instead, the study focuses on the role of physical frailty as a predictor of incident major depressive disorder (MDD) in older adults. The study examines whether frailty and pre-frailty are associated with an increased risk of depression in a prospective cohort of community-dwelling older people. The results indicate that physical frailty predicted the onset of depressed mood with a hazard rate of 1.26 (95% confidence interval 1.09-1.45, p = .002). However, there is no mention of depression as a predictor of frailty.","this study examines whether physical frailty predicts a higher incidence of depression, as well as a less favorable course of depression.  depressive symptoms are associated with frailty.  although frailty is a well-established risk factor for adverse health outcomes in later life, little is known about the role of physical frailty on the development of incident major depressive disorder (mdd).  in this paper, we aimed to investigate whether frailty and pre-frailty are associated with an increased risk of depression in a prospective cohort of community-dwelling older people.  therefore, we examined whether frailty and frailty-related biomarkers predict mortality among depressed older patients.  in late-life depression, frailty identifies older patients at increased risk of adverse negative health outcomes.  the purpose of this study was to determine whether frailty is an important and independent predictor of incident major depressive disorder (mdd) in elderly people without probable depression at baseline.  in our study of 378 older patients aged ≥ 60 years with a depressive disorder (dsm-iv criteria), we examined whether frailty predicts time-to-death during a 6-year follow-up using cox proportional hazard regression analyses adjusted for confounders.  frailty and pre-frailty are two common conditions in the older people, but whether these conditions could predict depression is still limited to a few longitudinal studies.  physical frailty predicted the onset of depressed mood with a hazard rate of 1.26 (95% confidence interval 1.09-1.45, p = .002).  because physical frailty predicts both the onset and course of late-life depressed mood, physical frailty should receive more attention in mental health care planning for older persons as well as its interference with treatment.  depressive symptoms were strongly associated with frailty, and there was a gradient effect across the entire range of the ces-d scale.  frailty and depressive symptoms are common issues facing older adults and may be associated.  to determine if: (i) depressive symptoms are associated with frailty; (ii) there is a gradient in this effect across the range of depressive symptoms; and (iii) the association between depressive symptoms and frailty is specific to particular types of depressive symptoms (positive affect, negative affect, somatic complaints, and interpersonal relations).  similar to frailty, late-life depression is also associated with increased mortality rates.  the present study supports a significant role of physical frailty as a predictor of incident mdd in older adults.  clinicians should consider assessing frail older adults for the presence of depression.  among older community dwellers, frailty and pre-frailty did not predict the onset of depression during 2 years of follow-up, when accounting for potential confounders, whilst slow gait speed considered alone may predict depression in the older people.  in a logistic regression analysis, adjusted for 18 potential baseline confounders, pre-frailty (odds ratio (or) = 0.89; 95% confidence interval (ci), 0.54-1.46; p = 0.64) and frailty (or = 1.22; 95% ci, 0.90-1.64; p = 0.21) did not predict the onset of depression at follow-up.  late-life depression and physical frailty are supposed to be reciprocally associated, however, longitudinal studies are lacking. ||| ",Yes
Is phospholamban phosphorylated by Protein kinase A?,Yes,"Phospholamban is indeed phosphorylated by Protein Kinase A, as evidenced by the context. The activation of the beta-adrenergic system leads to the alteration of the structure of Protein Kinase A, which in turn results in the phosphorylation of phospholamban. This process is mediated by cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). The phosphorylation of phospholamban by Protein Kinase A is one of the three distinct sites of phosphorylation, the others being by a Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent protein kinase and an endogenous Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase.","phospholamban is phosphorylated by three different protein kinases (camp-dependent, ca2+.cam-dependent and ca2+.phospholipid dependent) at apparently distinct sites.  phospholamban, the cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum proteolipid, is phosphorylated by camp-dependent protein kinase, by ca2+/phospholipid-dependent protein kinase, and by an endogenous ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase, the identity of which remains to be defined.  phosphorylation by protein kinase a and dephosphorylation by protein phosphatase 1 modulate the inhibitory activity of phospholamban (pln), the endogenous regulator of the sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum calcium ca(2+) atpase (serca).  phospholamban is a pentameric transmembrane phosphoprotein that regulates the activity of the ca(2+)-transporting atpase (serca2a) in cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum.  we recently reported that phospholamban, the activator of the cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium pump, is phosphorylated by both camp-dependent protein kinase and a membrane-bound, ca2+/calmodulin-dependent phospholamban kinase.  the aim of this study was therefore to characterize the latter kinase, called phospholamban kinase.  it also phosphorylates phospholamban present in vesicles of cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum and smooth muscle microsomal fractions, and in transformants of escherichia coli which contain a plasmid into which a gene encoding phospholamban has been inserted.  phospholamban is a phosphoprotein regulator of cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum which is phosphorylated in response to beta-adrenergic stimulation.  the activation of the beta-adrenergic system promotes g protein stimulation that, via cyclic adenosine monophosphate (camp), alters the structure of protein kinase a (pka) and leads to phospholamban (plb) phosphorylation.  in the present study, we hypothesized that there is an imbalance between phospholamban phosphorylation and dephosphorylation, with prevalence of protein phosphorylation.  it has now been found that phospholamban consists of 2 distinct proteins; one is the specific substrate for the camp-dependent phosphorylation, and the other for the calmodulin-dependent kinase.  the degree of phospholamban phosphorylation determined by the interaction of specific protein kinases and phosphatases may represent an important control for sarcoplasmic reticulum function and, thus, for the contraction-relaxation cycle in the myocardium.  cyclic gmp-dependent protein kinase phosphorylates purified phospholamban.  phospholamban, a putative regulator of cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum ca2+ transport, has been shown to be phosphorylated in vitro by camp-dependent protein kinase and an intrinsic ca2+-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase activity.  phospholamban (plb), a 52-amino acid protein, regulates the ca-atpase (calcium pump) in cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum (sr) through plb phosphorylation mediated by beta-adrenergic stimulation.  this suggests that phospholamban was more highly phosphorylated in cardiac hypertrophy.  phospholamban is a 52-amino-acid protein that assembles into a pentamer in sarcoplasmic reticulum membranes.  cyclic amp- and calmodulin-dependent phosphorylation of phospholamban occurred independently; when both kinases were operative, the amounts of phosphorylation were additive.  these data suggest that phospholamban kinase might be an isoenzyme of the multifunctional ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase.  phospholamban kinase and glycogen phosphorylase b kinase share the same substrate specificity. ||| ",Yes
Does melanoma  occur in people of African origin ?,Yes,"Melanoma, a malignant tumor of melanocytes, has been observed to occur in individuals of African origin.

Is it safe to take isotretinoin during pregnancy?,No,".

     Isotretinoin is not safe to take during pregnancy. The use of isotretinoin during pregnancy has been associated with severe malformations in neonates. The teratogenic effects of isotretinoin can be avoided by using reliable contraception to prevent pregnancies impacted by teratogenic-effects. The risk for potential isotretinoin-exposed pregnancy was found to be 3.6 per 1000 treated women over a 5-year observation period. Despite the use of risk management programs worldwide, women have still become pregnant during isotretinoin intake and opted for pregnancy termination. Therefore, it is recommended that pregnancy should be ruled out before isotretinoin is prescribed.","in this study, we evaluated the fetal outcomes of pregnant women who had inadvertently been exposed to isotretinoin during or before pregnancy.  severe malformations have been documented in neonates whose mothers had taken isotretinoin during pregnancy.  methods: to review the use of isotretinoin during pregnancy, we carried out a comprehensive search of literature in google scholar, scopus and pubmed/medline from their inception until april 2015.  one woman, exposed to isotretinoin up to the fourth week of gestation, decided ongoing her pregnancy with no current drug-related complications.  this is the first study of the pharmacokinetics of isotretinoin in women of childbearing age (n = 11).  the teratogenic effects of isotretinoin can be avoided, and numerous recommendations and regulations are in force to minimize the risk of pregnancy during treatment.  the risk for potential isotretinoin-exposed pregnancy was 3.6 (95% ci 2.0-7.0) per 1000 treated women over the 5-year observation period.  we present a case of both-ear malformation in a newborn whose mother had taken isotretinoin for 2 years until one month prior to the time when she became pregnant.  isotretinoin (13-cis-retinoic acid, accutane) increases the risk of major congenital malformations in infants exposed to isotretinoin during pregnancy.  although many risk management programs worldwide have been used to prevent isotretinoin-related teratogenicity, the results of the present study showed that women became pregnant during isotretinoin intake and opted for pregnancy termination.  the main outcome was the proportion of women who used systemic isotretinoin and had a concomitant record of (hormonal or intrauterine) contraception use covering the isotretinoin treatment period when pregnancy is contraindicated.  reproductive-age women treated with isotretinoin require reliable contraception to prevent pregnancies impacted by teratogenic-effects.  we conducted an anonymous survey of women of childbearing potential taking isotretinoin for at least 2 months.  exposing to isotretinoin among pregnant women has still occurred due to detrimental adherence to risk reduction programs which resulted in live-born infants with different kinds of abnormalities.  to minimize fetal exposure to isotretinoin, the program requires that female patients capable of becoming pregnant use two forms of contraception or commit to abstinence while using this therapy.  pregnancy should be ruled out before isotretinoin is prescribed.  the clinical efficacy and tolerability of isotretinoin was investigated, and the correlation between these data and steady-state serum concentrations of isotretinoin was tested.  we enrolled healthy reproductive-age women initiating isotretinoin and using an etonogestrel implant.  before prescribing isotretinoin, physicians usually inquire about pregnancy and perform serologic tests including cholesterol, triglycerides, and liver enzymes.  to describe isotretinoin prescription patterns for women aged 15-45 years, assess the concomitancy of isotretinoin and contraceptive use, and determine the rate of potential isotretinoin-exposed pregnancies in estonia. ||| ",No
Does amiodarone affect thyroid hormone receptors in the myocardium?,Yes,"The evidence suggests that amiodarone, a potent antiarrhythmic drug, may exert its effect, at least partially, by antagonizing the thyroid hormone at the receptor level. This is supported by the observation that amiodarone exerts an inhibitory effect on the binding of T3 to thyroid hormone receptors (TR) alpha-1 and beta-1 in vitro. Furthermore, amiodarone has been shown to affect the levels of thyroid hormone receptor (TR) messenger RNA (mRNA) subtypes in mouse hearts. These findings suggest that amiodarone does indeed affect thyroid hormone receptors in the myocardium.","amiodarone, a powerful antiarrhythmic drug, may exert its effect by antagonism of the thyroid hormone, probably at the receptor level.  in conclusion, our study confirms that the antiarrhythmic action of amiodarone may be (at least partially) mediated by its action on thyroid hormone metabolism, and may justify the hypothesis that an altered peripheral metabolism of thyroid hormones may play a role in the pathogenesis of complex ventricular arrhythmias.  we tested the hypothesis that the antiarrhythmic effect of amiodarone might be mediated by its effect on the metabolism of thyroid hormones.  amiodarone, an iodine-containing antiarrhythmic drug, has been reported to interfere with thyroid function and thyroid hormone metabolism.  amiodarone is an anti-arrhythmic drug that commonly affects the thyroid, causing hypothyroidism or thyrotoxicosis.  amiodarone, an antiarrhythmic agent, is also known to have important effects on the peripheral metabolism of thyroid hormones; the relationship between these two effects of the drug, however, is not well established.  this study examined whether or not the electrophysiological effect of amiodarone on the heart is mediated through its action on thyroxine metabolism.  amiodarone treatment of the rat was used as a model to determine the influence of the drug on thyroid hormone-regulated gene expression in the myocardium and liver; interactions between amiodarone and thyroid status were examined in hypothyroid and tri-iodothyronine (t3)-treated animals.  this review evaluates the hypothesis that the cardiac effects of amiodarone can be explained-at least partly-by the induction of a local 'hypothyroid-like condition' in the heart.  although amiodarone is regarded as a highly effective anti-arrhythmic agent, its use may lead to alterations in thyroid gland function and/or thyroid hormone metabolism, partly because of its rich iodine content.  treatment with the antiarrhythmic agent amiodarone results in alterations in thyroid hormone metabolism, and can induce either hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism (amiodarone-associated thyrotoxicosis, aat).  these results support a thyroid hormone-dependent action of amiodarone.  amiodarone is a potent new antiarrhythmic drug that has multiple effects on thyroid function, including inhibition of extrathyroidal triiodothyronine production and rarely, iodine-induced hypothyroidism.  prevalence of amiodarone-induced thyroid dysfunction.  since both drugs had roughly similar effects on thyroid hormone metabolism but different ones on the ecg, our results provide indirect evidence against the hypothesis that the antiarrhythmic effects of amiodarone are mediated through a decrease in the serum t3 presented to the peripheral tissues.  amiodarone, an iodinated benzofuran derivative, has electrophysiologic effects on cardiac muscle akin to those of hypothyroidism.  the aim of this study was to investigate whether amiodarone affects the levels of thyroid hormone receptor (tr) messenger rna (mrna) subtypes in mouse hearts.  evidence supporting the hypothesis comprises the observation that amiodarone exerts an inhibitory effect on the binding of t3 to thyroid hormone receptors (tr) alpha-1 and beta-1 in vitro, and on the expression of particular t3-dependent genes in vivo.  a number of the cardiovascular effects of amiodarone resemble those of hypothyroidism, prompting examination of the relationship between the actions of the drug and thyroid hormones.  amiodarone is used in patients with arrhythmias, but thyroid dysfunction  is a common adverse effect. ||| ",Yes
Is osteocrin expressed exclusively in the bone?,No,"Justification: The context provided discusses the expression and function of osteocalcin, a bone-specific protein synthesized by osteoblasts. However, it does not provide information on osteocrin, a different protein. Therefore, it cannot be determined from the context whether osteocrin is expressed exclusively in the bone.","osteocalcin is an abundant, highly conserved bone-specific protein that is synthesized by osteoblasts.  osteocalcin is synthesized only by the osteoblast and it is secreted into the bone matrix at the time of bone mineralization.  the osteocalcin gene encodes a 6-kda polypeptide, which represents one of the most abundant noncollagenous bone proteins, and the present studies establish that osteocalcin mrna is detected only in bone tissue.  osteocalcin (oc) is the most abundant non-collagenous bone protein and is determinant for bone mineralization.  osteocalcin (oc) is a bone-specific protein secreted by osteoblasts and often used as a bone formation biomarker.  osteocalcin is a major noncollagenous protein component of bone extracellular matrix, synthesized and secreted exclusively by osteoblastic cells in the late stage of maturation, and is considered indicator of osteoblast differentiation.  osteocalcin (oc), an extracellular calcium-binding protein of bone origin, is synthesized by osteoblasts and binds with high specificity to bone mineral crystals.  osteocalcin is one of the most abundant noncollagenous proteins in bone.  osteocalcin is one of the most abundant noncollagenous proteins found in adult bone.  these data indicate that oc mrna is not restricted to cells on mineralizing surfaces, but is also found in megakaryocytes and peripheral blood platelets, which possibly contribute to the oc levels in blood and the regulation of bone turnover.  osteocalcin is a hormone produced in bones by osteoblasts and regulating energy metabolism.  osteocalcin, the gamma-carboxyglutamic acid-containing protein, which is the most abundant noncollagenous protein of bone and dentin, is considered to play roles in bone formation and remodeling.  osteocalcin, a bone-specific protein and marker of the mature osteoblast, is expressed only in nonproliferating osteoblasts in a mineralizing extracellular matrix, while type i collagen is expressed in proliferating cells.  osteocalcin (oc) is the main non-collagenous hydroxyapatite-binding protein synthesized by osteoblasts, odontoblasts, and hypertrophic chondrocytes.  a role for osteocalcin in bone resorption has been suggested because of its ability to influence recruitment and differentiation of osteoclasts at the bone surface.  the mineral binding properties of osteocalcin as well as its spatial and temporal pattern of expression suggest that it plays a role during bone mineralization, however until now its biological function is unclear.  osteocalcin (bone gamma-carboxyglutamic acid-containing protein) is exclusively produced by osteoblasts, which are the major target cells of parathyroid hormone (pth) in bone.  bone, whether of endochondral or intramembranous origin, contains the vitamin k-dependent calcium binding amino acid residue gamma-carboxyglutamic acid (gla) in a small, anionic protein we have named osteocalcin.  osteocalcin (oc) is a major noncollagenous bone protein whose expression is limited almost exclusively to osteotropic tumors and mature calcified tissue (differentiated osteoblasts).  osteocalcin (oc), an abundant gamma-carboxylated protein (mol wt, 5800) of bone matrix, is used as a serum marker of bone turnover because it is considered to be uniquely synthesized by the osteoblast. ||| ",No
Is the SDHAF2 gene encoding a protein necessary for flavination of SDHA?,Yes,"The SDHAF2 gene encodes a protein that is necessary for the flavination of SDHA. This is supported by the fact that SDHAF2 is an assembly factor required for FAD insertion into the SDH1 subunit. The increased levels of SDHAF2 suggest that the stabilization of soluble FAD-SDH1 depends on SDHAF2 availability. The impaired assembly of SDH with the C-terminal SDH1 mutants also suggests that FAD binding is important to stabilize the SDH1 conformation, enabling association with SDH2 and the membrane anchor subunits. The SDH complex requires a covalent addition of FAD for catalytic function, and the enzymatic function of SDH is dependent on covalent attachment of FAD on the ~70-kDa flavoprotein subunit SDH1. Therefore, the SDHAF2 protein is necessary for the flavination of SDHA.","to date, only an assembly factor (sdhaf2) required for fad insertion into subunit sdh1 has been identified in plants.  we conclude that sdhaf4 acts on fad-sdh1 and promotes its assembly with sdh2, thereby stabilizing sdh2 and enabling its full assembly with sdh3/sdh4 to form the sdh complex.  the increased levels of sdhaf2 suggest that the stabilization of soluble fad-sdh1 depends on sdhaf2 availability.  sdh assembly appears to require fad binding but not necessarily covalent fad attachment.  recent studies have indicated that post-translational flavinylation of succinate dehydrogenase subunit a (sdha) in eukaryotes and bacteria require the chaperone-like proteins sdh5 and sdhe, respectively.  with each mutant sdh1, second-site sdh1 suppressor mutations were recovered in sdh1 permitting flavinylation, stabilization of sdh5 and sdh tetramer assembly.  these results document the basis for the sdh deficiency and pathology seen with mutations in human sdh1.  we demonstrate that the fad assembly factor sdhe, which flavinylates and activates the respiratory enzyme succinate dehydrogenase (sdh), is also required for the complete activation and flavinylation of frd.  mass spectrometry analyses revealed stable levels of fad-sdh1 in sdhaf4, together with increased levels of the fad-sdh1 assembly factor, sdhaf2, and reduced levels of sdh2 compared with the wild type.  the impaired assembly of sdh with the c-terminal sdh1 mutants suggests that fad binding is important to stabilize the sdh1 conformation enabling association with sdh2 and the membrane anchor subunits.  loss of sdhaf4 in sdhaf4 inhibited the formation of the sdh1/sdh2 intermediate, leading to the accumulation of soluble sdh1 in the mitochondrial matrix and reduced levels of sdh1 in the membrane.  mutational analyses of sdh1 implicate c-terminal region arg residues involvement in covalent flavinylation and sdh assembly.  sdhe interacted with, and flavinylated, the flavoprotein subunit frda, whilst mutations in a conserved rgxxe motif impaired the complete flavinylation and activation of frd.  how does covalent flavinylation occur in prokaryotes, which lack sdhe homologs?  sdh assembly is dependent on fad binding to sdh1 but not covalent binding.  the fp subunit of succinate dehydrogenase was found to be the only (major) flavinylated protein in the cell.  the sdh complex consists of four core subunits and multiple cofactors, which must be assembled correctly to ensure enzyme function.  the enzymatic function of succinate dehydrogenase (sdh) is dependent on covalent attachment of fad on the ~70-kda flavoprotein subunit sdh1.  succinate dehydrogenase (sdh) requires a covalent addition of fad for catalytic function.  mutation of arg(638) compromises sdh function only when present in combination with a cys(630) substitution. ||| ",Yes
Are mutations in the STXBP1 gene associated with epilepsy?,Yes,"Justification: The context provided indicates that mutations in the STXBP1 gene have been associated with various types of epilepsies, including early infantile epileptic encephalopathy with suppression-burst pattern (EIEE). De novo STXBP1 mutations have been found in individuals with EIEE, and the frequency of such mutations is more than 1% in selective cohorts with early onset epileptic encephalopathy. Additionally, a wide range of clinical findings, including multiple forms of epilepsy, have been associated with mutations in STXBP1.","mutations of its encoding gene, stxbp1, are among the most frequent genetic causes of epileptic encephalopathies.  mutations in stxbp1 have been associated with a series of (epileptic) neurodevelopmental disorders collectively referred to as stxbp1-encephalopathy (stxbp1-e).  the potential mechanisms explaining the variable clinical phenotypes caused by stxbp1 mutations are discussed and the designation of early-onset epileptic encephalopathies, including an updated genetic classification, is proposed to encompass the epileptic encephalopathies beginning in the first 6 months of life.  the authors describe 2 patients with early infantile epileptic encephalopathy caused by 2 novel mutations involving the stxbp1 gene.  mutations in stxbp1 have first been reported in early onset epileptic encephalopathy with suppression-bursts, then in infantile spasms and, more recently, in patients with non syndromic mental retardation without epilepsy.  to refine the phenotype associated with stxbp1 aberrations in early onset epileptic syndromes, we studied this gene in a cohort of patients with early onset epileptic encephalopathy.  stxbp1 (munc18-1) mutations have been associated with various types of epilepsies, mostly beginning early in life.  we analyzed clinical evolution and brain magnetic resonance imaging in 7 patients (6 females, 1 male) with early onset epileptic encephalopathies associated with stxbp1 mutations.  de novo stxbp1 mutations have been found in individuals with early infantile epileptic encephalopathy with suppression-burst pattern (eiee).  although the frequency of de novo mutations within stxbp1 for selective cohorts with early onset epileptic encephalopathy is more than 1%, there is no evidence for a hotspot within the gene.  conclusion: the stx1b rs140820592 may influence the risks of epilepsy and drug-resistant epilepsy by regulating stx1b expression in brain tissues.  a wide range of clinical findings have been associated with mutations in syntaxin binding protein 1 (stxbp1), including multiple forms of epilepsy, nonsyndromic intellectual disability, and movement disorders.  in this review we hypothesize about the potential of stxbp1 as a therapeutic target in the field of epileptic encephalopathies.  objective: this study aimed to explore the genetic association of stx1b snps with treatment response in patients with epilepsy in a han chinese population.  methods: we first examined the associations between stx1b snps and epilepsy in 1000 han chinese and the associations between stx1b snps and drug-resistant epilepsy in 450 subjects.  mutations within stxbp1 have been associated with a range of neurodevelopmental disorders implicating the pleotropic impact of this gene.  we found five novel stxbp1 mutations in patients for whom video-eeg recordings could be sampled from the beginning of the disease.  we studied nine currently asymptomatic adult stx1b mutation carriers with history of epilepsy and febrile seizures, who had been seizure-free for at least eight years without antiepileptic drug treatment, and ten healthy age-matched controls.  we were unable to detect any genotype-phenotype correlation, but unlike previously reported cases, most of the ddd patients with stxbp1 pathogenic variants did not present with very early-onset or severe epilepsy and encephalopathy, though all have developmental delay with intellectual disability and most display behavioral problems and suffered seizures in later childhood.  the authors suggest that in spite of the rarity of stxbp1 mutations, molecular analysis of stxbp1 gene should be performed in patients with early infantile epileptic encephalopathy, after exclusion of arx mutations in male patients and cdkl5 mutations in female patients. ||| ",Yes
Is CHEK2 involved in cell cycle control?,Yes,"CHEK2, also known as checkpoint kinase 2, is indeed involved in cell cycle control. It is a serine-threonine kinase that plays a crucial role in the DNA damage-response pathway. In response to DNA damage, CHEK2 is activated by phosphorylation, which in turn induces cellular responses such as DNA repair, cell-cycle regulation, or apoptosis. CHEK2 regulates cell cycle arrest at checkpoints, facilitating the repair of DNA breaks by a recombination-mediated mechanism. It also phosphorylates several important targets, such as cdc25 and p53, in the DNA damage-induced cell cycle checkpoint. Therefore, CHEK2 is an integral component of the cell cycle and the DNA damage response pathway.","they play an important role in the control of the cell cycle.  ccrk activates cdk2, which controls the cell-cycle progression by phosphorylating a threonine residue conserved in cdk2.  the chek2 kinase (chk2 in mouse) is a member of a dna damage response pathway that regulates cell cycle arrest at cell cycle checkpoints and facilitates the repair of dsdna breaks by a recombination-mediated mechanism.  cell cycle-related kinase (ccrk) is a novel protein kinase homologous to both cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (cdk7) and cak1p groups of cdk-activating kinase (cak).  the chk2 gene encodes a protein kinase that is important for the regulation of cell cycle arrest after dna damage.  checkpoint kinase 2 (chk2) is a dna damage-activated protein kinase which is involved in cell cycle checkpoint control.  we have analyzed the cell cycle regulation of human cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (cdk2), a protein closely related to the cell cycle-regulatory protein kinase cdc2.  chek2 gen encodes cell cycle checkpoint kinase 2 that participates in the dna repair pathway, cell cycle regulation and apoptosis.  these findings suggest that cdk2 and cdc2, in association with distinct cyclins, regulate separate functions in the mammalian cell cycle.  the chek2 gene encodes the chk2 protein, which is kinase involved in dna repair processes.  checkpoint kinase 2 (chk2) is a serine-threonine kinase with a role in dna repair, cell cycle arrest or apoptosis in response to dna damage.  we find that cdk2 activity, like that of cdc2, oscillates during the cell cycle in cultured mammalian fibroblasts.  chk2/hcds1 plays important roles in the dna damage-induced cell cycle checkpoint by phosphorylating several important targets, such as cdc25 and p53.  if a cell is exposed to exogenous damage to its dna, chk1/chk2 stops the cell cycle to give time to the cellular mechanisms to repair dna breakage and apoptosis too, if the damage is not repairable to activate programmed cell death.  chk1: gene encodes for a serine/threonine kinase involved in the regulation of cell cycle progression and dna damage checkpoints.  checkpoint kinase 1 (chk1) is an integral component of the cell cycle as well as the dna damage response (ddr) pathway.  the serine threonine checkpoint kinase 2 (chk2) is a critical protein involved in the dna damage-response pathway, which is activated by phosphorylation inducing cellular response such as dna repair, cell-cycle regulation or apoptosis.  ck2 (casein kinase 2) is a serine/threonine-selective protein kinase that has been involved in a variety of cellular processes such as dna repair, cell cycle control and circadian rhythm regulation.  we identify several unexpected patterns for core cell-cycle proteins in actively proliferating (cdk2-increasing) versus spontaneously quiescent (cdk2-low) cells, including cyclin d1, the levels of which we find to be higher in spontaneously quiescent versus proliferating cells.  here, we briefly outline the molecular properties, regulation and physiological role of chek2, and review in more detail its defects that predispose to tumors, with particular emphasis on familial breast cancer. ||| ",Yes
